"Details of the relationship between “gun ownership” and “crime” matter.  For example, the total number of guns owned by people in a community may be less important than the number of households in that community that contain one or more firearms.","In the past 50 years, we have learned a lot about firearms and crime (see Criminological Highlights 2(5)#7, 4(4)#7, 6(5)#1, 14(5)#3, 15(5)#1, 17(3)#2, 17(4)#3, 18(2)#2)., One of the more important facts to consider, when thinking about gun control, is that gun attacks are much more likely to be lethal than knife attacks. Robberies with guns have a death rate about 3 times that of robberies without guns. “Robberies – particularly gun robberies – made street crime much more deadly in the US than in other developed nations” (p. 1364)., Between 1986 and 2015, the US population increased by 34% but the number of handguns introduced into the US increased from about 1.66 million in 1986 to 6.91 million in 2015.  Over the same period, however, the murder rate dropped.  Even though there are more guns in circulation, the proportion of households with firearms declined (from about 50% in 1976 to about 30% in 2014). Said differently, there are more guns, but the prevalence of households with guns is lower than it was. Prevalence is important because “In large part the supply of guns to offenders involves the diversion of guns from legal commerce and ownership, a process that is facilitated in a community where gun ownership is prevalent” (p. 1372)., These simple facts, then, complicate the suggestion that more guns mean more crime. It depends on where those guns are housed.  “It is only when incidence and prevalence of gun ownership are distinguished that survey data can provide a coherent explanation of the link between firearms availability and the use of guns in violence” (p. 1368). It would appear that the availability of guns for crime may be more linked to the prevalence of guns in households than to the number of guns (incidence) in the community generally., Early research “found that victims were 3 times as likely to die if the robbers used a gun rather than a knife or razor” (p. 1375).  It was known 40 years ago that the proportion of robberies with a gun increased directly with the prevalence of gun ownership, although the overall rate of robbery was not discernibly affected.  That still is true. Gun availability is important: Across US cities, it can be shown that an increase of 1000 gun robberies would lead to 3 or more times as many additional deaths as an increase of 1000 non-gun robberies. (p. 1375).  Similarly, robberies with high caliber handguns are similar to robberies with low caliber handguns except on one dimension: robberies with high caliber handguns are more likely to result in the death of the victim.  The old slogan that “Guns don’t kill people, people kill people” is profoundly misleading; guns, unlike other weapons, kill quickly, without much effort or skill, and at a distance. It is far easier to kill someone with a gun than, say, a knife. Gun use in violent crime is much more prevalent in America than in other wealthy nations, which explains much of the observed gap in homicide rates. Even in the US (with an estimated 300 million guns in private hands), the availability of guns to offenders “differs widely across jurisdictions and among differently situated offenders within the same jurisdiction, and that variation is reflected in weapon choice in violent crime” (1383).  This suggests that controls are having an effect, even though they are not perfect., Conclusion:  It is unlikely that countries with many guns in circulation will ever be able to eliminate the use of firearms in crime.  However, from what is known about firearms (e.g., death rates related to the prevalence of firearms and the caliber of firearms being used in crime), it would be possible to craft policies that would be helpful in reducing the lethal use of firearms.  The challenge therefore is more political than it is criminological and is in developing policy that is consistent with what we now know., Reference: Zimring, Franklin E.

"People released from prison show high rates of unemployment. When they do get work, they typically work for poverty-level wages.  This is more the case for Blacks and Hispanics than for Whites in this study even after controlling for various background factors related to employability.",", It is well established that involvement in the criminal justice system makes it difficult for people to get a job (Criminological Highlights 6(3)#2, 15(1)#7). This paper examines the casual, temporary, “informal” and formal employment of men and women during their first year after being released from prison in the Boston, Massachusetts, area., Employment rates for those released from prison are typically very low. In this study, (total) employment rates for Blacks never exceeded 50%.  The rate for Hispanics was slightly higher.  The rate for Whites was higher, but only reached 70% in one month during the 12 months after release from prison.  For those who were working, Blacks averaged about $1300/month -- about half of the income for Black workers in the US labour market as a whole. Hispanics did a bit better (about $1500/month), whereas Whites who were working were making about $2500 a month by the end of the year., In this study, 122 people were interviewed 5 times during the year after their release in order to get a detailed picture of employment and earnings. Part of the purpose in using interview data on earnings (rather than official records) was that it was a way of including temporary and informal (often cash) work., As already mentioned, Blacks and Hispanics were less likely to be employed and, if employed, made less money than Whites.  Whites, in this sample, had more health deficits (chronic pain, drug addiction, mental illness) than Blacks and Hispanics.  When controlling for these factors, then, the size of the employment deficit for Blacks and Hispanics increased dramatically. It was estimated that Blacks earned considerably less than observably identical Whites. This is attributable to two factors: lower rates of employment and lower rates of pay if employed., One possible reason for the race/ethnicity differences may be that Whites were considerably more likely than Blacks and Hispanics to find work through recommendations and referrals from their social networks.  The result of this difference was that Whites were more likely than Blacks and Hispanics to find jobs in high paying industries (e.g., construction).  Blacks and Hispanics got jobs through family and friends, but these were typically low-paying jobs. Blacks and Hispanics were also more likely than Whites to suggest that it was their criminal record that stood in the way of getting a job., Perhaps the most disturbing findings relate to race: Whites were more likely to be disadvantaged because of physical disabilities and drug addiction; hence they were less ready for employment and were more socially isolated than Blacks and Hispanics. “Despite these disadvantages, their employment rates were higher and their earnings were nearly double those of formerly incarcerated Blacks and Hispanics….  Higher levels of employment and earnings among Whites are associated with social network connections to relatively well-paying jobs” (p. 1537).  But in addition, because Blacks are more likely to have contact with potential employers as a result of a formal job search, the stigma of a criminal record appears to affect them more than it affects whites., Conclusion: Labour market outcomes for those released from prison are worse among Blacks and Hispanics than among Whites, notwithstanding various health disadvantages experienced by Whites. “The results suggest that high rates of incarceration among Blacks and Hispanics combine with the social conditions of poverty – characterized by social detachment from skilled employment and the stigma of criminality – to produce high rates of joblessness and low-wage employment” (p. 1538)., Reference:  Western, Bruce and Catherine Sirois (2019).

"Not any job will reduce the likelihood of reoffending for young people who were before the courts for serious crimes. For some young people, getting a low-quality job may be criminogenic.  For certain groups (e.g., Black youths in some labour markets) transitioning to a job that was rated as higher quality may lead to lower involvement in crime.",", It is often assumed that getting a job will reduce the likelihood that people at risk of offending will actually offend.  The evidence for this is, however, inconsistent.  This paper explores the possibility that the effect, if there is one, may depend on the quality of the job as well as the circumstances of the person who gets a job., Previous research has suggested that providing former prisoners with jobs may reduce reoffending for those over age 27, but may have little impact on younger people (Criminological Highlights 4(3)#6).  This paper explores the possibility that the effects of being employed depend, in part, on the quality of the job that a person gets., This study followed 1,195 adults (age 18-26) for 4 years who had been to court for serious crimes as adolescents (age 14-19).  They were interviewed at least annually, and self-reports of crime were collected at each interview.  Participants were asked whether they were working, and, if they had a job, they were asked 10 questions about the quality of the job.  These included such issues as how satisfied they were with the salary, supervision, advancement, status, colleagues, and workload.  These were combined into a single “job satisfaction” measure for each job they had.  Other characteristics of the job (income, benefits, whether it was full time, etc.) were also measured., In general, it would appear, in simple analyses, that those who were working were less likely to be involved in crime. However, when job satisfaction is taken into account, the “work” effect was accounted for completely by the fact that those with high job satisfaction were less involved in crime. Equally, or perhaps, more important, however, is the finding that there was no reduction in crime associated with low job-satisfaction employment. Indeed, compared to not working at all, working in the lowest quality jobs was associated with higher rates of offending.  More specifically “transitioning from not working to working in the lowest job satisfaction category is associated in a 30% increased rate of offending.” (p. 716)., Overall, “an improvement in job quality [had] no significant association with offending” (p. 721) – a finding  consistent across various sample subgroups such as different levels of criminal propensity, ages (age 18-21 vs 22-26), sexes, or economic states (prior to or during the 2008 recession). For race, however, the effects were different: “An increase in job satisfaction [for those working was] associated with a 21% reduced rate of offending among Blacks” (p. 721), but not for those who were not Black., Conclusion: It is possible that one of the reasons that often “work doesn’t work” (p. 722) in reducing offending is that “high-risk individuals with a history of criminal involvement often do not obtain the types of jobs required to improve crime related outcomes” (p. 722).  The fact that transitioning from no work to work in an unsatisfying setting was associated, if anything, with an increase in offending suggests that those concerned with helping those who have offended find jobs should be cautious about assuming that any job will be better than no job., Reference: Jaynes, Chae M.

People who reach young adulthood during a period of high crime and high incarceration rates are likely to contribute significantly to high incarceration rates throughout their lives.  The reason is simple: during high crime & punishment periods they acquired serious criminal histories that result in increased punishment throughout their lives.,", “National crime rates [in the US] have dropped steadily to levels last seen in the 1960s…, but prison incarceration rates have remained approximately four times the level of the 1960s” (p. 646).   This paper suggests that a large part of the continued high rate of US imprisonment is that those who came of age in the high crime & punishment periods in the 1980s and 1990s continued to have a high likelihood of imprisonment throughout their lives., This study was carried out in the state of North Carolina (NC). NC’s crime rate, which had risen in the 1980s, had, by 2016, returned to what it was in the early 1970s.  But incarceration rates were still high. The 1980s, in NC, featured various tough-on-crime policies: “increased law enforcement activities on the streets, especially for low-level drug offences, and the enactment of mandatory sentencing laws for drug possession, trafficking and impaired driving” (p. 650). Though there was some “early” release (to avoid over-crowding), NC judges responded to the prospect of “early release” by giving longer prison sentences. In 1994, legislation came into effect mandating that the offender’s criminal history and the offence were to be the only determinants of the sentence., Comparing groups of people who turned 24 during different periods allows one to see that those who “came of age during the crime-punishment wave have elevated incarceration rates throughout their lives” (p. 659).   The data also show that people who turned 24 years old (an estimate of the age of highest criminal activity) between 1985 and 2005 had historically high likelihoods of incarceration throughout their observable lifetimes.  Said differently, coming of (high-crime-involvement) age during an especially punitive period increases the likelihood that a person will be incarcerated throughout their lifetime., The data that most strongly suggest that it is the accumulation of a criminal record that has led to continued high rates of imprisonment in NC is the finding that, controlling for offence severity, those who came of age during the high-crime-punishment period have a significantly higher likelihood of receiving a prison sentence if convicted when they are older compared to those  who came of age before the high-crime-punishment era.  Most importantly, when criminal history is controlled, those who turned 24 during the high crime &  imprisonment period were no more likely to receive a sentence of incarceration than those who came of age outside of this period.  Criminal history, then “is the primary reason behind the elevated chance of a prison sentence given a felony conviction [for] those who turned 24 during the high-crime-and-punishment period” (p. 662)., Conclusion: The crime-punishment wave during the 1980s and 1990s did, of course, generate increased incarceration rates during that period.  But its largest and most long-lasting impact appears to be that the impact of acquiring a criminal record at that time persists throughout the person’s lifetime. Hence the impact of a short-term period of increased crime and/or punishment can last for several decades because of its lasting impact on a person’s criminal record.  Looking at the other side of the coin, however, the findings in this paper remind us that policies designed to reduce court involvement and the likelihood of acquiring a criminal record can have lasting effects in reducing imprisonment rates (see Criminological Highlights 18(3)#2)., Reference: Shen, Yinzhi, Shawn D.

"The effects of requiring the police to use body-worn cameras on both police and citizen behaviour vary enough to make it impossible for any police service to conclude, without its own careful research, that the investment in this technology will have any beneficial effects.",", Requiring police to wear and use body-worn cameras (BWCs) is often seen as a method of improving the quality of police-citizen interactions and police accountability.  This paper reviews the research on the impact of this new technology (see also Criminological Highlights 15(6)#8, 16(2)#3, 16(6)#2). ., “BWCs are likely the most rapidly diffusing technologies in modern police history” (p. 3). The technology was designed to document interactions between police and citizens so that ‘objective’ records of problematic interactions could be examined.  The idea also is that the recording of interactions will deter wrongdoing or undesirable behaviour because a filmed record will remain., This review first examined 549 documents related to the use of BWCs. Within these 549 reports, only 30 adequately executed studies were found, 10 of which were from one research team. Only studies using experimental (20 studies) or quasi-experimental designs (10 studies) were included.  Two general issues were examined: (1) “The impacts of BWCs on officer behaviour, as measured by complaints against officers, officer use of force, arrest and citation behaviour” etc., and (2) “The impacts of BWCs on civilian behaviour as measured by community members’ compliance with police commands” (p. 7).  One problem with many of the studies is ‘contamination’ between treatment (BWC) and control (no-BWC).  This can happen, for example, when officers are randomly (or otherwise) assigned to wear a camera on some shifts and not others., Across the 30 studies, 12 outcome constructs were identified (e.g., use of force, complaints against police, field interviews/stop-and-frisk, traffic stops, non-traffic citations). For 7 of these 12 outcomes there were a reasonable number of studies -- 5 or more studies with results on the outcome.  For only 1 of these 7 outcomes was there an overall effect: there was a 17% reduction in “complaints against officers” when BWCs were being used. Though the effect was significant overall, it is important to note that in 8 of the 22 studies that examined this construct there was either no reduction or an apparent increase in complaints associated with the use of BWCs.  The only other significant overall finding – an overall increase in non-traffic citations – was based on only two studies and hence it is risky to draw firm conclusions about it., “Use of force” was the most frequently examined construct (26 of the 30 studies). There was no overall effect of BWCs on use of force.  Indeed, the most important finding was heterogeneity across studies, with BWCs associated with decreased use of force in some studies and increased use of force in others., This “meta-analysis of 30 studies and 116 effects of police use of BWCs finds that this technology produces few clear or consistent impacts on police or citizen behaviours. Across a variety of outcome measures – including police use of force, complaints against officers, arrests, proactive police activities, assaults or resistance against officers, citizen calls for police service, and others, individual studies have produced a mix of positive, negative, and null findings” (p. 31).  Though there does appear to be an overall reduction in complaints against the police, “It is unclear… to what extent this represents improvements in the behaviours of officers and citizens toward one another… or a decline in the willingness of citizens to file complaints against officers” (p. 31)., Conclusion: Given the variability across studies, and the fact that most of the studies used ‘true experiments’ providing rather reliable evidence, “if law enforcement agencies continue to acquire BWCs, they and their communities should temper their expectations about them. This systematic review does not provide strong support that BWCs have the impacts on certain outcomes that were initially expected” (p. 34)., Reference: Lum, Cynthia & 7 others (2020).

"When the police at a formal interrogation ask accused people questions about incriminating evidence that doesn’t exist, those listening to the interrogation are likely to believe that the accused is guilty.",", One of the most influential textbooks on police interrogations encourages police to use “a ‘bait question’ [which] involves asking about hypothetical evidence that may not exist” (p. 902). Though little is known about whether this approach is useful as a lie detection tool, this paper adds to our knowledge of an important related matter: Does the use of bait questions “cause memory distortion for what evidence really does and does not exist”?(p. 902)., Previous research has suggested that “bait questions supply misleading post-event information that [those hearing about it] then incorporate into their memory for the case report” (p. 904).  This paper takes it one step further: Could this memory distortion affect the outcome of a criminal trial by increasing the perception of guilt by decision makers?, The paper presents three experiments that attempt not only to see whether those hearing ‘bait questions’ being asked are likely to see the accused as guilty, but also to try to understand why this happens.  The structure of the experiments was quite similar. A hypothetical crime (a murder or a robbery) was described.  The manner in which the police identified the prime suspect was explained and key pieces of evidence (six in the first experiment) were presented.  Participants read a (hypothetical) transcript of the police interrogation of the prime suspect in which, for some study participants, a ‘bait question’ was included: “Is there any reason we would find a witness who saw you leaving the docks that night?” (p. 908). The bait question implied a fact – that the accused was leaving the docks that night – for which there was no evidence.  The suspect in the case rejected the evidence as impossible., The first experiment was designed to see whether the effect of the ‘bait question’ varied across types of cases.  The cases varied on whether the misleading evidence was strong or only circumstantial evidence.  And there were either two or four misleading (bait) questions.  The result suggested that these differences had no effect on the verdicts that study participants offered.  However, in all cases, where the police asked at least one ‘bait’ question (implying that the accused was guilty), the study participants were more likely to view the accused as being guilty. Without any bait questions 29% of the respondents thought that the accused should be found guilty.  With any bait questions (implying strong or circumstantial evidence), the accused was more likely to be seen as guilty (38% to 47% saw him as guilty, across the 4 conditions).  The second and third experiments tried, unsuccessfully, to determine how misleading hypothetical evidence affects case outcome., Taken as a whole, it is suggested that “ambiguous, nonprobative evidence can inflate guilt perception” (p. 920).  About a third of the subjects in the second and third experiments who were exposed to ‘bait questions’ incorrectly remembered the evidence as having been collected by the police.  These respondents, not surprisingly, were more likely to view the defendant as being guilty., Conclusion: Hearing that the police, when interrogating a suspect, asked a question implying the existence of incriminating evidence that they did not have, appears to increase the likelihood that an accused person would be seen as guilty even when the evidence was never actually introduced.  The findings from this study “strongly suggest that jurors may not differentiate [between] the real evidence heard in trial and the non-existent bait question evidence in memory” (p. 921). “Bait questions, then, distort memory for what evidence actually exists” (p. 922)., Reference: Crozier, William E., Timothy J.

A systematic review of the practice of mandatory arrest for domestic violence concludes that arrest does not reduce the likelihood that another offence will occur.,", Prior to the 1980s, domestic violence was often seen, in many places, as being a private matter that did not necessarily justify police involvement.  In 1984, a highly publicized, but somewhat flawed, experiment was published that suggested that ‘mandatory arrest’ by the police of men who assaulted their spouses would reduce similar re-offending.  This paper examines the research related to this suggestion., Given the range of circumstances of those involved in crime, the range of severity of the assaults, and the range of alternatives approaches that might be available, mandatory responses to crime can have serious unanticipated consequences (see Criminological Highlights 19(1)#1).   Nevertheless, mandatory arrest policies are common (28 US states have mandatory/preferred arrest statutes for domestic violence)., The first experiment on mandatory arrest was published in 1984 and between then and 2015, there were 10 additional attempts to examine the impact of mandatory arrest.  In all cases, immediate arrest (or the issuing of an arrest warrant) was compared to some other treatment (no arrest, mediation, separation, a protective order, counselling, etc.)., In the analyses carried out for this paper, if a study contrasted ‘arrest’ with two or more alternative treatments (e.g., mediation or a protection order), these multiple comparison groups were combined into a single “no arrest” comparison group.  In other words, this paper contrasts “arrest” with “something else” (which varied across studies).  Repeat offending was operationalized in a variety of different ways.  In some studies, any new offence was counted as a repeat offence. In others, calls for service by or on behalf of the original victim for a new domestic violence incident was used as the outcome variable., The fact that this meta-analysis relies on official records (rather than reports of victims) is obviously a limitation on the findings since it is possible that certain treatments (arrest, mediation, counselling, for example) may affect the likelihood that a domestic violence victim will report a subsequent offence by the same offender to the police.  However, in cases in which both official records and victimization reports were included in the original paper, the results tended to be the same., Looking at the 11 studies as a group, there was no overall impact of mandatory arrest on subsequent domestic violence or offending more generally.  There was, however, some variability across studies suggesting that there may be specific circumstances/ locations/ procedures that are used by the police that are effective even though looking across studies, the “mandatory arrest” of domestic violence suspects as a broad construct was ineffective in reducing subsequent offending., Conclusion:  “The results of the meta-analysis (of the 11 studies identified in this paper) suggest that the mandatory arrest policies adopted by police departments in the 1980s and 1990s did not produce the desired deterrent effect sought by law enforcement agencies and advocates alike. That is, arrest did not have a significant effect in reducing the likelihood of repeat offending among individuals arrested for domestic violence” (p. 7).   It would seem that the burden of proof to demonstrate ‘effectiveness” should be on those advocating or implementing ‘mandatory arrest’ policies., Reference: Hoppe, Susan J., Yan Zhang, Brittany E.

Increasing levels of public concern about sex offenders – fed largely in the US by national media –   can have the effect of increasing the punishments handed down by the courts even though there is no evidence of increasing rates of sex crimes or increased seriousness of sex offense cases that come to the attention of police.,", There are many myths about sex offenders, most notably that the likelihood of the repetition of a sex offence by a person once convicted of a sex offence is high (“once a sex offender, always a sex offender”).  This and various other myths have been the subject of a substantial amount of research (see the Criminological Highlights ‘special issue’ on our website)., “Moral panics” about certain crimes are not unusual, though the focus of them does vary from place to place and time to time.  [Recent Canadian governments, for example, have made four separate changes in the “bestiality” sections of the Criminal Code and have increased the penalties for harm to certain animals, notwithstanding the fact that there was no evidence of increased problems in this area.], This paper first looks at a simple question: Were those convicted of sex offences in recent years the target of special increases in punishment?  If convicted sex offenders were targeted for increased punishment, what seemed to be driving this change?, In the 1980s and 1990s, public concern in the US about sex offenders seemed to increase.  From a policy perspective, the preferred solution appeared to be incapacitation.  Support for tougher sanctions appeared higher among those who believed that the incidence of these crimes was increasing.  This study uses Florida state court data to illustrate how sentencing for sex offenders has changed. Even though Florida sentencing guidelines did not change during the period examined (1995-2011) and more importantly, the “offence severity” of these offences are fixed in the statute, judges have the discretion to change the severity of sentences by departing from guidelines.   In this study, changes in the severity of the courts’ responses to sex offences were compared to changes (if any) in courts’ responses to other offences., Between 1995 and 2011, the likelihood that a sex offender would be imprisoned increased substantially more than the increase in the likelihood of incarceration for an offender convicted of other violent, drug, property or other offences.  Similarly, sentence length increased more dramatically for sex offenders than for any of these other groups of offenders. “Changes in sanctioning practices during the study period cannot be attributed to changes in the average severity of sex offences or the composition of sex offences….” (p. 105).  In other words, the changes in sentencing did not reflect changes in the offences: the average severity of sex offences was stable. It was only punishment for them that increased., During the period that was studied, rates of sexual violence in Florida and in the US (overall) declined. At the same time, the number of headlines in national newspapers concerning sex offenders increased substantially, though there was a slight decline, particularly between 1995 and 1998, in headlines involving sex offences in the Florida newspapers., Conclusion: The increase in punitiveness (the likelihood being imprisoned and length of the prison sentence if a person was incarcerated) that occurred in Florida in the case of sex offences appeared to the result of increased social concerns about sex crimes, not the severity or prevalence of these offences. “Under the assumption that [the increase in media attention to these crimes] operates as a proxy measure of social concern about sex crimes, [the study] found evidence that increasing social concern about sexual violence at the national level is positively associated with, and explains some of the punitiveness toward, sex offenders in Florida state courts” (p. 105-6).  More generally, the findings suggest that those responsible for punitive responses to a particular type of offence should consider carefully what the reasons might be for changes – and in particular increases – in punitive responses., Reference: Cochran, Joshua C., Elisa L.

"Public support in the US for the expungement of criminal records is growing, especially for those who have been crime free for a reasonable time and who appear to be unlikely to reoffend.","When ‘pardon’ legislation (the Criminal Records Act) was introduced into the Canadian Parliament in 1970 by a Liberal government, a leading Conservative argued that the “main purpose of this bill is not to coddle criminals. … This criminal record has hounded them for years and has created economic difficulties. We are now making an honest attempt to eliminate these difficulties as much as possible” (see the Criminological Highlights collection Evaluating the Benefits of Pardons on our website).  This paper explores public support in the US for procedures that make criminal records inaccessible so that people, at some point after completing their sentences, can live a life outside of the shadow of a criminal record., It is estimated that perhaps as many as one in three Americans have some form of criminal record (arrest or conviction). Criminal records can affect one’s ability to vote, get a job or housing, or obtain admission to college.  Certain groups (e.g., Black Americans) are much more likely to have a criminal record than others. And in an internet age, criminal records are more easily accessible than they once were., This paper presents the results of a survey examining American support for criminal record expungement.  The perception of risk appears to be an important factor in understanding whether a person supports the expungement of records (e.g., Criminological Highlights 18(6)#7).  “Risk” can be operationalized in a number of ways, among them being the length of time a person has lived in the community crime free subsequent to criminal justice involvement.  In this survey, only 45% of respondents thought expunging criminal records was, as a general rule, a good way of allowing people to get their lives back on track.   However, 78% thought that people who had been crime free for 10 years should be eligible to have their criminal records expunged.  Probably because they incorrectly believed that “once a sex offender, always a sex offender” (see the Criminological Highlights collection on Sex Offenders and Society’s Responses to Them), many people thought certain types of sex offenders should never be able to get their criminal records expunged. Many fewer wanted to exclude all other types of offender from being eligible for record expungement.  Being employed and having completed a rehabilitation program appeared to be ‘signals’ that people looked for that persuaded them a person was ready to have their criminal record expunged., Broad support for the expungement of criminal records seemed to be most prevalent among those who believed that people who had done bad things were redeemable and that people could be rehabilitated.  What is perhaps more interesting from a political perspective is that broad support for expungement of criminal records was not related to political orientation, gender, age, race, education or income., Conclusion:  Rules for expunging criminal records vary enormously across jurisdictions.  In Pennsylvania, for example, those convicted of non-violent crimes more than 10 years earlier automatically get their criminal records suppressed as a result of a recent law that received almost unanimous support in the legislature.  The one-time cost (for software development) to implement this change was about $245,000.  Given the number of records cleared by this method, this means that the cost per person of having a record expunged is about 9 cents.  The survey reported here demonstrates that “Americans are clearly supportive of expunging the records of nonviolent offenders who have remained crime free for a decade.”  In Pennsylvania the cost is one US dime per person.  In Canada the cost to a single applicant for a ‘record suspension’ recently increased to C$657.77., Reference: Burton, Alexander L, Francis T.

The number of new immigrants coming into a country is associated with citizens wanting more funds spent on law enforcement.  The number of foreign-born people already in the community was not an important predictor of support for law enforcement.,", Former US president Donald Trump often blamed new immigrants for crime problems.  He appeared to differentiate between the flow of new immigrants (whom he tried to exclude) and the stock of foreign-born residents already in the US (like his wife) whom he appeared not to fear and whose votes he wanted. This paper addresses the role that immigration plays in eliciting support for increased law enforcement funding., The number of new immigrants has increased in many rich democracies, though there are a few countries (e.g., Poland and Japan) that continue to have small immigrant populations. “In response to rising immigration in Western Europe, animosity toward foreign born residents rose to historically high levels” (p. 1075).  Immigrants are often seen as being less law-abiding, though the existing data would suggest the opposite: areas with large numbers of immigrants tend to have lower crime rates (e.g., Criminological Highlights 18(5)#1)., If, contrary to existing evidence, immigrants are blamed for crime, it would not be surprising that native born people would favour more law enforcement spending if the number of immigrants was increasing. To the extent that “punishment practices [are] at least partly shaped by public opinion” (p. 1076), it is important to understand this relationship better.  According to minority threat theory, “Minority threat is triggered by fear and suspicion that the subordinate group intends to undermine the dominant group’s privilege and advantage” (p. 1077).  It is further suggested that these perceptions may not be driven by actual experiences but by “constructed subjective feelings, fears, and images” (p. 1079).  Prejudice and threat, then, may relate to change – in this case the “flow” of immigrants to a community, rather than the “stock” of immigrants already there.  New immigrants may be seen as a threat; foreign-born neighbours are not., Residents of 25 rich democracies that participated in the 1996 and 2006 International Social Survey Programme (including Canada, the US, South Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, and 18 European countries) were asked whether they thought their government should spend more on the police and law enforcement. Using immigration data from 1985, 1995, and 2005 allowed the researchers to estimate the size of the “stock” of immigrants for the year prior to each survey. In addition, it allowed for an estimate to be made of the change in the percent foreign born in the previous decade.  Homicide rate and number of police officers per 100,000 residents were used as control variables at the country level.  At the individual level, various demographic variables were included in the analysis including age, sex, rural/urban residence, political orientation, religion, and employment., Looking first at the country-level data, there was a very small (r=0.10) correlation between % foreign born and preference for higher law enforcement spending.  However, the correlation between the change in the percent foreign born (in 2006) was much greater (r=0.39).  Including the control factors and looking at change within country, % foreign born (the “stock” of immigrants) did not predict preference for more law enforcement spending.  However, both the change in net migration and the change in the percent foreign born did predict preference for more law enforcement spending., Conclusion: In understanding preference for more police and law enforcement, it appears that the increase in the number of immigrants is important, not the number of immigrants already in the country,  Given that the international data suggest immigration is not related to actual crime, it would appear that “fear of crime depends more on unfounded fears and prejudices resulting from changing ethnic heterogeneity than from reasonable concerns about safety” (p. 1095)., Reference: Fink, Joshua J. and David Brady (2020).

Locking people up in local jails increases the death rates in those counties in which the jails are located. The findings give further support to the hypothesis that jails are associated with the spread of infectious diseases and other health problems.,", Previous research has demonstrated a link between increases in county rates of incarceration and overall mortality rates in that county.  This should not be terribly surprising. “For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, jails [in the US] exacerbated the spread of the virus in communities that were already at a disproportionately higher risk of infection” (p.2).  This study builds on previous research by separating out causes for death that would be expected to relate to short- vs. long-term effects of high or increased rates of incarceration in local jails., The study uses longitudinal jail population data from 1,094 US counties for the period 1987-2017.  These were combined with mortality data for the period 1988-2018 for common causes of death of people who are less than 75 years old.  Various sociodemographic measures like the age and racial makeup of the country, poverty, unemployment and crime rates, and state incarceration rates were used as control factors in analyses linking releases from jail to deaths from these nine causes., The main variable of interest was average daily jail population in the county divided by the county population. The outcome measures were the 7 most common causes of death, expressed as rates, for those under age 75., When looking at the short-term relationship between change in the jail population and mortality rates in the county in which the jail was located, “changes in the county jail incarceration rate were most strongly associated with deaths caused by infectious disease, chronic lower respiratory disease, substance use, and suicide” among those age 75 and younger (p. 5).  Deaths associated with these causes tended to increase when jail populations were increasing., “Associations between county jail incarceration and cause-specific mortality rates weakened for all causes of death as the lag [between the change in jail incarceration and the death rate] increased from 1 year to 10 years” (p. 5).  The decrease in the size of the association was particularly large for causes of death with generally lower latency (e.g., infectious diseases and suicide).   Causes of death like heart disease and cerebrovascular disease – that have longer latencies, generally, between the cause and the effect – showed less pronounced declines., Conclusion:  The results – showing strong short-term associations between increased jail incarceration and infectious disease, suicide, substance abuse and chronic lower respiratory disease -- is consistent with the finding that high jail incarceration rates are associated with infectious disease spread and acute psychosocial and economic resource deprivation. It should be kept in mind that these death rates reflect deaths in the community, not in the jails.  Hence “these findings suggest that interventions to reduce incarceration might result in broader community mortality benefits….  Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, these findings highlight the immediate need to account for jails as drivers of infectious disease spread in the community” (p. 8)., Reference: Kajeepeta, Sandahya, Pia M.

"Judges may not be solely responsible for increases in imprisonment rates.  A study of sentencing, bail, policing policy and crime suggests that changes in sentencing may be almost irrelevant in explaining a 48% increase in the New South Wales (Australia) imprisonment rate.",", In most Australian states and territories, the prison population increased dramatically between 2000 and 2019.  Generally speaking, the rate of increase was larger in the second decade of the 21st century than in the first.   This paper analyzes the reason for this increase in Australia’s most populous state, New South Wales., The growth in New South Wales was dramatic: from an average of 21,714 prisoners in 2000 to 43,028 prisoners in 2019.   Part of the increase in the prison population was due to a disproportionate increase in the unsentenced (remand) population.  This, in turn, may have been the result of a large increase in the number of people proceeded against in court: an increase of 22% between 2011 and 2019. Bail refusal rates did not appear to account for a measurable amount of the increase in prison populations.  However, the length of time in remand increased for those who were eventually acquitted or given a community sentence., One change that would appear, at first glance, to implicate judges as a cause of the increase in imprisonment rates is an increase in the percent of those convicted sentenced to prison from 7.6% in 2011 to 9.8% in 2018.  However, this would appear to relate to characteristics of the cases coming to court.  For example, there were large increases between 2011 and 2018 in the percent of cases that were sexual assault and related offences, abduction/harassment, weapons offences, administration of justice, and drug offences.   Similarly, the percent of those with a prior prison sentence increased from 17.5% of cases to 23.4% of cases.  Multiple indictable offences increased from 22% of all cases to 27%.  All of these case characteristics would be likely to lead to an increased use of imprisonment., The likelihood of receiving a prison sentence increased dramatically when the comparison between 2012 and 2018 was done without controls for the nature of the offence or the offender.  However, when controls for case characteristics were made, there was no difference in the odds of receiving a prison sentence, suggesting that these case characteristics explained the increase.  Sentence length and the time that a prisoner was required to serve before being eligible for parole did not change., It is possible that some of the increase in imprisonment relates to an increase in drug arrests related to amphetamines.  However, there is no indication of increases in the incidence of other crimes that would account for changes in the nature of cases in court.  Hence, the change in the nature of cases in court seems to relate more closely to changes in the decisions to charge. For example, there was a very large increase in the number of people charged for breaches of community-based orders., Conclusion: “The evidence [in this paper] suggests that the increase in the New South Wales prison population since 2011 is largely a consequence of changes in policing policy and (to a lesser extent) crime, rather than changes in penal policy” (p. 576).  Once the changes in the nature of the cases before the courts is taken into account, there was no evidence of an increase in the punitiveness of the courts.  More generally, the data provide a reminder to those concerned with either increases in imprisonment or with over-representation of certain groups, that the placement of a person in prison is the result of multiple decisions and policies, not just the sentencing decision of the judge., Reference:  Weatherburn, Don (2020).  Is Tougher Sentencing and Bail Policy the Cause of Rising Imprisonment Rates?  A NSW Case Study.

"A 1-day training program for police focusing on ethnic/racial bias in stop and search powers was successful on paper, but not in changing the actual behaviour of police on the street.",", In the United Kingdom, as in many other countries, there is concern about ethnic and racial bias in policing.  One of the most frequent specific concerns relates to discretionary police stops and searches.  This paper examines a police training program that “sought to strengthen the foundations of officers’ use of stop and search, and focused on topics including unconscious bias, reasonable grounds for suspicion, and strategies for conducting stop and search encounters” (p. 1260).  Unlike many such training programs, this one was carefully evaluated., Police stops have been shown in many countries to focus disproportionately on certain groups – most notably Black people.  In England & Wales, for example, people who identified as Black were about 9 times as likely to be searched as were those who identified themselves as White. As a result of findings such as these, the UK College of Policing (the professional body for policing) developed a program to address concerns about police bias., The program – the main part of which involved a 6-hour classroom training session – was designed to include material to make police officers aware of the history and concerns about stop-and-search practices. It also gave training on how to assess reasonable grounds for suspicion, recording requirements, and how a stop-and-search should be carried out. Essentially there was a “competence” component focusing on the necessary skills to determine whether a stop was warranted and an “awareness” component focusing on the issue of bias., The implementation was carried out on an experimental basis in six UK police agencies. Individuals within each agency were chosen who had carried out searches in 5 of the previous 12 months and remained in a role in the police service where they might be expected to use stop and search practices.  662 police officers were assigned to the treatment group and 661 to the control group. Questionnaires about stop and search practices were distributed 6 to 54 days after the training., The results on the questionnaire demonstrated that the treatment increased knowledge of stop and search regulations. In addition, the questionnaire results suggested that there was no significant difference in the likelihood of initiating stops of suspicious people between those who had or had not received the special training.  However, those who had received the training indicated that they would be less likely to proceed and carry out a search, especially if the evidence looked weak., In line with national trends in searches, there was a decline in the number of searches carried out in the three months after the training, compared to the three months before. However, the size of this decline was unaffected by the treatment.  In other words, those who received the special training on stop-and-search were just as likely to carry out searches as those who did not receive the treatment.  The training had no reliable impact on the likelihood of searches of minority groups., Conclusion: “Overall, the results provide no evidence of any training effects on officers’ recorded street-level practices…” (p. 1277).  In certain ways, this finding is not surprising. The actual training was only 6 hours long.  There was also some variation in the training that was given in an attempt to take into account local conditions. It may be that by focusing exclusively on front line officers without much attention to supervisors and managers and not “embedding [the training] in broader multifaceted reform efforts”, this ‘one shot’ training exercise did not have much of a chance to affect actual practice in the long term. Changing a practice that is embedded in an institutional culture may not be successful unless it is part of a much larger effort., Reference: Miller, Joel, Paul Quinton, Banos Alexandrou, and Daniel Packham (2020).

"Two abrupt changes in the use of diversion in Texas (one decreasing the use if diversion from the criminal courts, the other increasing its use) demonstrate that diverting people from the criminal justice system is good policy.  Dropping the charges against those charged with low level felonies is associated with lower rates of offending in the subsequent 10 years.",", In many jurisdictions, many of those who are charged with criminal offences have all charges dropped, often in return for some form of non-criminal justice punishment.  This paper examines the impact on crime of two abrupt changes in the law in Texas related to diversion., In 1994, a change in the law made the prosecution of low-level felony drug and property crimes suddenly more likely (and diversion less likely).  In 2007, a failed initiative, that had been expected to pass and that would have increased jail capacity in Harris County, Texas, forced officials to divert more first-time felony defendants so as to avoid jail over-crowding.  Both of these changes were abrupt and, to a large extent, unanticipated.  The study looks at first-time felony defendants charged 2 years before and 2 years after the 1994 change and 2 years before and 7 years after the 2007 event.  The focus is on those most likely to have been affected by the changes that took place., The people being brought to court before and after each of these changes were very similar. For example, an overall distribution of the “predicted recidivism risk” score for those before and after the changes that took place were very similar.  What changed was that there was a substantial decrease in the use of diversion in 1994, and a substantial increase in the use of diversion in 2007.  The study then looked at the conviction rates of first-time felony defendants charged before and after each of these two changes.  The characteristics of the cases coming to court did not change. What changed was the likelihood that charges would be dropped against those charged with relatively minor offences., The impact of diversion in each of these natural experiments was the same: there was “strong and consistent evidence that diversion leads to statistically significant and economically meaningful declines in recidivism…. Diversion decreases reconviction rates by slightly more than 30 percentage points in the 1994 sample and by 26 percentage points in the 2007 sample…” (p. 17).   Diversion was also associated with increased employment, including employment stable enough to increase the likelihood that a person’s income exceeded the federal poverty level., For the group who benefitted from diversion – largely those without prior felony convictions – it appeared that there was a substantial benefit in finding employment.  This is not very surprising given the challenges that any criminal record has on the likelihood of finding employment (see, Criminological Highlights 6(3)#2, 11(4)#4, 17(2)#7). In this study of policy changes in 1994 and 2007, people who were diverted rarely had a prior felony conviction., Conclusion: This paper demonstrates that diversion of low-level defendants from prosecution increases the likelihood of employment and decreases the likelihood of future offending. It could be argued, therefore, that the paper provides “compelling evidence on a successful intervention [diversion] that both improves defendant outcomes and saves public resources…. [Furthermore] it can be feasibly implemented without significant investments or changes to current infrastructure, making it a practical solution for criminal justice reform” (p. 33)., Reference: Mueller-Smith, Michael and Kevin T.

Overrides of a risk assessment scale used by US probation officers decreased the already mediocre performance of a commonly used risk assessment tool that was designed to determine the appropriate level of intensity of supervision of federal probationers.,", It is tempting to think that it is possible to improve, systematically, the predictions made by a risk assessment scale. If a probation officer, who ostensibly knows a probationer who is being supervised, believes that the risk scale is not giving proper weight to relevant factors, shouldn’t the probation officer override the purely statistical prediction? This paper examines what happens to the accuracy of the prediction when those supervising federal probationers are allowed to override the statistical prediction instrument., In the US federal system, risk predictions are made with the Post-Conviction Risk Assessment instrument, a 15-item scale using both static and dynamic risk factors.  Probation officers have the explicit power to place supervisees into higher or lower risk categories than that recommended by the scale, though overrides are supposed to be rare., The study looks at the success in predicting rearrest for a felony or misdemeanor offence within 24 months, but excludes arrests for technical violations.  The study uses data from 259,571 people being supervised on probation in 94 federal judicial districts.  Given that they were on probation for US federal offences (not state offences), it is not surprising that the largest categories of offenders were drug (44%), financial offense (20%), and weapons offense (15%).  The study focuses on the 27,480 overrides (related to about 11% of supervisees), 99% of which moved the supervisee to a higher risk category. Sex offenders constituted 3.1% of the total sample of supervisees; however, 45% of the over-rides were for sex offenders, all of whom received increased risk levels.  The original (scale-determined) risk values placed only 20% of those sex offenders whose risk assessment were subsequently raised into a moderate- or high-risk category.  After the ‘adjustment’, over 98% ended up in a moderate- or high-risk category.   Although this was the group most likely to have their risk scores dramatically altered because of the discretionary decisions of probation supervisors, similar increased perceived risk scores were assigned to other groups of probationers., Overall, 15% of this sample were rearrested for an offence within 2 years. The policy question addressed by the study is simple: Was the accuracy of the “adjusted” risk measure (adjusted as a result of the supervisor’s override) higher than the accuracy the original ‘scale’ value?  For all groups of offenders – most notably sex offenders – the original scale value predicted better than the ‘adjusted’ risk value., One can divide the sample into two groups – low or low/moderate risk (low) vs. moderate or high risk (high).  Using the original scale value, 12% of the low risk group were rearrested and 28% of the high risk group were rearrested.  After the risk scores had been adjusted by the probation officer, about 8% of the low risk group and 17% of the high risk group was arrested for a new offence.   Large numbers of low/moderate risk people (on the original scale) were moved into the high risk category but they did not reoffend. An index of overall accuracy of the predictions showed that prediction accuracy declined as a result of the overrides., Conclusion:  The results show that subjective modifications of an ordinary “risk” scale make risk prediction worse, rather than better.  In this case, almost all of the modifications increased the “risk” of the offender being supervised.  The result is that the number of false positives – a prediction that offenders would reoffend when, in fact, they do not – increased from about 14% of the sample to about 66% of the sample.   By re-classifying large number of people as ‘high risk’ when they were not, it was almost inevitable that accuracy of prediction would decrease. At the same time, one cannot ignore another important finding: within this group of people whose risk scores were altered by supervisors but who had a relatively low likelihood of rearrest (15%), even the original scale scores did not predict very well., Reference: Cohen, Thomas H., Christopher T.

"Since the early 1990s, the prevalence of youth crime in the US has decreased dramatically. It appears this is most likely to be the result of reductions in two risk factors for youth crime: the amount of unstructured socializing and alcohol consumption.",", Reductions in youth crime have apparently occurred in the 21st century in a number of countries. In this US study, between 1991 and 2015 there was a reduction in self-reported youth crime of 35%. In Canada, between 1998 and 2015 there was a 37% reduction in crime incidents reported to the police (see Criminological Highlights 18(3)#2)., The substantial drop in offending might be a result of any of three types of changes in youths’ experiences: (a) increased social control, (b) decreases in exposure to settings where crime is likely to take place, and/or (c) reductions in criminal propensities or motivations to be involved in crime., This study uses data from a study in which a nationally representative sample of Grade 8 & 10 students from over 100 public and private schools were surveyed and asked questions on involvement in crime. The main dependent variable – prevalence of involvement in crime – was calculated based on the number of different offences (e.g., hurt someone badly, took something of value) the youth admitted to doing in the previous 12 months., In addition, a range of possible explanatory measures were assessed.  These included the amount of unstructured socializing, alcohol use, employment of the youth, parental supervision of the youth, attachment to school, as well as the educational expectations, involvement in the community, and preferences for risky or dangerous activities.  Various other control variables (e.g., sex, race, whether the youth was from a single-parent household, parental education) were also included., Over time (in models that included the control variables), the prevalence of youth offending decreased by about 35%.  However, when the potential explanatory variables were included in the model, changes in those explanatory variables appeared to account for about a third of the decrease in the prevalence of involvement in crime. When comparing 1991-1995 with 2011-2015, the data suggested that the two largest changes that accounted for the decrease in crime were a decrease in unstructured socializing and a decrease in the use of alcohol.  Considerably less of the decrease in crime was accounted for by changes in sensation seeking., Conclusion: The “results show that the decreases in unstructured socializing and alcohol consumption were significantly associated with reductions in youth delinquency between 1991 and 2015” perhaps because “contemporary youth spend much less time away from home with peers in contexts that provide limited supervision and plentiful opportunities for deviance, including alcohol consumption” (p. 129).  Hence “the results suggest an important role for reductions in unstructured socializing and alcohol consumption” (p. 130) in understanding the prevalence of youth crime in the US., Reference: Baumer, Eric P., Kelsey Cundiff, and Liying Luo (2021).  The Contemporary Transformation of American Youth: An Analysis of Change in the Prevalence of Delinquency, 1991-2015.  Criminology, 59, 109-136., Back to top",https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV19N3.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-19-no-3-%E2%80%93-april-2021,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 19, No. 3 – April 2021",Regular Issue,2021
People who are detained prior to trial are more likely to be found guilty than are equivalent people who are released into the community while awaiting trial.,"Nobody is likely to be surprised by findings suggesting that those who are detained prior to trial are more likely to be found guilty than are people who are released prior to trial.  Some of the factors that lead to detention (e.g., criminal record) are also factors that may increase the likelihood of findings of guilt and/or of harsh punishments., In order to determine whether it is detention per se that increases the likelihood of a finding of guilt, this study compares those who are detained with accused people who have an equal probability of being detained but, for unpredictable reasons, happen to be released., Cases from six large urban counties in Florida in which an accused was detained were matched with cases in which the accused was released.  This was done using a technique called ‘propensity score matching’ in which the likelihood of release was predicted for each person using such variables as offence severity, prior criminal record, age, race, offence, number of charges, whether a cash bail had been offered (but not necessarily met), prior arrests, and type of lawyer.  People who were released were then matched (on their ‘propensity score’) with people who were detained.  The main outcome variable that was examined for these two groups was the likelihood of being convicted., The comparison of the matched accused (released vs. detained) showed that about 63% of the accused people who were released were found guilty whereas 71% of the accused people who were detained prior to trial were found guilty.  It is also worth noting that many people were offered a chance at putting up cash bail, but were not able to and, as a result, were detained.   What is not clear from these results is why those who were detained were more likely to be convicted.  It could be that individuals who were detained were less able to prepare a defence or that detained individuals simply pleaded guilty at a higher rate in order to speed up the process., Conclusion: Detention before trial increases the likelihood that an accused will be convicted.  Although 41% of the original sample were in fact detained, 93% were offered some form of release, but were unable to meet the conditions of release (the deposit of cash bail).  In other words, much of the impact of pretrial detention can be traced to monetary bail terms that inherently disadvantage the already disadvantaged part of the community.  To the extent that other conditions often required for release (e.g., stable housing away from those with criminal records or an acceptable surety) also restrict release of members of disadvantaged groups, it would seem that even justice systems that do not rely on cash bail may end up convicting people in part for who they are as well as what they might have done., Reference: Lee, Jacqueline G.

"Many US post-secondary educational institutions require criminal history information from those applying for admission.  In an experimental study examining actual admissions decisions, applicants with criminal records applying to 4-year colleges were more likely to be rejected than equivalent applicants without records.",", There is substantial evidence that those with criminal records are disadvantaged when seeking employment and housing (e.g., Criminological Highlights 17(2)#6, 18(3)#6).  Given that “Higher education has long been considered an instrument of social mobility and social cohesion” (p. 157) it is important to examine whether those with criminal records are being excluded from these opportunities., Studies of youths typically demonstrate that most youths have committed what are considered to be criminal offences. Because most are never convicted, most of these ‘offences’ do not affect their later lives. However, many US colleges – especially the most competitive institutions – require applicants to disclose their criminal records. Over 80% of the top third of US colleges on ‘competitiveness’ ask criminal history questions on their applications, ostensibly because of concerns related to violence, drug use, and other crime.  There is, however, no evidence that having “criminal history questions on college applications are effective tools for reducing campus crime” (p. 161)., People were recruited to participate in this study as applicants to 4-year US colleges. Their actual high school transcripts, test scores, and criminal records were used. Other materials were produced as needed for the different applications.  Those with criminal records had a single felony conviction (for aiding and abetting robbery or for burglary). The applicants with records were matched with a young person without a record such that the person with the criminal record was always slightly better qualified academically. Two pairs of male testers were used.  When applying to a particular college, both testers described themselves as either Black/African American or White.  Criminal record was conveyed to the college only when it was asked for. The colleges that were tested were ones in which admission was plausible; the most competitive colleges were not included. 280 pairs of applications (one with a record, the other not) were completed and sent to each college. The pairs clearly were comparable: the two members of each pair (one with a record, one without) were admitted at equal rates at colleges without questions about criminal records., At colleges with questions about criminal records, 10% of people without criminal records were rejected compared to 25% of people with criminal records and slightly stronger applications.  The presence of a criminal record disadvantaged both Black and White applicants.  The effect of a criminal record appeared to be a bigger disadvantage at colleges in higher crime locations.  In addition, it was discovered in the process of carrying out the study that “it was far more difficult to complete applications that requested criminal history information” (p. 179) because of the need to file additional information.  Other studies suggest, not surprisingly, that those with criminal records are likely to drop out of the application process in part because of the extra required information and effort., Conclusion: It is clear that 4-year colleges discriminate on the basis of criminal records for both Black and White applicants.  Applicants – both Black and White – with criminal records are more likely to be rejected than those without criminal records, even though they are equally, or perhaps slightly more, qualified for admission and the records had no obvious relevance to higher education.  Given that the presence of a criminal record is not equally distributed across groups, it means that certain groups are excluded from this opportunity to succeed in modern society., Reference: Stewart, Robert and Christopher Uggen (2020).  Criminal Records and College Admissions: A Modified Experimental Audit.  Criminology, 58, 156-188., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV18N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-18-no-4-%E2%80%93-march-2020,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 18, No. 4 – March 2020",Regular Issue,2020
"It has been well known for decades that predictions of future violent offending are more often than not wrong. A sizable majority of people placed in preventive detention awaiting trial, and a sizable majority of people sentenced to longer sentences because of violence predictions, would not have committed violent crimes.",", Forty years ago, 4 of 6 people predicted to be violent were not. Today, using the best instruments, 3 of 5 predictions of future violence are wrong. Much more is now known than in earlier times. The mistaken predictions disproportionately affect members of racial and other minority groups and are in large part based on factors such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status that are per se unjust. They are heavily based on criminal history factors that result in part from racial profiling, stereotyping, and police bias., “Minority offenders are more often incorrectly predicted to be violent than are white offenders” (p. 440). All prediction instruments use socioeconomic status variables such as employment, marital status, education, and residential stability that penalize members of minority group. Criminal history variables exaggerate differences between minority and white offenders and increase racial disparities.  “Increasing the severity of a sentence on the basis of risk prediction in effect punishes many offenders for crimes that would not have happened” (p. 440)., In some (largely US) sentencing systems, risk is explicitly a determinant of sentence severity.  In others, such as Canada’s, risk enters in subtler ways – in the purposes of sentencing and the use of criminal record in determining the sentence even though sentences are supposed to be proportional to the harm done.  But in addition, commercial risk instruments (see Criminological Highlights 17(2)#1, 17(6)#7) with serious limitations have become popular because they appear to be based on modern artificial intelligence principles and do not explicitly involve race or ethnicity as predictors., The dilemma is a stark one. Some people believe it is “irresponsible not to use state-of-the-art prediction methods” (p. 447). Others believe that offenders should be punished only for what they have done. Some people acknowledge that violence predictions are often inaccurate (just as some of  those exposed to an illness do not get it but are quarantined to prevent spread of the disease) but believe society is better served by being cautious and incarcerating those who might offend.  Those incarcerated people who would not have reoffended, however, are unlikely to accept that they are being treated justly,  especially since the predictions are often implicitly based on factors (e.g., age, race, gender, socioeconomic status) over which they have no or minimal control. Few disadvantaged people in any meaningful sense choose to be poorly educated, to lack work skills, or to have had unstable home lives., The use of a person’s criminal history to support a harsher sentence is typically justified by the assumption that those with extensive criminal histories are more likely to reoffend than are first offenders. The result, as others have noted, is that a person sentenced at one time for three offences (e.g., three burglaries) will be punished considerably more leniently than will a person who committed the same offences but is sentenced separately for each.  Proportionality is lost when criminal record enters the calculation. Scandinavian countries recognize this and typically acknowledge that a person should not be punished twice for the earlier offences. Moving away from the sometimes enormous weight given to criminal record in sentencing would almost certainly reduce (but not eliminate) disproportionate imprisonment rates for various groups (e.g., Blacks in the US; Indigenous people in Canada)., Conclusion: A sentencing system, or, more generally, a criminal justice system less based on prediction would, as a result, impose punishments based on the blameworthiness of the offender and the seriousness of the crime. It would also restore the idea that who the offender happens to be is less important than what the offender has done.  The challenge, however, is that “Prevention concerns and prevailing emotionalism may make elimination of preventive sentencing unachievable” (p. 474). On the other hand, it needs to be remembered that sentencing decisions in most civilized countries in the world are not normally based on predictions of future violence and many have low crime and imprisonment rates., Reference: Tonry, Michael (2019).  Predictions of Dangerousness in Sentencing: Déjà Vu All Over Again.  Crime and Justice: A Review of Research, 48, 439-482., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV18N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-18-no-4-%E2%80%93-march-2020,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 18, No. 4 – March 2020",Regular Issue,2020
The prediction tool used most frequently by British police forces in domestic violence cases to assess the risk for future domestic violence is found to have failed to give substantial assistance to police officers in identifying high-risk re-victimization or recidivism cases.,", “One of the most notable reforms on policing domestic abuse internationally has been the introduction of standardized risk assessment” (p. 1013).  The purpose in using these instruments, obviously, is to identify perpetrators who are likely to reoffend and to focus interventions (e.g., pretrial detention or special conditions of release) on them., Though logically such an approach makes sense, the success of such instruments has not been great. Although they may show statistically significant effects larger than chance, the overall accuracy of many of these measures is weak.  Said differently, there are many false negatives (recidivism that is not identified by the test) and false positives (people who are predicted to commit offences, but, in fact, do not).  A separate question, of course, is what these ‘objective’ tests should be compared to.  An earlier study (Criminological Highlights 3(2)#7) found that domestic violence victims were at least as accurate in predicting future violence as were the ‘objective’ measures., In this study, data from 41,570 intimate partner violence (IPV) incidents were examined in which a British standardized risk assessment tool – the Domestic Abuse, Stalking, and Honour Based Violence (DASH) form – was administered. Data from 19,510 non-IPV cases were also included in some analyses. DASH uses data from 27 questions that are asked of the victim and is described as a “structured professional judgement scale” in which final judgements are made either by a frontline officer or a police specialist, on the basis of the data collected by the officer.  Risks are described as high (victim at risk of serious harm), medium (serious harm unlikely unless the circumstances change) and standard (no evidence of the likelihood of serious future harm)., 5.6% of the original victims reported being revictimized by the same person within one year of the occurrence in which DASH data were collected.  For every 100 people who, in fact, were revictimized, about 6 were initially given a ‘high risk’ rating, 27 were given a medium risk rating, and 67 were given a ‘standard’ (low risk) rating.   Of those initially given “high risk” ratings, only about 10% actually reoffended.  This was a higher rate than those initially assessed as having a ‘standard’ risk where only about 5% reoffended.  But to say that ‘twice the percentage’ of high risk people reoffended in the ‘high risk’ group ignores the fact that 90% of this ‘high risk’ group did not reoffend., Even if the ‘medium risk’ people were considered ‘high risk’, it turns out that the instrument would only have identified about 33% of those who reoffended.  More dramatic is the fact that, using this cutoff of people predicted to reoffend (high and medium risk), only about 8% of those predicted to reoffend actually did.  Said differently, if coercive interventions had been used on all of those predicted to be “medium” or “high” likelihood of reoffending solely to stop reoffending, the intervention would not have been justified for 92% of the people., Other approaches – logistic regression and various machine learning methods – were used with the IPV and non-IPV data to see if more accurate predictions were possible using more sophisticated approaches. These more sophisticated approaches did not improve predictions, possibly because of unmeasured differences in the incidents (above and beyond the IPV/non-IPV distinction) or because of low reliability of the initial measures., Conclusion: This highly used prediction instrument clearly has relatively low validity – leading to high rates of false positives and false negatives in the prediction of intimate partner violence as well as other types of violence.   Hence the results underline the more general conclusion that the use of comprehensive measures (27 separate questions in this measure) or sophisticated looking measures (as in various high-tech approaches – see Criminological Highlights 17(2)#1, 17(6)#7) are unlikely to predict future violence adequately., Reference: Turner, Emily, Juanjo Medina, and Gavin Brown (2019).  Dashing Hopes?  The Predictive Accuracy of Domestic Abuse Risk Assessment by Police.  British Journal of Criminology, 59, 1013-1034., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV18N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-18-no-4-%E2%80%93-march-2020,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 18, No. 4 – March 2020",Regular Issue,2020
"Being arrested for a criminal offence increases youths’ likelihood of reoffending.  But this contact with the criminal justice system also increases youths’ measured risk of recidivism, furthering the likelihood, therefore, that they will in the future end up deeper in the youth justice system if “risk assessment” is applied to them.",", The measurement of criminogenic risk is now seen as “an integral evidence-based component of the criminal justice system” as if identifying and intervening to reduce criminogenic risk factors was uncontroversial.  “Proponents suggest that criminogenic risk assessment can improve sentencing procedures, facilitate jail diversion, reduce prison populations, help scale down mass incarceration, improve policing, reduce violence and correctional spending, increase resources for community development, and ultimately prevent crime altogether” (p. 478).  In other words, some people see risk prediction as contributing to solving many criminal justice problems., Risk assessment tools typically measure antisocial behavior, antisocial personality patterns, antisocial cognitions and antisocial associates.  Interventions – often imposed or applied as a result of risk assessment – traditionally attempt to lower one or more of these., The only problem, as has been shown elsewhere (e.g., Criminological Highlights 18(4)#3&#4), is that there are some risks of using risk assessments.  And these risks are not evenly distributed across those subjected to the assessments. Furthermore, “exposure to the criminal justice system [may increase] some of the risk factors used to predict recidivism and re-arrest; therefore, risk factors for recidivism and onset/duration of exposure to the criminal justice system are not interchangeable” (p. 480)., This study examines data from the Pittsburgh Youth Study involving boys entering Grade 1 in 1987-8.  It oversampled more troubled boys.  Measures of antisocial attitudes, behaviours, and the number of anti-social peers were obtained, as well as a host of control variables.   A variety of different statistical techniques were applied to the data to assess the impact of arrest and convictions., The data demonstrated that arrest significantly increased antisocial attitudes, antisocial behaviours (the frequency of minor, moderate, and serious delinquency) and the number of anti-social peers.  Conviction for an offence significantly increased antisocial attitudes and the number of anti-social peers, but had a less consistent effect on anti-social behaviours., The challenge that these data present is with the idea that the risk factors that are measured are simple “causes” of crime.  The risk factors measured when a youth is in custody are, at least partially, a result of the youth having been brought into the criminal justice system.  In simple words, then, the use of risk assessments can increase crime because those subject to them have criminogenic experiences imposed on them by the justice system.  Traditional risk assessments, then, “do not fully distinguish between individual-level propensities for criminal behavior and the criminalizing effects of the criminal justice system itself” (p. 484)., Conclusion: If a youth comes from a troubled neighbourhood, that youth may be more likely to be arrested than a youth from a more affluent neighbourhood.  The fact that the youth may have a higher ‘risk’ score would appear to suggest that more intrusive interventions might be warranted. This, however, ignores the fact that the higher risk score might, in fact, be the direct result of criminal justice interventions. The more intrusive intervention (arrest rather than release with a warning for example) is likely to increase ‘risk’ and subsequent offending.  Interventions, then, should be aimed at reducing the absolute number of people “flowing into criminological risk. Population prevention strategies, versus population management strategies, would aim to reduce first exposure to the criminal justice system, not merely to deploy criminogenic risk assessments during or after first exposure.” (p. 487)., Reference: Prins, Seth J.

"Judges, at sentencing, appear to revisit the decision to find an accused person guilty. They give harsher sentences in cases where the decision to find an accused guilty was based on stronger evidence.",", Sentencing is usually assumed to be largely determined by such factors as the seriousness of the offence(s) of conviction and the criminal record of the person being sentenced.  This paper suggests that the confidence the judge has in the appropriateness of the verdict also affects the severity of the sentence., The paper uses 484 case files completed between 2003 and 2006 in five American locations. The accused in these cases was convicted of a homicide offence, rape, robbery or aggravated assault and was sentenced to prison. (Only 2% received a non-prison sentence.)  The focus of the study was the weight of the evidence entered into the court proceedings and its relationship to sentence severity. Three separate measures of the strength of the evidence were employed: presence of a forensic lab report, the quantity of physical evidence, and presence of an eyewitness. 42% of the cases involved examination of one or more pieces of physical evidence in a crime lab.  57% of cases involved eyewitness evidence., Control variables included the offence (and whether, in cases other than homicide, it involved an injury to the victim), number of prior convictions,  whether the case was resolved by a  plea or a trial, sex and race of the defendant, sex and race of the victim, and court location., Above and beyond the control variables, cases in which there was a large amount of evidence against the accused and cases in which a forensic lab report was introduced by the prosecution were each associated with longer custodial sentences for the defendant. The presence of an eyewitness was unrelated to sentence severity., Perhaps a more ‘pure’ test of the idea that sentence lengths are longer in cases in which there is more convincing evidence comes from the 158 cases in which an accused was convicted at trial.  The results were substantially the same: harsher sentences were handed down in cases in which the conviction was apparently based on stronger evidence., It is possible, of course, that the weight of forensic evidence, itself, is dependent on law enforcement priorities and efforts. If that is the case, “the status characteristics of the parties to the offence actually produce specific types of evidentiary packages.  The degree of effort exerted by law enforcement to not only collect multiple types of physical evidence during their investigations but also to expend resources on forensic examination of some or all of that evidence may help explain certain of the sentencing disparities often directly attributed to the race and class of victims and offenders” (p. 381-2)., Conclusion: “These findings provide cause for concern because the type and quantity of the evidence used to establish elements of the crime at the point of conviction, especially in trial cases, should have little or no bearing on the severity of sentence imposed by judges, once offence severity is considered” (p. 381).  Nevertheless “when judges use evidentiary strength as a basis for their decisions in the sentence phase post trial, they are in effect revisiting the guilt-phase decisions of the trier of fact and are thus overstepping to evaluate the merit of the case after it has already been decided” (p. 381)., Reference: Nir, Esther and Elizabeth Griffiths (2018).

Judges and lawyers do not appear to understand issues related to the reliability and validity of expert psychological evidence offered in court and as a result are not good at deciding whether to admit or exclude this kind of evidence.,", In most jurisdictions, judges are expected to exclude from court expert testimony that is unreliable or invalid.  The problem is that “Although judges may make a good faith effort to distinguish between low- and high-quality expert testimony, they may lack the skills necessary to detect flaws in research” (p. 543).   In one survey of US state judges, only about half thought that they had the skills to do this kind of filtering of evidence., Most lawyers report that they routinely attempt to exclude expert evidence introduced by opposing counsel.  But arguments in court about admitting this evidence, or arguments to a judge or jury about the weight that it should be given, each assume that counsel can evaluate scientific evidence and communicate its strengths or weaknesses.  The situation becomes more problematic, obviously, for jurors when they are evaluating evidence since they may assume that, if the evidence is admitted, it must be reliable and valid., This study evaluated judges’, lawyers’, and ordinary people’s ability to evaluate the reliability of evidence and a crucial component of the validity of evidence – whether the expert could have biased the outcome of an intelligence test.  For a test to be reliable, it would normally be expected that the components of it would all be measuring the same thing and thus would be highly correlated, that the test, if repeated, would give essentially the same results, and that two testers would arrive at the same conclusion., 95 judges and 91 lawyers in the US were presented with a written version of a case that centred on the use of an intelligence test with a young person.  One group was told that the clinician administering the test knew that the young person’s IQ was expected to be low; the others were told that the person administering the test did not have any specific expectation of the result.  Some respondents were given indicators that the test was relatively unreliable; the others were given information suggesting that it was a highly reliable test.  Judges were asked whether they would exclude the evidence; lawyers were asked whether they would move to exclude the (opposing) evidence.  They were also asked to rate the scientific quality of evidence., Judges and lawyers indicated awareness of the issue of the importance of the validity of the evidence and they noticed the manipulation of the possible ‘expectation’ of the clinician administering the test.  Nevertheless, judges’ decisions on admitting the evidence was not influenced by the manipulations of validity and reliability. “The justifications that judges provided for their admissibility decisions suggest… that judges… will exclude evidence when they believe it is unreliable or invalid; the problem is that they cannot recognize when the evidence actually is unreliable or invalid” (p. 550).  But in addition, “variations in the validity of the testing conditions did not affect the likelihood that attorneys would move to exclude the expert’s testimony” (p. 551)., In a separate experiment, ordinary community members were presented with similar evidence (that varied in reliability and validity), with some of each group also hearing naïve or scientifically informed cross examination (from the opposing lawyer or from the judge). Jurors were apparently unaffected by the quality of the scientific evidence or the quality of the cross-examination of the expert., Conclusion: It would appear that judges, lawyers, and ordinary people have trouble dealing with issues of validity and reliability of expert psychological evidence.  The result is that assertions and ‘findings’ are accepted – or not – but the decision to accept the evidence does not seem to be highly responsive to the scientific quality of the evidence.  To the extent that legal cases depend on proper evaluation of scientific evidence by judges, lawyers, as well as jurors, it would appear that there is a need to address ways in which decision-making on scientific issues might be improved., Reference: Chorn, Jacqueline Austin and Margaret Bull Kovera (2019).

"A careful analysis of the effects of sex offender registration and notification (SORN) laws in Houston, Texas using data from a 35 year period finds that the original law, as well as changes which broadened its impact, had no overall impact on the incidence of sexual offences. Furthermore, the law had no apparent effect on four subsets of these offences/offenders: sexual assaults, sexual offences against children, first-time offenders, and repeat offenders.",", Quick fixes to crime problems are almost always popular.  One such ‘quick fix’ are sex offender registration and notification (SORN) laws.  These laws vary considerably and have been subject to a fair amount of research the results of which are consistent: they do not prevent sex offending (Criminological Highlights 5(6)#1, 7(4)#4, 8(6)#5, 9(2)#7, 10(3)#7, 11(4)#7, 11(6)#6, 12(5)#4, 14(5)#8, 18(1)#8))., However, these laws do vary. Hence it is worth examining whether a law – and changes to it – might have an impact in a local context, in this case Houston, Texas, the fourth largest city in the US.   The original Texas law was implemented in 1991, requiring all those then in custody (as well as those subsequently imprisoned) to register. In 1997, the law was extended, retroactively, to anyone convicted of a sex offence after 1970.  In 2005, it was extended to those living in Texas, but whose convictions were elsewhere., In this study, the impact of the original law (and changes to it) were examined for different outcome measures using monthly data on the number of charges filed for (a) all sexual offenses, (b) sexual offences involving first time offenders, (c) sexual offences involving repeat offenders, (d) sexual assaults, and (e) sexual offences against children.  As one way of ruling out effects that might not be caused by the implementation of SORN laws, changes in the number of non-sexual assaults were also examined.   Data were collected for 424 months starting on 1 January 1977 (before the first law came into effect) until 30 April 2012 (about 7 years after the last change)., Because there were sufficient observations both before the laws were first implemented and after the last set of changes, it was possible to use ‘interrupted time series’ analyses to examine the impact of the change in law. Various controls were included to eliminate both seasonal trends as well as overall trends across the full time period that were not related to changes in the law. Various models were examined, but the obvious expectation was that if the law was effective, it “should have an abrupt and permanent impact on sexual offence case filings as would each of the two subsequent modifications…” (p. 1502)., The results of the study are easy to summarize and are consistent with most of the existing research on SORN laws.  Texas’ SORN laws “generally reveal a lack of relationship between SORN laws and rates of all sexual offenses, or with specific measures of sexual assaults against adults, or sexual offences against children” (p. 1504).  Not surprisingly, most of the sexual offences that were reported were committed by those who had not been previously arrested for a sex offence that was subject to the state’s SORN requirements., Conclusion: “A growing number of studies suggest that the implementation of SORN requirements has had little relationship to the rates of sexual offending over time” (p. 1507).  These findings, combined with the knowledge that these laws have unintended (and additionally punitive) negative impacts on those who are subject to them, should lead those interested in reducing the incidence of these serious offences to consider other approaches., Reference: Bouffard, Jeff A. and LaQuana N.

"When the proportion of residents of Canada’s cities who are foreign born increases, crime generally decreases and when the proportion of foreign born goes down, crime goes up.","About 21% of Canada’s total population in 2011 were foreign born. But the origins of those immigrants are changing. Prior to 1971, about three quarters were from Europe, but now more are from Asia than elsewhere in the world.  This paper examines whether changes in the proportion of foreign-born people in Canada’s cities are associated with changes in crime rates., Theoretical arguments can be cited for expecting either that increased immigration would be associated with increases in crime (e.g., immigrants are often disadvantaged or face barriers in getting jobs; the increased heterogeneity associated with increased immigration may weaken informal social control) or decreases in crime (e.g., they may revitalize poor urban areas, or they may bring with them pro-social values that protect against criminal behavior)., This paper looks at crime rates in Canada’s 32 urban areas (populations greater than 100,000) as a function of changes in immigration as measured by the Statistics Canada census at 8 points in time between 1976 and 2011.  Immigrant populations are very unevenly distributed across Canadian cities.  In Toronto, for example, the proportion of the population that was foreign born increased from 35% in 1976 to 45% in 2011.  In contrast, in Saskatoon, between 1976 and 2001, the proportion of foreign born decreased from 14% to 7.5%., Immigration was assessed by combining two highly related measures: the portion of the population that was born outside of Canada and the proportion with a mother tongue other than one of Canada’s two official languages – English and French. Three different measures of crime were used – total (non-traffic) crime, property crime, and violent crime.  In all cases, Statistics Canada crime incident data were estimated for each metropolitan area as the average rate for the three-year period surrounding each of the census years., Fixed-effects linear regression models were used because the focus of the study was on within-city changes in crime and immigration.  This approach controls for within-city differences that are stable over time.   But in addition, various controls that do change over time within cities (e.g., percent home ownership, percent low income, labour force participation) were included in the model., The effect of changes in the main index of immigration (% foreign born and % mother tongue other than English/French) was quite consistent. Analysis of changes within cities demonstrated that after controlling for demographic and socio-economic factors, increases in immigration were associated with declines in total, property, and violent crime. Other analyses demonstrated that the overall pattern held both for cities where immigration increased and for cities in which the proportion of immigrants decreased: increased immigration was associated with decreased crime.  But in addition, decreasing immigration was associated with increases in crime.  These results are generally consistent with the findings from studies carried out elsewhere (see Criminological Highlights, 5(4)#6, 10(6)#7, 11(1)#4, 13(6)#7, 16(1)#2, 17(1)#3, 17(4)#1)., Conclusion: Canada’s overall crime rate in its cities dropped by an average of 52% between 1981 and 2011.  In this same 30-year period, the immigration index used in this study showed an increase of 250%.  The results of this study suggest that these changes are related: when immigration increased in a city, crime went down.  But similarly, when the proportion of immigrants declined, crime tended to increase.  Immigrants, it would seem, should be held responsible for lowering Canada’s crime rates., Reference:  Jung, Maria (2020).

"The popular explanation for mass shootings – that the assailant must have been mentally ill – not only isn’t very helpful in explaining or preventing these events, but also may undermine more productive approaches as well as harming those who already suffer the stigma of mental illness.",", When mass killings occur, there is often a search for evidence that the killer was mentally ill.  The US National Rifle Association, for example, suggests that these killings are caused by “mentally ill people who turn guns on innocents” (p. 86).  These explanations often have a circularity to them in that the explanation is typically offered because it is assumed that nobody but a mentally ill person would do such a thing., The proportion of violence in the US that could be attributable to mental illness is estimated to be under 5%.  Yet a 2016 study reported that 38% of US newspaper stories about mental illness over a 20-year period focused on violence. The problem is that “mental illness is a highly elastic clinical term that can mean many things but is often used without definition in the mass violence narrative” (p. 87).  Although people often agree, after a mass shooting episode, that there is a need for more mental health services, there is no evidence that such services would actually touch that tiny number of people most at risk for committing mass shootings. Similarly, there is no indication that laws that exist in some locations requiring ‘reporting’ of ‘dangerous patients’ (p. 87) have had any useful impact., The difficulty in the context of mass shooters, starts from a simple problem: Some estimates would suggest that about half of the US population will meet the formal criteria for one or more mental illnesses during their lifetime.  Hence, even taking “informal diagnoses of mental illness in the shadow of… shooting sprees” (p. 90) at face value, diagnoses of “mental illness” are not very useful in explaining why this person, and not the millions of others, acted the way they did.  Finding out that a person could possibly have been described as mentally ill is not much better than finding out that the person could possibly have been described as male. Simply put, even though there may be a small association between mental illness and ordinary violence, “most people with serious mental illness living in the community are not violent” (p. 91)., The most important challenge, however, is that mass violence is very rare.  And “the most robust risk factors for violence are shared by people with and without mental illness” (p. 93). These include being male, young, having a history of victimization and early exposure to violence, and having substance abuse problems.  Mass shootings where the shooter is psychotic do occur but are rare, and, again, most of those who suffer from symptoms of psychosis do not act violently., What if one sets these concerns aside and attributes mass shootings to mental illness?  Then, it would appear that two solutions follow -- fixing the mental health system and restricting the liberty of those with identified mental illness.  There are many good reasons for addressing the lack of treatment options for the mentally ill, but ‘fixing’ the system is a bit more difficult than fixing a flat tire on one’s automobile.  Restricting liberty for those diagnosed with a problem is also, from a practical perspective, impossible given that the number of people who would have to be incapacitated is enormous compared to the number of mass shooters.  Even restricting access to guns for those apparently suffering a mental illness is likely to be ineffective. One study suggests that it would reduce, at best, fewer than 5% of these incidents.  But restricting firearms more generally may be helpful in various ways: Firearms are likely to turn a non-lethal crime into a homicide and increases in gun availability also are associated with increased gun accidents (Criminological Highlights 17(3)#2, 17(4)#3)., Conclusion:  Stopping mass shootings by focusing on the mentally ill is almost certainly not an effective approach. Hence it is likely not only to stigmatize mental illness, but it discourages society from thinking more broadly about the problem.  This review of the evidence concludes that “improvements in the delivery of psychiatric services to people with serious mental illness will do little to prevent common violence, gun violence, or mass violence” (p 103)., Reference: Skeem, Jennifer and Edward Mulvey (2020).  What Role Does Serious Mental Illness Play in Mass Shootings, and How Should We Address It?  Criminology & Public Policy, 19, 85-108., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV18N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-18-no-5-%E2%80%93-june-2020,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 18, No. 5 – June 2020",Regular Issue,2020
"For white job applicants, having a criminal record reduces the likelihood of being hired. Equivalent black applicants, however, have a lower likelihood of getting the job than white applicants whether they have a criminal record or not.  But black applicants – whether or not they have a criminal record – are especially disadvantaged if the work establishment happens to be in a neighbourhood with an above-average rate of reported violence.",", There is now a substantial amount of information suggesting that people with criminal records face special challenges in getting employment, housing, and admission to college (e.g., Criminological Highlights 6(3)#2, 18(3)#6, 15(1)#7, 17(2)#6, 18(4)#2).  This paper extends this earlier research by looking at the impact of recent violence in the employer’s neighbourhood on the success of black and white job applicants who either volunteered the fact that they had a criminal record or apparently had no record., Specifically, the paper suggests that “for employers, any kind of recent exposure to proximate violent crime amplifies fears, activates stereotypes about blacks and criminals, and draws attention to information that reinforces stereotypes about blacks and criminality” (p. 71)., The design of the study was straightforward. A total of 368 résumés of hypothetical, but realistic, male job applicants were created and sent to those advertising, on the online service Craigslist, for food, beverage and hospitality industry jobs in Oakland, California, that required only a high school diploma.  The race of the applicant was manipulated by using names likely to be associated with white, black or Hispanic males.  Half of each group of applicants signaled that they had a criminal record by listing work in a correctional facility as the most recent employment experience., White and Hispanic job applicants without criminal records were most likely to be called back for job interviews or further investigation (38% and 39% respectively received callbacks).  For these groups, having a criminal record reduced substantially the likelihood of a callback (18% and 20%, respectively).  For black job applicants, however, the criminal record made no difference in part, perhaps, because the call-back rate was already low (16% for Black applicants without a criminal record and essentially the same, 18%, for those with a criminal record).   It would seem that being black or having a criminal record had dramatic effects in lowering the likelihood of getting a job., Violent crimes reported to the Oakland police were geocoded so that level of violence within 450 metres of the employment establishment in the 70 days prior to the job application being filed could be assessed.  For black applicants, with or without a criminal record, applying for a job with an employer whose neighbourhood was exposed to above average level of violence reduced the likelihood of a callback considerably.  White applicants (with or without criminal records) were slightly, but not statistically significantly, more likely to get a callback if they were applying in a high crime neighbourhood.    For Hispanic applicants, there were no consistent or significant effects of the level of neighbourhood crime., Another way of looking at these findings is that “race matters more for those employers who are exposed to higher, rather than lower, levels of violence” (p. 91).  The people least likely to get callbacks were black applicants who were applying for jobs in high violence areas., Conclusion:  Race and criminal record clearly have effects on the likelihood of obtaining employment.  But the effect of neighbourhood violent crime investigated in this paper – demonstrating that blacks are particularly disadvantaged when seeking employment in neighbourhoods with high violent crime rates – illustrates that the effects of local violence extend far beyond victims of crime. “This study provides new evidence of the extent to which perceptions of black men are intertwined with criminality” (p. 98)., Reference: Mobasseri, Sanaz (2019).  Race, Place, and Crime: How Violent Crime Events Affect Employment Discrimination.  American Journal of Sociology, 125(1), 63-104., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV18N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-18-no-5-%E2%80%93-june-2020,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 18, No. 5 – June 2020",Regular Issue,2020
Providing judges with risk assessments at sentencing increases the likelihood that poor defendants will be incarcerated but reduces the likelihood of incarceration for relatively affluent defendants.,", There are many empirical and policy reasons to question the appropriateness of ‘predictive’ models of sentencing (see Criminological Highlights 18(4) #3).  Risk has a tendency to worm its way into the sentencing process even in proportional sentencing systems.  In Canada, for example, a sentence is supposed to be proportional to the gravity of the offence and the responsibility of the offender for it, but its severity can be increased if the offender was, at the time of the offence, serving a sentence for a previous offence or separation from society is seen by the judge as ‘necessary’ (Criminal Code s.718.2(a)(vi); s. 718(c))., One worry about risk assessments at sentencing is that they will increase socioeconomic disparities in sentencing. The research question asked in this study is straightforward: Does the presence of a risk assessment at sentencing have the same impact on the sentence imposed on wealthy and poor defendants?, Judges in three regions of the US were asked, either at annual judicial conferences or online, to participate in a sentencing study involving them giving a “sentence” to a hypothetical person described in a printed vignette.  Having been assured anonymity, 85%-91% of those invited participated.  In two of the regions, risk assessments are routinely presented to judges at sentencing. The vignettes varied slightly so as to include relevant local details and risk assessment information that was similar to that which the judges normally saw., The defendant in these sentencing scenarios, having been convicted of being a participant in selling heroin,  was described either as working class (e.g., a casual labourer in construction who had not graduated from high school) or as middle class (e.g., having a BA in computer science and working in the local Apple store).    For half of each of these groups, the judge received no risk assessment information. The other half got detailed information about a risk assessment that had been carried out.  This assessment included the factors that went into the overall risk assessment such as criminal history, family problems and antisocial associates. It also included the ‘risk’ scores that the defendant received on each dimension.  The risk assessment information was identical for the relatively poor and relatively affluent defendant.   The overall risk score that each hypothetical defendant received was in the middle of the risk scale. Judges were then asked to indicate the sentence that they thought was appropriate., For middle class defendants, providing a risk assessment decreased the rate at which judges indicated they would imprison the defendant from 60% to 44%.  In contrast, for the relatively poor defendants, providing the risk assessment increased the imprisonment rate from 46% to 61%.  “Providing formal risk assessment information to judges reverses the relationship between a defendant’s socioeconomic status and sentencing severity…. This reversal held after controlling for judges’ jurisdictional and personal characteristics” (p. 56)., Conclusion: “Providing judges with risk assessment information transformed low socioeconomic status from a circumstance that reduced the likelihood of incarceration (perhaps by mitigating perceived blameworthiness) to a factor that increased the likelihood of incarceration (perhaps by increasing perceived risk)” (p. 56).  In other words, giving judges information that encouraged them to think about risk increased the likelihood that a poor person would be incarcerated.  But providing the same risk information about a middle-class person decreased the likelihood that the offender would be incarcerated. Focusing the judge’s attention on risk, then, disadvantaged the already disadvantaged defendant at sentencing., Reference: Skeem, Jennifer, Nicholas Scurich, and John Monahan (2020).  Impact of Risk Assessment on Judges’ Fairness in Sentencing Relatively Poor Defendants.

Suspending young people from school increases the likelihood that their friendship networks will change and that they will associate with antisocial peers.,", Previous research (see Criminological Highlights 16(6)#1) has found that being suspended from school increases the likelihood of being involved in crime.  This paper examines a possible mechanism for this finding -- that a suspended youths’ friendship networks are disrupted, and the suspended youth becomes more involved with youths who are committing offences., School suspensions appear to be concentrated among disadvantaged and racialized youths. It is also likely that being suspended means being separated from same-grade friends.  But in addition, youths who are suspended may be stigmatized (particularly in smaller communities or in local neighbourhoods) and may, as a result, be more likely to develop friendships with other youths who have engaged in some form of misbehavior., Changes in friendships in those suspended might be a cause of the suspension (youths get involved with other youths with behaviour problems and as a result are suspended). Alternatively, changes in friendship patterns may be a consequence of the suspension from school as suspended youths find new friends who, like themselves, are likely to be troublesome., In order to separate out these two explanations (suspensions cause changes in friendships vs. changes in friendships cause suspensions), this paper used data that followed two cohorts of  youths from the beginning of Grade 6 to the end of Grade 9, with data collected 5 times (beginning and end of Grade 6, and annually to the end of Grade 9).  That way it was possible to see if the change in friendship patterns preceded or followed the school suspension.  In addition, it provided a natural comparison group -- equivalent youths who were not suspended., The schools in which the research took place serviced relatively large rural areas in Iowa and Pennsylvania.  At each point in time, students were asked to name their two closest friends and up to 5 other close friends in their same grade and school. Suspension data were collected from self-reports from the students and their parents for the 12 months preceding each data collection. The main outcome variable was the within-individual change in nominations of friends made by each youth from one data collection to the next.  In addition, “rejections” as friends were measured as the number of nominations received in one wave that were not also received in the next wave of data collection.  Substance use (frequency of smoking, drinking alcohol, getting drunk, using marijuana) and delinquency measures (frequency of involvement in such behaviour as thefts, fighting and vandalism) were obtained for all youths for the previous year.  Approximately 30 control variables (many measured at each wave) were also collected., Suspended students had an increased likelihood of discontinuing a friendship they reported having in the previous data collection period.  This was particularly true of those suspended more than once.  In addition, being suspended made it more likely that a youth would lose a nomination as a friend compared to the previous wave.  In other words, being suspended increased the likelihood of a less stable friendship network: A suspended student was less likely than a non-suspended student to have the same friends as the previous year and less likely to be nominated as a friend in comparison to those who were not suspended.  Compared to non-suspended youths, suspended youths were more likely to nominate as friends those who were involved in substance use and offending., Conclusion:  Being suspended from school appears to disrupt friendship networks. But in addition, suspended youths are more likely to choose as friends those who are involved in substance use and delinquency.  Suspended youths were also more likely than those not suspended to have friends from other grades and other schools. Combined with data on other negative impacts of school suspensions (e.g., Criminological Highlights 18(3)#8), these findings suggest that the long term consequences of school suspensions should be considered by those endorsing it as a solution to troublesome behaviour., Reference: Jacobsen, Wade C.  (2020).  School Punishment and Interpersonal Exclusion: Rejection, Withdrawal, and Separation from Friends.  Criminology, 58, 35-69., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV18N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-18-no-5-%E2%80%93-june-2020,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 18, No. 5 – June 2020",Regular Issue,2020
The Psychopathy Check List (revised) and perhaps other “validated” personality assessment tools should not be used in circumstances where precise and accurate predictions of future behaviour are required concerning individual cases.,", The Psychopathy Check List – Revised (PCL-R) -- is sometimes described as the “gold standard” for assessing whether a person is likely, in the future, to engage in rule-breaking and troublemaking across settings., Some would suggest that the PCL-R is ‘accurate’ in its assessments of almost any population of people.  This paper, looking at its use for prisoners – most notably those facing the possibility of execution – suggests that it is inappropriate to use the PCL-R “to draw conclusions about an individual’s risk for committing serious violence in high-security custodial facilities” (p. 134)., The scale itself has 20 items. Standard administration involves a semi-structured interview by an expert and a review of relevant records to determine, on a three point scale, how much each characteristic (e.g., “glibness/superficial charm,” “lack of remorse of guilt,” “early behavioural problems,” p. 144) applies to an individual.  Hence although it is quantitative, subjective decisions have to be made (e.g. whether, on each dimension, the item does not apply, applies to a certain extent, or applies)., The PCL-R is often described as having high levels of agreement between raters (inter-rater reliability) for offenders and forensic psychiatric patients. However, recent research carried out by those not connected to the scale’s development suggests that examiners in adversarial settings tend to disagree with each other much more than would be expected on the basis of information in the test manual and that the scores tend to ‘drift’ substantially toward the position favoured by the party that hired the expert., More generally, when making predictions about a specific individual, the problem of variability across those experts administering the test is crucial.  Equally serious is the fact that the validity of the test – i.e, whether the test scores actually predict future behaviour – appears to vary across outcomes, settings, and samples. When trying to assess whether a particular forensic patient/prisoner is likely to commit offences in the future, the scale does not appear to provide predictions that are accurate enough to warrant depending on it when crucial decisions about an individual are being made., Conclusion: “The interrater reliability of PCL-R scores [the similarity of scores from two separate experts] in field settings, and in particular in adversarial contexts is problematically low. Second, the overall association between PCL-R scores and violence at the group level is only moderate in terms of effect size both in absolute terms and relative to the effect size of other established risk factors for violence; the association between PCL-R scores and violence in institutional settings is small … and the association between PCL-R scores and serious institutional violence is negligible” (p. 137).   These problems obviously support the conclusion that these scores should not be used in cases involving important decisions about an individual.  More generally, however, the analysis of the findings with respect to this particular test raise very similar questions about the reliability and validity of any personality or behaviour prediction test used in a forensic setting, not just for assessing risk for institutional violence., Reference: DeMatteo, David, Stephen D. Hart, Kirk Heilbrun and 10 others (2020).  Statement of Concerned Experts on the Use of the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised in Capital Sentencing to Assess Risk for Institutional Violence.

Giving judges another sentencing option to reduce the use of imprisonment won’t do anything unless the new option is well-designed and implemented sensibly. Canada’s “Conditional Sentence of Imprisonment” failed to reduce imprisonment because it didn’t follow these obvious rules.,", In the 1980s and 1990s, Canada’s imprisonment rate was creeping upwards.  In an explicit attempt to control this growth, the government introduced a new sanction: the conditional sentence of imprisonment that was supposed to be used, in some cases, as a substitute for ‘real’ imprisonment. Conditional sentences bear a striking resemblance to suspended sentences and probation. Judges were encouraged to impose this sanction in cases where imprisonment (of under 2 years) was appropriate but where having the sentence “served” in the community would not be a risk to public safety., There were many problems with the initial legislative drafting.  The law was written in such a way that it looked like the judge would first impose a sentence of imprisonment and then decide that it could be served in the community.  But the law also said that imprisonment shouldn’t be used if a sensible alternative that was proportionate to the offence seriousness could be crafted.  Furthermore, the legislation was written as if the non-custodial “conditional sentence” was to be of the same length as a prison sentence.  Judges were to impose conditions that made it equally punitive, though it was hard to see how that was possible.  The conditional sentence was often referred to as if it required “home arrest” (even by some academics) though house arrest has never been required.  And there were other technical problems in the initial law. For example, if a person on a conditional sentence simply disappeared, they automatically became a free person if they were not apprehended before the end of the sentence.  Not surprisingly, the sanction was seen as a ‘get out of jail free’ card.  And, of course, its name didn’t help.  It is called a ‘conditional sentence of imprisonment’ where people weren’t imprisoned (nor even required, in legislation, to imprison themselves in their own homes)., Though some have suggested that, notwithstanding these problems, the conditional sentence reduced the use of imprisonment, this paper suggests that various artifacts are more plausible explanations for the apparent reduction in the use of ordinary prison sentences that followed the introduction of the conditional sentence. For example, Canada experienced a large growth in the pretrial detention population at around the time when the conditional sentence became available.  Sentenced imprisonment rates decreased because of an increasing number of people who spent time in pretrial detention. They were given credit for time that they had already spent in prison awaiting trial.  Hence sentenced imprisonment rates decreased.  More generally, many of those who received conditional sentences almost certainly would have received a suspended sentence and probation if the conditional sentence choice was not available.   Said differently, the conditional sentence was more likely to be an “alternative to an alternative to imprisonment” than an alternative to imprisonment., The contrast with Canada’s successful reduction in the rate of imprisonment of youths (Criminological Highlights 18(3)#2) is clear.  Unlike Canada’s youth legislation, the conditional sentence’s legislation was ‘aspirational’ rather than prescriptive. Judges were given little legislative guidance on when it should be used.  They were only told what the limits of its use were.  The youth justice legislation was implemented in a manner that made its legislative intent and its operation clear.  The conditional sentence of imprisonment was simply dropped into Canada’s Criminal Code. Furthermore, unlike the substantial effort expended to educate judges and others about the new youth law, there was no systematic education of judges and others in the criminal justice system on what use to make of the conditional sentence., Conclusion: The more general lesson is that to be effective in reducing imprisonment, “there must be a demonstrable need for a new sanction, and even then, it is fundamental to identify what the specific need is and subsequently target the sanction to address it. Simply adding alternatives to incarceration is insufficient, particularly if they are crafted without sufficient guidance and training, as well as sensitivity to natural public concerns with leniency” (p. 196)., Reference: Webster, Cheryl Marie and Anthony N.

"In times when many prison systems are looking for people who can be safely released on parole in order to reduce prison populations because of COVID-19, those who have already been in prison for a reasonable length of time for murder are a good bet.",", The release from prison of people who have done very serious crimes is often controversial, even if they have spent a long time in prison.   Hence some jurisdictions do not allow murderers to be paroled, or, they create very long parole ineligibility periods., Ironically, those who have been convicted of murder appear to be some of the safest people to parole (see also Criminological Highlights 15(1)#2).  “Available data on recidivism… demonstrates that even though there may be a small number of convicted murderers who are forever dangerous to the community, the risk of violent and homicidal recidivism is minimal for the overwhelming majority” (p. 257).  The problem is a lot of publicity is directed at the very small number of cases where a person who has been convicted of a homicide offence and is then released commits another serious violent offence.   Successful cases, where a person serves time in prison for murder is released and never commits another offence, receive very little publicity.  This latter group, however, represents the vast majority of people convicted of murder and then released into the community., It is important to remember that, of those convicted of homicide who are eventually released on parole, most ‘failures’ on parole involve breaches of conditions.  Repeat murders are rare.  In one Australian study of 1088 homicide offenders released on parole, it was found that there was only one case where the person repeated the offence while on release (and this was a person who had a long history of violence from the time he was very young up until his imprisonment for murder at age 21). These results are similar to a New Zealand study that found no repeat murderers, but that 5% were, at some point after release, reconvicted for some violent offence.  A long-term follow-up of Canadian prisoners had similar results, with fewer than 1% repeat murders and a low rate (9.2%) of any type of subsequent indictable offence. A study of those prisoners released from mandatory life sentences in England & Wales found only 2.2% reoffended in any way, compared to a repeat offending rate of 46.7% of those in the general prison population., Retrospective studies that have been carried out on those who have been convicted of a homicide offence have similar results. In Finland, for example, a study of 1,649 homicides that occurred between 1981 and 1993 found that only 36 (2.2%) were committed by those with a previous homicide offence.  Notably, however, 24 of the offenders were alcoholics and 23 had a personality disorder., US studies show the same pattern:  relatively low rates of repeat violence and very small numbers of repeat murders. When capital punishment was (temporarily) found unconstitutional in the US, a number of those who were imprisoned awaiting execution were released into the community. In a follow-up of at least 5 years after release, only one of 239 people who were followed committed a subsequent homicide., Conclusion:  It is clear from studies carried out in many western countries that people in the community who once committed murder are not a large source of violent offending in any country.  More generally, “the risk of any form of violent and homicidal recidivism in this distinctive group of offenders is very low” (p. 265).  The argument either for “life without parole” or impossibly long parole ineligibility periods (e.g., the consecutive parole ineligibility periods now available in Canada for those convicted of two or more murders) cannot be made on the basis of sensible use of public funds for public safety., Reference: Anderson, John L.

"The over-representation of Indigenous people in the criminal justice system is a serious concern in many countries.  Focusing on Australian youths, this paper demonstrates that the criminal justice component of this problem starts with police decisions on whether to charge or divert youths who are apprehended for offences.","When the police apprehend youths, they often decide, especially for those who are apparently being apprehended for the first time, that the youth should be diverted.  This is typically a decision made without publicity and is typically not reviewable.  This paper examines whether youths apprehended for the first time in New South Wales (Australia) and who are eligible for diversion from the formal justice system are less likely to be diverted if they are Indigenous., Data on 53,632 cases were examined in which a young person was apprehended for an offence for the first time.  The legislation in place at the end of the data collection period was designed to “provide an alternative process to court proceedings for dealing with children who commit certain offences…” (p. 1072).  But in addition, the legislation explicitly aimed to “address the over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in the criminal justice system” (p. 1072).  The alternatives available to the police instead of a court summons included a caution, warning, or youth conference., Various factors were controlled in the analysis including age, sex, total number of charges, and the number of violent charges.  Overall, 85% of these youths (who were apprehended for the first time) were diverted from the formal system.  Overall, non-Indigenous youths were more likely to be diverted (87%) than were Indigenous youths (77%).  This effect remained in analyses that included the various control factors. Not surprisingly, males, those with many charges and/or many violent charges were more likely to be sent to court.  Indigenous youths were more likely to have a greater number of charges involving violence.  However, the difference in the likelihood of being sent to court for Indigenous and non-Indigenous youths held for those with 0, 1, 2, or 3 or more charges of violence.  The change in the law that took place during the study – adopting the explicit encouragement of diversion -- did make a difference: fewer youths were charged after the new law came into effect.  But Indigenous youths were disadvantaged in both time periods, though the size of the effect size appears to be less after the change in the law., One possible explanation for the differential treatment of Indigenous vs. non-Indigenous youths is that there may be fewer diversionary options in rural or remote areas of the state.  If this were the case, it likely reflects a state decision about the allocation of resources.  Alternatively, the effect could reflect “perceptions of increased criminogenic risk [that] may influence police decisions to formally process Indigenous youth” or “the often documented historically poor relationship between police and Indigenous communities” (p. 1081).  These explanations are not mutually exclusive., Conclusion:  This study looks at a crucial step in the criminalization of a disproportionate number of Indigenous youths.  By looking at police decision-making about youths coming into contact with the justice system for the first time, the idea that the over-representation of Indigenous youths in the justice system is due solely to differential rates of offending is eliminated as an explanation.  Whatever the offending rates of Indigenous and non-Indigenous youths may be, these data make it clear that at their first contact with the youth justice system, Indigenous youths are more likely to be treated formally rather than diverted., Reference: Papalia, Nina and 5 others (2019).  Disparities in Criminal Justice System Responses to First-Time Juvenile Offenders According to Indigenous Status.

"Gentrification in urban neighbourhoods may not have a consistent impact on the nature of policing in those neighbourhoods, but gentrification does appear to increase police stops in adjacent neighbourhoods not undergoing gentrification.",", Using a variety of data from New York City, this study investigates the effect of gentrification and neighbourhood change on policing practices not only in the neighbourhood experiencing gentrification but also in adjacent neighbourhoods., One of the more controversial forms of policing involves proactive police stops of citizens who are not apparently committing offences (see the Criminological Highlights collection Understanding the Impact of Police Stops). This type of policing represents “a more general shift away from the social tolerance of deviance or difference toward a more punitive approach…” (p. 902).  This form of “order maintenance policing” might be expected to vary within a city according to the spatial distribution of gentrification., Gentrification, in this study, was defined by an index including indicators such as changes in the percent of the population with at least a bachelor’s degree and in the percent involved in various “professions” (education, science, health, management, etc.).  Citizen demand for order maintenance policing was measured by the number of calls to the city directed to the police to deal with neighbourhood problems (e.g., public drinking, noise, skateboarding on the sidewalk).  The main dependent variable was the per capita intensity of street-level police stops that occurred under the city’s “stop, question, and frisk” policing program.  Census tracts were defined as ‘eligible’ to gentrify if, in the year 2000, they had at least 500 residents who generally had low income and rents in the neighbourhood were generally low. Gentrified or gentrifying tracts were those where rent and the gentrification index (education, occupation) were high or increasing between 2000 and 2014., The challenge, when trying to understand the distribution of police stops, is to separate out the effects of gentrification from the effects of race, class, demands for police services, and crime levels.  This was accomplished by using a specific technique (spatial Durbin models) that can control for these other effects while simultaneously looking at the impact of change on adjacent tracts as well., There was a small, and not very consistent, impact of gentrification on police stops in the location that was being gentrified during this period (2000-2014).  However, there was a large and consistent impact of gentrification of a census tract on the rate of police stops in nearby locations:  police stops in neighbourhoods adjacent to gentrifying neighbourhoods increased dramatically as the neighbourhood became gentrified.  These effects did not appear to be consistently associated with the number of calls from citizens to the police. Hence it did not appear that people in neighbourhoods adjacent to gentrifying neighbourhoods were requesting police involvement., Conclusion: The most dramatic impacts of gentrification of New York neighbourhoods were indirect:  Gentrification in a tract does not necessarily lead to consistently increased numbers of police stops in the gentrifying neighbourhood. Instead, the effects are felt most clearly in adjacent or neighbouring areas.  “Gentrifying in-movers likely do not prefer to see heavy and frequent policing in their neighbourhoods any more than they prefer to see signs of ‘disorder’ as it sends negative signals about their neighbourhoods, specifically about crime.  The dislocation of policing from these changing neighbourhoods to adjacent neighbourhoods would be consistent with those preferences” (p. 920-3)., Reference: Laniyonu, Ayobami (2018).

Being suspended from school increases the likelihood that youths will commit offences and “may fundamentally alter [their] trajectories of offending across time” (p. 753).,", Previous research has found that being suspended from school can have serious negative impacts on youths.  Those who have been suspended appear to be more likely both to be arrested and to commit certain violent offences.  And, not surprisingly, school suspensions change the group of friends a youth has and increase the likelihood that a youth will have friends who commit offences and use illegal substances., One of the limitations of previous research is that it doesn’t look at within-individual change in offending as a function of being suspended.  Instead the research tends to compare the rate of offending by those who are suspended and rate of offending of similar youths who were not suspended.  One problem, then, is whether increased offending is the result of the suspension or whether youths who offend are more likely to be suspended.  By looking at ‘within individual’ change and offending by youths who were and were not suspended, this study can unravel, in a more satisfactory manner, the direction of the causal relationship between suspension and offending., This study uses data on youths age 12-18 who participated in a large US longitudinal study. It uses four annual waves of data (from 1997 to 2000). The measure of offending combined the frequency and the severity of self-reports of attacks/assaults, carrying a firearm, selling illegal substances, destroying property and theft.   Youths were asked whether they had been suspended from school since the previous interview (or in the past year, in the case of the first wave of data collection).  Various control measures were included such as whether the youth was a member of a gang, whether the youth had delinquent friends, the youth’s attachment to the family, and family income., Because only some youths had been suspended (about 26% were suspended at least once), and because it was possible, from the second wave of data collection onwards, to control for the youth’s circumstances in the previous year (including whether they had been suspended prior to the most recent year), it was possible to look at changes in behaviour across time, while controlling both for ‘within group’ changes and for differences across youths who were and were not suspended., The results are easy to describe:  Controlling for differences that existed prior to the most recent year, being suspended in the 12-month period immediately prior to a data collection point increased the youth’s involvement in delinquent behaviour.  But in addition, the more times the youth had been suspended the larger the increase in the level of delinquent behaviour.  That increase existed even when levels of prior offending were controlled for. “Prior work has demonstrated strong racial and ethnic inequalities in the use of suspensions…. Specifically, [US] studies have shown that Black and Hispanic youth are far more likely to receive suspensions than their  White counterparts… [thus suggesting] that the effects of punitive school discipline may exacerbate difference in offending across racial/ethnic groups over time” (p. 753)., Conclusion: It has been suggested that “most [school] administrators turn to school exclusion as a disciplinary tool because they need to do something and don’t know what else to do” (p. 754).  However, this paper suggests that “school suspensions appear to increase offending within individuals across time and present a cumulative effect on offending between-individuals.” (p. 752).  In other words, although school suspensions may provide a simple (or simplistic) solution to disciplinary problems within the school, they may simply be shifting the location of where these problems can be found from the school to the community more generally., Reference: Mowen, Thomas J., John J. Brent, and John H.

"Youths aged 6 to 16 who were described by their school classmates as being aggressive were more likely than other youths to be charged with criminal offences as adults (age 18-49). However, if a youth managed to achieve high levels of education, the effect of their early childhood aggressiveness was eliminated.",", Aggressive behaviour in childhood is associated with increased likelihood of committing crimes later in life.  But in addition, aggression may be affecting other aspects of the child’s life such as educational attainment.  But educational attainment, itself, is associated with other risk factors such as neighbourhood disadvantage.  This paper attempts to disentangle the role of these factors by looking at the effects of education on the trajectory from childhood risk to adult offending., The study uses longitudinal data from French-speaking children who participated in a longitudinal study in Montreal, Quebec.  The study began in 1976 with children who were in grades 1, 4, and 7. They were followed until 2010.  It was hypothesized that neighbourhood disadvantage would be associated with childhood aggression and educational achievement, and that these three factors would be associated with later criminal behaviour. In addition, it was hypothesized that high educational achievement would reduce the negative impact of childhood aggressiveness and neighbourhood disadvantage., In 1976-78, children in grades 1,4, and 7 were asked to identify classmates whom they thought were aggressive. Educational achievement records for these children were obtained from the Ministry of Education.  Criminal charges (for violence, property and drugs) were obtained from court records for the youth from age 18 into middle-adulthood (age 38-49).   Separate analyses were carried out for males and females., Not surprisingly, neighbourhood disadvantage and childhood aggression were each associated with fewer total years of education.  Childhood aggression was also associated, for males and females, with higher rates of violent, property and drug charges.  But higher levels of educational achievement were independently associated with reduced rates of criminal charges for both sexes., The finding that is, perhaps, most interesting is that if the child achieved high levels of education (one standard deviation above the mean) there was essentially no difference in adult criminal charges for people who had been high or low aggression youths.  This held true for charges against both sexes for property and drug charges and for violent charges for males only.   In other words, if the child managed to achieve high levels of education, the deficits from being highly aggressive disappeared., Conclusion: “Children who are highly aggressive will be more likely to have fewer years of education but may have lower probabilities of criminal offending if they continue in school despite this risk. It may be that education can be protective for children who are aggressive, if they can be provided with resources for dealing with these early behavioural risks” (p 552). These findings suggest that, in studying the development of criminal offending, “education should not be overlooked or used simply as a control variable: it may have a mediating or protective effect on the relations between risk variables and criminal outcome….”  (p. 554). Hence “strengthening schools and programs in disadvantaged neighbourhoods and targeting children with behavioural problems within these at-risk populations are essential elements in a prevention strategy” (p. 554)., Reference: Kennedy-Turner, Kathleen and five others (2020).

Increasing the presence of police acting as “school resource officers” does not improve public safety but does increase both the number of youths charged for certain drug and weapon offences and the number of youths excluded from regular classrooms for disciplinary reasons.,", In many parts of the US, the use of school resource officers (SROs) – sworn police officers placed in schools as part of a “community policing” initiative – has increased dramatically, particularly in secondary schools.  A recent study found that 84% of secondary schools with enrollments of over 1000 had SROs assigned to them., The use of SROs is controversial.  Those who favour their use suggest that not only do SROs increase safety through surveillance and enforcement, but SROs also develop strong bonds with students encouraging information sharing about security threats.  Critics question the value of SROs for public safety, suggesting that their presence encourages punitive criminal justice responses to problems that would otherwise have been handled by the schools., This study examined the impact of increased use of SROs in 33 schools in California that occurred because of new funding.  The increase was from an average of 13 hours of SRO presence per week prior to the implementation of new funding to 20 hours per week.  These schools were compared to 72 schools that did not receive additional SRO support and, in the same period, showed little change in the number of hours of SRO presence in the school (11 hours per week).   The impact of this increased SRO presence in schools was measured 11 and 20 months after the increase., Various control measures were taken into account.  These included the number of security practices in place in the schools during the study, the number of prevention programs related to school safety, the number of non-SRO law enforcement officers in the schools, and the concentration of other security personnel., For students described as having ‘special needs’ there was no impact of the increased concentration of SROs on recorded weapons and drug related offences.  For students without special needs, however, there was an increase in the recorded number of these offences in the schools with increased SRO concentration.  During this same time period, there was no change in the comparison schools (in which SRO presence did not change).  The change in disciplinary actions for non-special needs students suggests that the impact of the increased presence of SROs was, relative to the comparison schools, to increase the use of disciplinary actions.  Disciplinary actions were defined as an action that removed the student from their regular classroom setting for one or more days., SROs were more likely than school administrators to endorse punishment-oriented approaches to school problems rather than prevention-oriented approaches. Thus, in comparison with school administrators, SROs, when questioned, were more likely to agree with statements such as “Schools cannot afford to tolerate students who disrupt the learning environment” and were less likely to agree with statements such as “Suspension is unnecessary if we provide a school climate and challenging instruction” (p. 921)., Conclusion: For students without special needs, “as the amount of time allocated to law enforcement activities increased [by the police officers in the schools], so did the counts of all types of offences except property offences” (p. 927).  The primary goal of having additional police in the schools, according to the National Association of School Resource Officers, is to make schools and children safer and not to increase the use of formal (e.g., court) discipline.  However, prior research suggests that increased police in schools leads to higher levels of arrest and referral of students to law enforcement. This study adds to these findings by demonstrating that increased presence of police officers in schools leads to increased use of exclusionary responses by the schools, an effect that clearly can have negative impacts on youths (see Criminological Highlights 18(6)#3)., Reference: Gottfredson, Denise C.  and 6 others (2020).

"Immigrants to the US are not only less likely to commit offences than native-born Americans, but, if they do commit offences, they are less likely than equivalent native-born Americans to re-offend.",", Previous research (see Criminological Highlights, 18(5)#1, 5(4)#6, 10(6)#7, 11(1)#4, 13(6)#7, 16(1)#2, 17(1)#3, 17(4)#1) has made it clear that compared to native-born residents, immigrants in the US and Canada are less likely to commit criminal offences.  This paper goes one step further and examines whether, after committing offences and being imprisoned, immigrants and native-borns differ in the likelihood that they will commit further offences after they are released., It is well established that “prisoner reentry is a particularly difficult transition for those returning to society” (p. 438).  It would be plausible to find that prisoner re-entry might be more difficult for immigrants because they are less integrated into the dominant society or because they may lose touch with those (few) people who might be supportive of them.  On the other hand, there are data suggesting that compared to native-born residents (of the US), immigrants are, in general, more likely to be employed and married, both of which may make it easier for them to reintegrate peacefully into society. In addition, after release, immigrants may be returning to a community with strong social bonds. Hence it is difficult to form a strong hypothesis about recidivism rates of immigrants vs. native-born people after release from prison., This study examines the reoffending of 192,556 people (2% of whom were foreign-born) released from Florida prisons between 2004 and 2011.  It does not include those who were released to a non-Florida location (since they couldn’t be easily tracked) nor does it include those who were deported or transferred to US immigration authorities. It only examines new crimes rather than supervision offences.  The main dependent variable was whether the person reoffended in the three years following release. Various other factors were statistically controlled.  These included age, sex, education, marital status, previous employment, various measures of prior record and prison commitments, the offence(s) related to the current sentence, and supervision violations., Two approaches were used to ‘control for’ irrelevant differences between native- and foreign-born people. First, these control variables were included in a logistic regression predicting recidivism.  Controlling for 25 other factors, those who were foreign-born were significantly less likely to reoffend.  The second approach – propensity score matching – compares “foreign- and native-born ex-offenders who are statistically equivalent across all covariates [control variables] included in the analysis” (p. 446)., The results are very simple.  In each analysis, foreign-born former prisoners were less likely to reoffend than were native-born people released from prison.  Without controlling for other differences between the groups, 19% of the foreign-born were convicted of a felony offence within three years of release, compared to 32% of native-born.  When controls for the differences between native- and foreign-born former prisoners were included in the analysis using logistic regression, the odds of recidivism within three years of release were over 20% lower for foreign-born ex-prisoners than for native-born former prisoners.   The propensity score matching technique has the advantage of using a subset of prisoners (n=7,510) who were almost exactly matched on the control variables, thus avoiding the possibility that an effect could be explained by the possibility that the ‘worst’ of the foreign-born prisoners had been deported (out of the country and therefore out of the study).  The results were almost exactly the same: Foreign-born ex-prisoners had lower re-offending rates than native-born ex-prisoners., Obviously, what is not known is why immigrants are less likely to re-offend than comparable native-born former prisoners and whether the mechanisms that account for these findings are the same as might account for the earlier findings (that immigrants, generally, are less likely to commit offences than native-born people)., Conclusion:  Previous research has demonstrated that immigrants are less likely than native-born residents to commit criminal offences.  The data are consistent across different definitions of immigrants, different measures of offending, and different countries.  This study extends these findings by showing that foreign-born residents released from prison are also less likely to re-offend than native-born residents., Reference: Ramos, Javier and Marin R.

The Canadian public would be likely to be more supportive of granting pardons to those convicted of sex offences if the public knew that people convicted of sex offences were not likely to commit another sex offence.,", Canada, like many jurisdictions, has a system in place by which adults who are convicted of criminal offences can have their criminal records suppressed so that they no longer have to live with the negative consequences of a criminal record.  This paper suggests that providing ordinary citizens with small bits of information that are relevant to the issue of pardons may make the granting of a pardon for a criminal offence more acceptable., Canada has had a system of allowing people to have their criminal records effectively eliminated since the early 1970s.  The advantages of such a system for those who have offended and for society more generally are summarized elsewhere – see the Criminological Highlights collection Evaluating the Benefits of Pardons: An Overview of Criminological Highlights Summaries of Research Related to Pardons., In Canada, the ‘pardon legislation’ has been, in recent years, politicized and thus the level of public support is relevant to understanding why governments, since the availability of pardons was restricted, have not been motivated to make changes.  This paper examines the importance of public knowledge in determining support for this part of the justice system., One of the more contested aspects of Canada’s pardon system is the granting of pardons for sexual offences.  Many people apparently believe that the likelihood of reoffending for those who have been convicted of sexual offences is very high – and, importantly, higher than it is for other offences even though the evidence does not support this conclusion (see the Criminological Highlights collection Some Recent Research on Sex Offenders and Society’s Responses to Them.)., In this paper, ordinary Canadians, approached in public places, took part in an experiment embedded in a survey.   Half of the respondents were asked a simple question about pardons for those convicted of sex offences: “Should people convicted of sexual offences be allowed to apply for pardons?”  The other half were asked this same question but after being given an introduction explaining to them that reoffending rates for sex offenders are no higher than for other offenders and that typically, if they do reoffend, it does not involve a sex offence.   Those who received the information about sex offending were significantly more favourable to the idea of allowing those convicted of sex offences to apply for pardons., A detailed analysis of the findings suggested that the information about re-offending by those once convicted of sex offences tended to reduce, most dramatically, the proportion of those strongly opposed to pardons for this group. The single 35-word statement reduced the proportion of those strongly opposed to pardons for sex offenders from 46% to 30%.  Women in the sample, were, compared to men, more strongly opposed to allowing pardons for those convicted of sex offences. Not surprisingly, those who generally supported the pardon system favoured allowing those convicted of sex offences to apply., Conclusion:  Canada’s pardon system, in the past decade or so, has been made increasingly difficult to access.  Fees have increased from $50 to $631.  Waiting times have increased from 3 or 5 years to 5 or 10 years. And many people have been made ineligible for pardons.  The findings from this study suggest that public support for pardons can – at least in some ways – be increased if the government were to provide very basic information about pardons, one of its more successful criminal justice programs., Reference: Murphy, Yoko (2020).

"Those once convicted of criminal offences in Canada – even if they were subsequently exonerated – will have difficulty finding rental housing.  If the person looking for housing is Indigenous, they are even less likely to be able to get rental housing.",", Contact with the criminal justice system has been shown to have various negative effects that it is in society’s interest to attempt to minimize (see, for example, Criminological Highlights collections on The Effects of Imprisonment: Specific Deterrence and Collateral Effects and Evaluating the Benefits of Pardons). This paper examines one of the challenges – obtaining rental housing -- for those with criminal records as well as those first convicted and then exonerated., The hypothesis was that even if a person is demonstrated to have been wrongfully convicted, the contact with the criminal justice system itself will still be stigmatizing.  The problem, of course, is exacerbated in the case of Black and Indigenous people who are likely to be discriminated against in fundamental areas such as obtaining housing., In this study, a total of 1107 online advertisements for one-bedroom apartments in cities across Canada were identified.  Apartments advertised by property management or real estate companies were excluded because many such organizations routinely respond to all advertisements.   The researchers composed email inquiries asking whether the apartment was still available.  The email indicated that the applicant had a job and had the money for first and last months’ rent.   The applicant identified himself using a name that had been pretested and shown to identify the applicant as probably being a Black person (Tyronne Lewis), an Indigenous person (Dowanhowee Musquash) or a white person (Matthew Smith).   In the email application, one third of each group either indicated nothing about a criminal justice background. Another third of the applications said that the applicant had “a criminal record… did something stupid… served my time.” The final group said that the applicant “had a criminal record… was wrongfully convicted… and DNA has exonerated me” (p. 304).  Landlords were randomly assigned to one of the nine conditions (3 race/ethnicity groups by 3 types of criminal background)., The main outcome measure was whether the landlord replied indicating that the apartment was still available (as contrasted with not replying at all or responding that it was not available).  In the ‘control’ condition (no mention of criminal justice involvement) 68% of the inquiries resulted in the landlord indicating that the apartment was available.   Only 27% of those with an ordinary criminal record were told by their potential Canadian landlord that the apartment was available.  Interestingly, even fewer (18%) of those who said that they had a criminal record but had been exonerated were offered an opportunity to look at the apartment.  The pattern of the effects was similar across the three race/ethnicity groups.  However, there was an overall effect of race in that Indigenous applicants were less likely to receive a positive response from landlords than White applicants (33% positive replies for Indigenous applicants vs. 42% positive replies for White applicant).  Black applicants were between these two groups (39%) and were not significantly different from either.  The basic finding on criminal record was replicated in a second experiment carried out only in Toronto., Conclusion:  Admitting to having a criminal record, even when also reporting that one has been exonerated, makes it dramatically less likely that one will be able to rent an ordinary apartment.  But there is an added disadvantage for those whose names would indicate that they might be Indigenous.

"The mandatory reporting of suspicions of child abuse or neglect to government authorities is meant to protect children and prevent abuse.  Mandatory reporting requirements, however, can have negative impacts on innocent parents, including survivors of intimate partner violence, and their children. This is especially the case for trans and gender non-conforming survivors as well as racialized survivors.","The first of these two papers highlights that when survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) turn to public systems for support “often as a last resort to protect their children… they necessarily submit to the scrutiny of staff who are required to report suspicions of child abuse or neglect to the state child protective system” (p. 217).  In Ontario, for example, under the Child, Youth and Family Services Act (s. 125) any person who suspects that a child is at risk of physical or sexual harm must report it to appropriate authorities. Such laws are the norm in many jurisdictions., The problem is that exposure to IPV can be deemed to be abuse.  Similarly, “poverty can be easily (mis)interpreted as neglect” (p. 219) as the poor may not have sufficient food, shelter, or other resources. Being poor, then, puts people at risk of being reported as neglecting their children.  “Ideally poverty-related neglect would result in increased services and supports… [but sometimes a mother’s] poverty is effectively criminalized as maltreatment” (p. 220). This may be especially likely in racialized families., The second of these two papers examines the intersection of mandatory reporting laws and IPV with data from IPV survivors who were seeking support on a telephone IPV hotline. Though obviously they cannot be assumed to be a representative group of IPV survivors, the results illustrate some of the problems with mandatory reporting of suspicions of childhood risk or neglect., Many (35%) of the respondents indicated that they had avoided asking for help from at least one person because of a fear that the information would be reported.  Often the person they did not seek help from for this reason was a family member or friend.  Often the fear was that the partner would be arrested, making things worse and/or leading to increased poverty.  IPV survivors also feared that reporting would lead to child protective services involvement, resulting in the survivors’ children being taken away from them., About 15% of the callers – especially multi-racial survivors - indicated that, while seeking help, they were warned that what they say might have to be reported to authorities. Often this warning came from a medical or mental health provider or a family member or friend.  For 61% of the participants who were warned, the result was that they changed what they had planned on sharing – including withholding of information or misrepresenting their experiences. For some, the warning led them to stop seeking help.  As one IPV survivor put it: “I talk to no one, there’s no one I can trust, no one I can turn to and nowhere I can go” (p. 262)., The idea behind mandatory reporting is, presumably, that there will be benefit to the survivor if the IPV and related matters get reported to authorities.  From the survivor’s perspective, however this was not the case.   Most survivors said that the impact of a mandatory report was to make their situation “much worse” (51%) or a little worse (12%).  Only 17% indicated that reporting made things better, with the remaining 20% saying that it didn’t change things., Conclusion: Mandatory reporting laws create barriers for intimate partner violence survivors who are seeking supports.  In particular, survivors appear to fear people in their informal networks. For those who did report their experiences, the report “worsened their situation, often by involving them in systems they deemed unhelpful at best and harmful at worst” (p. 265).  Among the harmful impacts of mandatory reporting, particularly for racialized women, was the removal of children from the home of the intimate partner violence survivor., Reference: Goodman, Lisa A. and Jennifer E.

"The reality of why rape victims report their experiences to the police is more complicated than the dominant public narratives about reporting – that victims are simply seeking retributive justice. By ignoring the victims’ actual aspirations, it is inevitable that there will often be a large gap between the aspirations of the victim who reports and the reality of the justice system’s response.",", Studies have typically found that the rates at which women report rapes and other sexual assaults to the police are low.  At the same time, “the enduring research and policy preoccupation with the problem of underreporting to the police appears to have obscured the question of why victim-survivors do report” (p. 176)., This paper examines the accounts and experiences of a small (n=24) sample of Scottish women who did report their victimizations to the police. In many cases, friends, relatives, or others were critical in the decision to report the rape to the police. In trying to understand why women reported their victimizations, the most important finding is that there was no simple dominant reason. “While some participants’ reasons for reporting were underpinned by their need for the criminal justice system to provide safety and protection, for others, reporting to the police represented a way of validating their experience and acknowledging the harm that they had suffered” (p. 182)., For many, it was important that the perpetrator be held accountable for the harm he had inflicted. Similarly, victims felt it was important that he not get away with what he had done. At the same time, “perpetrator-oriented reasons were not always punitive….  The retributive aspects of these reasons [for reporting] were largely underpinned by a desire for the attacker to be publicly exposed and held accountable rather than to encounter pain and punishment” (p. 184).   Other victims described their reasons for reporting in terms of broader social responsibility: to exert control and attempt to reduce victimization. For some, it was simply the “right thing to do” for various reasons including to prevent the perpetrator from repeating his crimes.  Not surprisingly, “marked differences were observed in the aspirations and determination associated with reporting between women who had experienced rape or sexual assault as part of historical, long term, or domestic abuse compared with women who had experienced recent assaults perpetrated by someone less intimately known to them” (p 188)., “The findings indicate that women largely report [rape] to protect other women and due to a moral obligation to ‘do the right thing’ or ‘take a stand’ against sexual violence” (p. 189). But this leads to what might be called an “aspiration-reality” gap which “reflects the likely discord experienced by victim-survivors between their expectations and the reality of criminal justice processes and outcomes, and between their aspiration to validate their experiences and protect others by ‘doing the right thing’ and the ability of the criminal justice system to respond in kind” (p. 189)., Conclusion:  The data from interviews with victim-survivors of rape suggest they “are likely to experience an ‘aspiration-reality gap’ due to stubborn differences between the reasons and expectations attached to their report and the ensuing criminal justice process and outcomes” (p. 190).  “Understanding how and why victim-survivors start their criminal justice journey is an essential precursor to meeting their needs and conceptualizing their experiences. The experiences of rape victims are varied, just as are the aspirations of these victims. The justice system clearly needs to be attentive to this variability if it wishes to narrow the aspiration-reality gap” (p. 191)., Reference: Brooks-Hay, Oona (2020).  Doing the “Right Thing”?  Understanding Why Rape Victims-Survivors Report to the Police.

"Governments can, with no extra cost, easily increase the likelihood that people will show up on time for court appearances. They need only to expend a very small amount of effort redesigning the summons that police give to accused people. In addition, with a very small expenditure, they can further reduce failures to appear by sending accused people a reminder by text message.",", Thousands of people in many countries fail to show up for scheduled court appearances.  Even though the original charge may be minor, those found guilty of failure to appear in court may be punished quite severely.  In Canada, 43% of those found guilty of this offence are imprisoned – a slightly higher rate than for criminal offences overall (39%)., This study suggests that there are some very simple solutions to the problem of failure to appear in court that are consistent with previous work (see Criminological Highlights 13(4)#1). The authors started with the assumption that for many people, failing to appear in court is a simple human error (perhaps because missing a court appearance may not be seen as a ‘big deal’ given that courts, themselves, force people to wait for hours for an ‘appointment’ that may only take a few minutes.)  If not showing up at court is, in many cases, simply a human error, then the challenge is straightforward: make it less likely that people make mistakes., The first study, carried out in New York City, redesigned the court summons form to simplify and highlight the relevant information.  The original summons prioritized information about the offence, description of the accused and the police officer, with the court date at the bottom. On the back of the form, accused people were told that arrest warrants could be issued for those who failed to comply.  The first experiment simply redesigned the summons to make relevant information (date and location of the appearance) more salient. Then, in bold print, it points out that a failure to appear would lead to a warrant being issued.   Police started using the newly designed summons when they ran out of the old ones, meaning that different police officers started using the new forms at different times – constituting a very strong quasi-experimental design. The new form, which cost essentially nothing to implement, reduced failure to appear from about 47% to 42%., In the second study, another inexpensive intervention was used: a text message to those who had received summons.  Those who were willing to give police officers their cell phone number were randomly assigned to one of four groups. The control group received no messages.  All text messages groups were messaged 7, 3, and 1 day(s) before the scheduled court date.  All messages included information about the date, time, and place of the court appearance.  But in addition, some people received suggestions to “plan” for the appearance (by marking calendars, etc.).  Another group received information about the consequences of failing to appear.  A third group got both sets of information. Receiving any of the three types of messages reduced the failure rate from about 38% to 30%., Other experiments carried out on people not facing charges suggested that the new summons form did, indeed, make it easier to see the court date/time information and to recall this information as well as information about the consequences of a failure to appear.  Interestingly, ordinary members of the community thought that failures to appear were intentional, not unintentional,  consequences of forgetting., Conclusion: Many people miss court dates for a very simple reason: they forget about them and may not think that the consequences are more serious than forgetting a dentist appointment.  Making the information about court appearance time/dates and legal consequences of a failure to appear salient and reminding people by text message of an approaching court date reduces the rate of failures to appear substantially., Reference: Fishbane, Alissa, Aurelie Ouss, and Anuj K.

"Drug courts do not reduce overall court caseloads.  Compared to arrests in cities without drug courts, the founding of a drug court in US cities with populations of 50,000 or more led to a 17% increase in arrests and charges for drug possession.",", Drug courts became popular among those who were looking for ways of reducing criminal justice involvement for those involved in the simple possession of certain drugs.  The theory was that by creating a “therapeutic” court, those using illegal drugs could be ‘treated’ rather than punished in ordinary courts. This paper suggests that one of the most important effects of opening a drug court is to encourage police to charge people whom they might otherwise have dealt with completely outside the court system., Drug courts are popular in many countries. In Canada, for example, the federal government (as of November 2020) indicated that it would fund the development, delivery and evaluation of drug treatment courts.  Evaluations appear to focus on quality of life improvements for those sent to drug court. One problem, of course, is that providing services through court systems can be both expensive and stigmatizing and may draw expensive drug treatment resources away from non-criminal justice settings.  And if many of those in drug court would not have been arrested were it not for the existence of a drug court, there may be very little, if any, ‘added value’ of having a drug court. The original theory behind drug courts was that their ‘clients’ (accused people) would, in the absence of a drug court, have been (fully) prosecuted criminally for their drug offence.  This paper suggests that this is not the case., This study examines what happened in 257 US cities with populations of 50,000 or more. Cities that started a drug court were matched with 115 statistically similar cities that never had a drug court, using a “propensity score” approach where the propensity to have a drug court in 1996-7 was used for matching purposes.  Various statistical techniques were used to estimate the impact of drug court implementation on arrests in those cities with drug courts compared to those cities that never had them., Misdemeanor drug arrests increased substantially in US cities during the 1990s.  More importantly, the increase was larger in those cities with drug courts than those without drug courts.  These results were not driven solely by large cities.  This effect persisted “across a variety of specifications with controls for demographic and economic influences as well as measures of police force size and enforcement activity” (p. 300)., These results are similar to previous findings on the impact of drug courts (see Criminological Highlights 16(6)#7).  During this period of time drug use arrests generally increased in the US while drug sales arrests declined somewhat.  This was true both in drug court and nondrug court jurisdictions. Instead, what appeared to have happened is that “the long-term dedication of resources toward relatively minor offenders may have exacerbated the nationwide focus on minor drug offences, resulting in an unintended net-widening effect” (p. 301)., Conclusion:  The challenge for drug courts from their inception has been a practical one.  Are public resources being allocated effectively to address the drug addictions of those who would benefit most from proven drug treatments, and are drug courts the best way for communities or governments to allocate those resources?   One problem is that other research suggests that many drug court participants are not chemically dependent but participate in drug court because they see drug courts as creating fewer negative consequences than ordinary court. If, without the presence of a drug court, such non-chemically dependent drug users would not be arrested (as shown in this study), it would mean that scarce treatment resources are being wasted on those apparently not in need of treatment., Reference: Lilly, David R., Megan D.

A psychometric measure that predicts recidivism in a prison population may be of little use for the purpose of assessing whether an individual prisoner has become less of a risk after participating in a correctional program.,", Some correctional programs have been demonstrated to be effective in reducing reoffending for certain types of prisoners.  And some psychometric measures used with prisoners have been shown to correlate with reoffending after a prisoner has been released.  This paper asks an important question: Does change in the score on such a psychometric measure after participating in a correctional program predict recidivism?, It is generally accepted that all prisoners who participate in a correctional program do not necessarily benefit from it.  It seems natural, then, to use change on a “proven” psychometric measure (after treatment compared to before treatment) to see whether a person has become less at risk to re-offend if they were released.  At the same time, it is necessary to control for a prisoner’s pre-treatment risk and needs.  Otherwise, it is impossible to know whether an effect is really due to a change that has occurred in the prisoner rather than something about their initial risk and needs., This study looked at 227 prisoners in Canada’s federal penitentiaries who were serving sentences averaging 6.7 years.   They had participated in a cognitive behavioural violence prevention program.  In previous studies, program participants had been shown to have lower recidivism rates than ‘equivalent’ non-participants, suggesting, logically, that the program had made them less likely to offend.  All participants in this study were deemed by Correctional Service Canada to be “persistently violent” (p. 222) meaning that they had at least 2 convictions for violence and had been assessed to be high risk to commit further violent offences.  Prisoners were followed for 5 years (or until they had been convicted of a new criminal offence)., Five standard measures related to individual aggression were used to assess pre- to post-program change in the prisoners (an aggression questionnaire, a measure of various components of anger, a measure of anger in response to provocation, an impulsivity scale, and a general violence risk scale).  The pre- to post-treatment changes were substantial on all measures (nearly a full standard deviation)., The most important finding was that in no cases did change on any of the five scales predict violent recidivism within either 3 or 5 years of release.  When looking at ‘general recidivism’ there were small negative relationships between change on 2 of the 5 scales and recidivism at 3 years and one small effect in the opposite direction --favourable change being associated with higher general recidivism within 5 years of release., The results suggest that “it may be erroneous to rely on apparent within-treatment change in some key constructs – such as anger and impulsivity – ostensibly targeted and measured after the course of intervention” (p. 227) when determining how prisoners should serve their sentences and when they should be released.  Change on these scales as a result of treatment does not help predict violent reoffending upon release., Conclusion:  The findings of this study question in important ways the usefulness of measured change on standard psychometric instruments in assessing whether prisoners are likely to reoffend upon release.   Said differently, this study demonstrates that a prisoner who does not show any apparent change in their measured risk to reoffend violently after participating in a program may be no more likely to reoffend violently than a prisoner whose test scores suggest that a program has reduced the likelihood of reoffending., Reference: Higgs, Tamsin, Mark E.

"Those convicted of offences do not always prefer community sanctions to imprisonment.  For many people under active supervision in the community, many of whom had previously served jail sentences, a jail sentence of up to 14 days would be preferable to what might look, to many, as relatively lenient community punishments (e.g., 23 days of electronic monitoring).",", There is, in many jurisdictions, concern about the overuse of prison or jail sentences, especially short sentences.  The belief is that it would be better to substitute community-based punishments. This paper examines how these community-based punishments are perceived by those who are subjected to them., Short periods of time in jail or prison can be expensive and are generally not seen as serving community safety functions.  Hence there is a tendency to look to community sanctions as viable alternatives.  But in a sentencing system that is based at least in part on the notion that the punitive aspects of the sanction should be proportionate to the harm that was done, there is a need to think about equivalences: what kind of community sanction is likely to be as punitive as a sentence involving incarceration of a given length?, Obviously, community sanctions vary in their punitiveness.  One could easily imagine that a large number of community service hours (e.g., spent picking up trash along a highway) would be more punitive than a few days in jail.  But how many hours of community service would be equivalent to, for example, 7 days in jail? In this study, 185 adult probationers were recruited for a survey. About half were unemployed and 68% reported their financial situation as either “struggling” or “falling way behind” (p. 703).  Most (58%) had experienced jail sentences in the past, 43% had experienced enhanced drug testing, and 43% had experienced community service. 28% were on a form of enhanced supervision., Participants were given written descriptions of sanctions (jail, written assignments, outpatient treatment, electronic monitoring, curfew, day reporting, enhanced drug testing, community service, halfway house placement and inpatient treatment).  They were then asked to estimate the maximum amount of the alternative sanction they would be willing to complete in order to avoid serving a specified time – 2, 7 and 14 days – in jail., Using the median equivalency score as the equivalent, inpatient treatment and halfway house placement were seen as equally punitive as jail.  What is notable about the other equivalences is that relatively small amounts of each “community sanction” were seen as being equivalent to short jail sentences.  For example, 14 days of living under a curfew was seen as equivalent to 7 days in jail.  30 hours of community service was seen as equivalent to 14 days in jail.  And 14 days of electronic monitoring was seen as equivalent to 7 days of jail.  No community sanctions were seen as easy: the median number of pages a probationer would be willing to write (on a topic such as “detailing the negative physical effects of long-term marijuana use”) instead of 7 days in jail was 10 pages., The strongest single predictor of the severity of the alternative the probationer was willing to endure instead of prison was the level of stress that the probationer reported experiencing at the time that the survey was carried out:  As levels of stress increased, the number of hours or days of the alternative sanction that the person was willing to experience in lieu of a jail sentence decreased., Conclusion: “There is little evidence that individuals under community supervision draw sharp distinctions between jail and community-based sanctions in terms of their overall punitiveness.” (p. 713).  Judges who might worry about a community-based sanction not being experienced as a punishment should feel reassured by this finding.  But the findings also imply that “decision-makers should use restraint when doling out community-based punishments, as it does not take exorbitant amounts of community sanctions to achieve a substantial punitive effect” (p. 713)., Reference: Wodahl, Eric J., Brett E.

"Reduced levels of self-control may be an important determinant of offending by youths. But in addition, reduced levels of self-control can be the result of youths’ experiences of school sanctions and police contact.",", It has often been shown that “individuals low in self-control tend to place little weight on the generally long-term consequences of their criminal actions and tend to overvalue the mostly immediate benefits” (p. 200).  At the same time, however, there is evidence that the level of self-control within an individual may not be very stable over time., This paper suggests that sanctioning practices themselves may reduce levels of self-control for three reasons: (1) Sanctioning processes, such as interactions with police, may be perceived as disrespectful and unfair by those subjected to them; (2) Sanctioning may trigger feelings of anger and resentment; and (3) Sanctions may lead people to seek out or find themselves in environments that encourage short-sighted behaviour., This paper is based on a longitudinal study of youths in Zurich, using data from three separate periods when youths averaged 13.7, 15.4, and 17.4 years of age. Delinquency, operationalized as the number (maximum =14) of different types of offences the youth self-reported for the past year, was measured at each of point in time.  Self-control was measured when the youths averaged 13.7 and 15.4 years with such questions as “I often act on the spur of the moment without stopping to think” (p. 204).  Police contact in the previous year and school sanctions in the previous 2 years were measured when the youths averaged 15.4 years.  This allowed analyses to be carried out that looked at change in the self-control measure between age 13.7 and 15.4, and to see whether these changes were associated with increased delinquency reported at age 17.4.   Various other control variables measured when the youths were 13.7 years old were included in the analysis.  These included sex, ethnicity, and the family’s socio-economic status., Police contact prior to the time when the youth was about 15.4 years old predicted short-sightedness at age 15.4 controlling for the level of short-sightedness at age 13.7.  Said differently, police contact made youths more short-sighted in their actions than they had been before.  And short-sightedness at age 15.4 predicted delinquency at age 17.4 year, even when controlling for delinquency when the youth was 13.7 years old.   Similar results were found for school sanctions.  Those who experienced sanctioning from the school showed increased short-sightedness.  And this, in turn led to increased delinquency at age 17.4., When thinking about the relationship between ‘self-control’ and offending, we typically think that those whose thinking focuses on the short-term and who do not show self-control will tend to be higher rate offenders since they aren’t thinking about the consequences of their behaviour.  These findings do not challenge that causal ordering, but instead suggest that the causality may also be in the opposite direction:  those who are sanctioned by the police or by schools become more oriented toward the present rather than the future and, as a result, are more likely to offend in the future., Conclusion: “The finding that sanctions predict delinquency, while contradicting deterrence theory, provides further empirical support for previous empirical research suggesting either no effect of sanctioning or the finding that sanctioning actually contributes to reoffending rather than preventing it” (p. 213).  Sanctioning, then, may undermine self-control.  Hence it is possible that “criminogenic factors, such as sanctioning or cumulative disadvantage, are related to crime precisely because they impact on people’s levels of short-sightedness and their ability to exert self-control” (p. 214)., Reference: Van Gelder, Jean-Louis, Margit Averdijk, Denis Ribeaud, and Manuel Eisner (2020).  Sanctions, short-term mindsets, and delinquency: Reverse causality in a sample of high school youth.

The effects of the electronic monitoring of those convicted of offences are inconsistent enough to warrant the conclusion that electronic monitoring cannot be assumed to be a useful technology.,", Electronic monitoring (EM), typically accomplished with a device being attached to offenders’ wrists or ankles, is used a variety of different ways in the criminal justice system, including as a condition of bail, as part of a community sentence, or as a way of monitoring those released from prison. As the technology has become more sophisticated and possibly less expensive, questions have arisen concerning its effectiveness (in accomplishing various goals), as well as its appropriateness., One consistent concern about EM is that it is often an “add on” to some existing form of community punishment. Furthermore, it is often used on those deemed to be low risk.  But an additional problem is that when people think about the effectiveness of EM, they need to think carefully about what EM is compared to. If, for example, “community sanctions with EM” is compared to incarceration (in prison or jails), then one doesn’t know whether any effects that might appear are due to EM or the fact that any community sanction might differ from incarceration.  This review focuses primarily on whether EM can be used to reduce reoffending., After an extensive search of 14 electronic databases and an examination of the 4,662 records of studies that looked at EM, it was discovered that there were only 34 studies that had quantitative findings based on plausible research designs.  But only 18 of these studies reported quantitative findings in a manner that allowed inferences about the size of the effect of EM on offending.  In only two studies were participants randomly assigned to EM or some comparison treatment., There was substantial variation in the outcomes across studies.  In only about 5 of the individual studies were there effects larger than one might expect by chance.  But even then, the results were inconsistent across methods of combining the findings across studies. One approach suggested that EM might be effective in reducing recidivism, but using a more conservative approach, there was no significant effect.  More importantly, perhaps, the 7 highest quality studies showed no significant effects of EM vs. some comparison., More interesting is the fact that when EM was compared to “business as usual” in that jurisdiction (typically unmonitored community sentences), there were no significant differences. But when EM in the community was compared to imprisonment, the results favoured EM. Taken together, these findings challenge the idea that EM reduces reoffending.  It is quite plausible that the EM vs. imprisonment comparisons are simply another illustration of a negative impact of imprisonment (compared to a community sanction with or without EM).   However, looking only at the positive effects – where EM was associated with reduced reoffending – there is little evidence in this study that allows one to make “confident identification of the mechanisms that produce the effect of EM on recidivism” (p. 15)., Finally, EM is considerably more expensive than ordinary supervision in the community, though it is almost certainly less expensive than imprisonment., Conclusion: The most obvious conclusion from this thorough review is that the effects of electronic monitoring (EM) on reoffending are likely to vary across circumstances and populations of offenders.  Thus whether the recidivism rates of those in the community are compared to other community sentences without EM or imprisonment will make a difference.  And the type of offender may also make a difference. Hence it would seem that the one firm conclusion from the research on EM is that any jurisdiction thinking of implementing a new program involving EM should evaluate it carefully looking not only at recidivism but also costs – to the justice system as well as to those who are subject to it., Reference: Belur, Juoti, Amy Thornton and four others (2020).  A Systematic Review of the Effectiveness of the Electronic Monitoring of Offenders.  Journal of Criminal Justice, 68, 1-18., Back to top",https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV19N1.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-19-no-1-%E2%80%93-december-2020,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 19, No. 1 – December 2020",Regular Issue,2020
"Punishment in the criminal justice system starts long before anyone is found guilty and sentenced. Those arrested and detained in prison prior to trial – a larger number in Canada than those receiving prison sentences after conviction – often receive serious punishments as a consequence of their arrest, their experience in courts, and their time in prison, even if they are eventually not convicted or sentenced to prison.","In Ontario, Canada, in 2015, over 91 thousand people were arrested and held for a bail hearing. Although more than a third of them were, ultimately, not found guilty of any offence, it would be wrong to suggest that they – as well as those ultimately found guilty – were not punished prior to the disposition of their cases., “The hidden nature of the process of arrest, court appearances, and detention obscures the ways in which people may experience important consequences and even punishment on remand, without ever being formally ‘marked’ by a criminal conviction” (p. 2). This paper uses data from interviews (1-3 hours in length) with 120 people (60 men and 60 women) held in pretrial custody in four large correctional institutions in Ontario., When people were arrested, it was typically unexpected. Although people had a legal right to consult a lawyer following their arrest (typically a phone call to a legal aid lawyer), the vast majority (84%) were not given an opportunity to notify family or kinship networks upon their arrest, making it difficult for people to get personal assistance in responding to their detention. Even when there was no active mistreatment by the police, other punishments (e.g., not having access to prescription medications) followed automatically from the accused person’s removal from daily routines and isolation from normal contacts and supports., If an accused’s bail decision was not made at the first court appearance, they would be transported to a provincial prison. Court days – often more than one before bail was resolved – typically meant starting the day at 5 a.m. and being transported to court while handcuffed (sometimes also with ankle shackles) and often chained to at least one other prisoner. The conditions of the court’s holding facilities, waiting for the case, and the uncertainty of what would occur, were each seen as stressful. Lunch typically consisted of a single granola bar. The logistics of transportation were such that when the accused were returned to prison, they were too late for dinner. Some prisoners were required to appear in court in whatever clothing they had on when arrested (e.g., a bikini covered by a paper jumpsuit in the case of one woman arrested at a hotel swimming pool). Not surprisingly, 71% of those interviewed preferred, if possible, to appear in court by video link rather than in person., Prisoners were held in ‘basic’ cells in maximum security institutions.  New technologies have made communication with the outside world more difficult. Communication is important because remand prisoners often need to talk to friends and relatives to create a plan for release that will satisfy a court.  Prisoners could only call a land line because all calls were “collect” and cellular phones do not accept collect calls. Lockdowns, when visitors were not permitted into the institutions, occurred frequently.   These barriers made ordinary visits with those outside difficult, but also made preparation of a bail release plan that could be presented to court an extra challenge., Conclusion:  In recent years, the calculation of credit off one’s sentence for pretrial custody has been a contentious issue in Canada.   However, the focus on credit off a sentence “neglects the fact that many people who enter remand imprisonment return to their communities without a conviction….  Participants in this study described the harms of arrest and making court appearances as the most visceral and painful aspects of remand imprisonment…. Each [part of the system – police, courts, and corrections] plays a separate but related role in forming the experience of punishment for remand prisoners” (p. 15).  With the common focus on the sentence as the punishment, it is important to remember that “the collective weight of the cross-institutional remand process imposes harms on individuals that can have substantial and negative consequences on their lives in the short and long term” (p. 16)., Reference:  Pelvin, Holly (2019).  Remand as a Cross-Institutional System: Examining the Process of Punishment before Conviction.  Canadian Journal of Criminology and Criminal Justice (online pre-publication)., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV17N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-17-no-6-%E2%80%93-march-2019,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 17, No. 6 – March 2019",Regular Issue,2019
"Imprisoning men for 4 to 10 months, rather than sentencing them to probation, reduces the likelihood that they will be employed in the three years after they return to the community.",", Those released from prison are typically disadvantaged economically and have difficulty finding employment.  One might expect that imprisonment would interfere with employment for many reasons including: (a) The stigma associated with prison may make employers especially reluctant to employ someone who was imprisoned; (b) Imprisonment may strengthen the person’s criminal self-identity; (c) Prisoners will not accumulate work experience commensurate with that of someone in the community., This study, carried out in Sweden, examines the relationship between imprisonment and subsequent employment. Data from other Scandinavian studies suggest that those who are imprisoned tend to have weak links with employment even before their imprisonment.  Hence there is an obvious challenge in understanding whether the experience of imprisonment itself has negative impacts on subsequent employment., This paper uses data from all males born in 1975 and 1980 who were residents of Sweden at age 16.  By age 30, 28.9% had at least one criminal conviction and 3.7% had been sentenced to prison (typically when age 20 or older). Because of the ability to link administrative data on Swedish citizens, not only were (legal) employment records available but other relevant data (e.g., education records, immigration status, mental health diagnoses, criminal records) were also available.  For matching purposes, the analysis was restricted to those sentenced either to prison or probation for the first time at age 20-25.  The focus was on those who received an intermediate length prison term of 4-10 months.  Shorter prison sentences might have been served in the community with electronic monitoring; longer sentences were more difficult to find equivalent cases that received probation., Propensity score matching was carried out in two stages. First, the likelihood of going to prison was estimated for all those who received either a 4-10 month prison sentence or probation.  Next, a person who was in fact sentenced to prison was matched with 3 people who had the same likelihood of going to prison but instead received a sentence of probation., Compared to those who were never convicted of a criminal offence, involvement in work between age 20 and age 30 for those who were convicted of a criminal offence and received probation sentences was, not surprisingly, lower.  Involvement in work was lower still for those who spent 4-10 months in prison., When one looks at equivalant groups of men who either received probation or prison sentences, there were no differences in employment records prior to being sentenced.  For the first three years after being sentenced, however, those who received a prison sentence were less likely to be involved in work than those who received probation. This difference was no longer significant after 4 years. There was some indication that the effect was driven largely by those who had been working prior to their conviction., Conclusion:  Men sentenced for criminal matters tend to be disadvantaged in many ways, including their ability to get jobs.  Being imprisoned for 4-10 months – especially for those who were working prior to being convicted – appears to make it even less likely that they will be employed in the first few years after they have served their sentences., Reference: Bäckman, Olaf, Filipe Estrada and Anders Nilsson (2018).  Locked Up and Locked Out?  The Impact of Imprisonment on Labour Market Attachment.  British Journal of Criminology, 58, 1044-1065., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV17N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-17-no-6-%E2%80%93-march-2019,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 17, No. 6 – March 2019",Regular Issue,2019
Allowing prisoners the opportunity to leave prison for short periods of time appears to make correctional sense: those allowed temporary absences from Canadian penitentiaries are less likely to be unemployed when they achieve full release from prison and are less likely to be returned to prison (either for a new offence or a violation of a condition of release).,", Canadian prisoners can be released temporarily from penitentiaries (where they are serving sentences of 2 years or more) by way of either an “escorted temporary absence” (ETA), where they are supervised, or an “unescorted” (UTA), where they are not supervised.  Typically, prisoners who have received a UTA have previously had successful ETAs., This paper examines whether ETAs/UTAs are effective in helping prisoners obtain employment and if they contribute to lower rates of reoffending or revocation of full releases because of violations of conditions of release.  In Canada, prisoners are normally eligible for release on (full) parole after serving 1/3 of their sentences and, if refused parole, they are typically released with supervision after serving 2/3 of their sentences.  Excluding any temporary absence (TA) for medical or administrative purpose, the study examined TAs granted between 2005 and 2011 to prisoners during their first sentence within this period., TAs (both ETAs and UTAs) are generally more available to “offenders with less history of serious offending and [who were] less likely to have previous problems in institutions and while on [previous sentences involving] community supervision” (p. 29). Therefore, it was necessary to assess the effects of ETAs and UTAs in comparison to equivalent prisoners who did not receive either form of TA.  To create equivalent groups, propensity score matching was carried out whereby background characteristics were used to calculate the likelihood that a person would receive a TA.  Twenty-seven variables were used to calculate propensity scores for receiving a UTA (28 for an ETA).  These included various forms of risk, current offence and sentence, previous convictions, a statistical prediction of recidivism and reintegration potential, age, whether the offender was Indigenous, and sex. Hence any effects that were obtained are over-and-above the best prediction available to Correctional Service Canada on recidivism and reintegration potential (as well as other variables). It should be pointed out that the failure rate for those on TAs was very low – approximately 1%., The results are straightforward.  The effects of TAs overall as well as ETAs and UTAs were largest (and significant) for employment.  Unemployment (defined as no record of employment during the two years after release) was reduced if the prisoner received either an ETA or a UTA.   In addition, returns after full release for technical violations or for new offences were reduced if a prisoner had been granted an ETA or a UTA.  In general, the effects were larger for UTAs than for ETAs, meaning that UTAs were more effective than ETAs in reducing unemployment, reoffending, and violating conditions of release., Relatively few prisoners (about 4% of the sample) ever received a UTA.  Hence it was not possible to test whether higher numbers of UTAs led to reduced unemployment and lowered re-offending or rates of technical violations.  But for ETAs and TAs (overall) it appears that the more temporary absences that a prisoner received, the more favourable the outcome after (full) release from prison., Conclusion: The results support the view that taking small risks in the form of releasing prisoners on escorted and unescorted temporary absences reduces, in the two years following release, three problems: (a) the likelihood that the prisoner, when released, would be unemployed; (b) the rate of return to prison for a violation of the conditions of release: and (c) recidivism.  Generally speaking, more is better: “The more absences an offender received, the less likely they were to have negative outcomes in the community” (p. 37)., Refernece: Helmus, L.

"To minimize the harmful effects of imprisonment and to contribute to the rehabilitation of prisoners, the architectural design of prisons should follow principles that will “inspire prisoners and motivate them to lead better lives” (p. 329).",", Concern that prison design may hinder rather than help the rehabilitation of prisoners has been discussed since the late-18th century when John Howard was promoting healthy prisons in various parts of the world.   The concern about prison design was raised in an important Canadian report when, in August 1966, the Canadian Committee on Corrections (the “Ouimet Committee”) submitted a report on the design of a new penitentiary that was to be built in Quebec. The committee suggested a number of important changes be made to create a more rehabilitative institution. The Solicitor General of Canada had asked the committee to comment on a draft design because of obvious concerns that it might not foster rehabilitation., Prisons are often designed to be built rapidly rather than being designed to serve broader rehabilitative needs. Unfortunately, one of the results of the political need to spend as little money as possible and to have the prison operational as quickly as possible is that the long-term interests of prisoners and prison employees are given little weight.  Rarely, for example, are prisoners, ex-prisoners, or prison staff consulted on any important aspects of design of prisons.  In contrast, when building other institutions (e.g., residential care homes for the elderly) those using and working in the facility are typically part of the development team.  Similarly, there is an understanding now, among architects, that the design of hospitals can contribute to the health of those who are in them., Prisoners, for example, need some opportunities for privacy, for reasonable heating and ventilation, for high-quality family visits. They can benefit from the ability to do work and programming without unnecessary impediments, and they can benefit from having some choices or autonomy over these matters.  These same issues differentiate healthy from ‘unhealthy’ hospitals.  Often held out as an example of good design, Norway’s most progressive prison was designed “to inspire prisoners and motivate them to lead better lives” rather than to mirror the lives they came from.   Hence, although issues of security were not ignored, attempts were made to minimize the punitive aspects of normal prison design (bars, ever-visible security, etc.).  Similarly, two high security prisons in Catalonia “attempt to put prisoner rehabilitation at the heart of design” (p. 329) by allowing or even encouraging movement (which is monitored with closed circuit TV) and interaction with others.  The actual cells are described as “basic” in part because it is assumed that prisoners will not spend much time in them., It was also noted that “If prison architects design high-quality facilities for staff – working spaces where they feel safe and able to exercise their power, interpersonal skills and discretion appropriately” (p. 332) – while simultaneously providing pleasant work spaces (and even adequate parking), “a prison is more likely to have a happy and motivated workforce who feel invested in and valued as the considerable assets they are” (p. 333).  In contrast, in many English prisons, “staff feel that the provisions made for them are very much a second thought” (p. 333)., Conclusion: “Buildings help to enact ideologies through the social practices they enable and encourage…. The notion of trauma-informed design is beginning to penetrate discussions of planned new women’s prisons [in the UK].  [At the same time] the topic of ‘good’ prison design is… fraught with political minefields” (p. 333).   Good prison design need not be seen as ‘softer’ or ‘prettier’; good design need not challenge the institution of the prison.  At the same time, however, “designing prison spaces that support rehabilitation and desistance could be a vital component in achieving radical justice reform….” (p. 334)., Reference: Jewkes, Yvonne (2018).

"US imprisonment rates have been declining for about 8 years. At the current average rate of decline, US imprisonment will be at the 1980 rate in the year 2052. Releasing prisoners before their expected release dates would ensure a quicker return to 1980 levels without increasing crime.",", An earlier study (Criminological Highlights 14(5)#6) suggested that reoffending rates for US federal prisoners who were unexpectedly given a reduction in their sentences were no different from the reoffending rates of those who served their full sentences. That paper looked at those released in 2008 as a result of US Sentencing Commission guideline changes that were retroactively applied., In addition to reducing the disparity in sentencing for those involved in cocaine vs. crack drug offences, the 2010 US Fair Sentencing Act also eliminated or restricted certain mandatory minimum sentences.  The US Sentencing Commission allowed these changes to be applied retroactively., The results were consistent across comparisons.  Overall the three-year recidivism rates (arrests for new offences, or a court or supervision violation) were identical – 37.9%. About a third those who “reoffended” committed  ‘court or supervision’ violations.  This finding – similar recidivism rates for those serving their full sentences and those released early – held for all three major race/ethnicity groups (Black, White, Hispanic), males and females, those with varying amounts of education, those under and over 30 years old, those with minor and substantial criminal history scores, and those whose offences involved or did not involve a weapon.  The prisoners examined in this study varied in terms of whether they had been sentenced within, above, or below, the sentencing guideline range.  Again, however, there were no differences, within each of these groups, on the recidivism rates for those who served their full sentences and those who received the benefit of the retroactive changes in their sentences.  Similarly, the findings held for those with sentences under 10 years in length and 10 years or more., Conclusion: An unexpected reduction of prison time of (on average) 30 months did not affect reoffending rates for these drug offenders.  This finding – no change in reoffending – held for various subgroups that were examined.   Obviously, one cannot automatically assume that the results would be the same if other prisoners were unexpectedly released from prison early. The results do suggest, however, that presumptively there is little risk to public safety by extending these early-release policies to others serving time in prison at least for non-violent offences., Reference: Hunt, Kim Steven, Kevin Maass, and Todd Kostyhak (2018).

The use of police powers to stop and search members of the public is not an effective way of deterring crime.,", The use of stop and search (S&S) powers by the police is controversial for many reasons, including the fact that S&S often is used disproportionately on racial/ethnic individuals.  In 2014/15 in England, for example, Blacks were four times as likely to be searched than Whites. A common justification for the use of S&Ss is that they are effective in deterring crime., This study looks at 10 years of data from London, England, to determine what impact these activities have on crime rates in the location in which the S&S takes place.  The impact of S&S on crime “is not the legal justification for most searches” (p. 1213). Rather, S&Ss are typically described as being used for investigatory purposes.  Nevertheless, police often talk about S&S powers in terms of controlling crime in specific locations.  This makes it difficult to separate out the effects of S&Ss from the possible impact of high concentrations of police in particular locations (e.g., hot-spot policing) whether they are doing S&Ss or not. In other words, if S&Ss were actually associated with lower crime in a particular location, it could be that the effect was due to higher police concentration rather than S&S activities., For this study, data from 31 of the 32 London boroughs (excluding Westminster – the central area including the Houses of Parliament, Buckingham palace, etc.) were examined. The effects of S&Ss on categories of crime that might be susceptible to S&S as well as ambulance calls for “stab/shot/weapon wounds” were examined for the period April 2004 to November 2014.  Daily rates of recorded S&S were obtained for each borough., The approach was to see whether S&S activities affected crime in the following week or month on the theory that people might adjust their (crime) activity on the basis of what was happening in a particular part of the city. In order to control for general police activities, the number of police in each borough in the time period was controlled for as were long-term changes in crime in the borough., The effects of searches on crime were examined for the following week and the following month. All searches and specific types of justifications for searches were examined.  There were no consistent effects of S&Ss for non-domestic violent crime, burglary, robbery and theft, vehicle crime and criminal damage.  In addition, using crime-injury ambulance calls as a second indicator of (serious) violence, there was no evidence that increased S&S reduced violence., There was, however, a significant impact on drug crime: a 10% increase in total searches resulted in a 1.85% reduction in recorded drug offences in the following month.  Though this would appear to support the idea that “drug users and dealers stop offending when perceived risk reaches a certain level… another possibility is that higher rates of S&S prompt people to change their behaviour to make it harder for officers to uncover drugs… or that people carrying drugs are simply displaced to nearby areas that are less ‘hot’ in terms of police activity” (p. 1224-5). Furthermore, of course, “police recorded crime data are unlikely to be the most reliable measure of drug crime… [since they] will depend largely on police activity that discovers people in possession of drugs and not on the underlying prevalence of drug use” (p. 1225)., Conclusion:  Though there is some indication of an effect of stop and search on drug crime (which might still be explained by other mechanisms), the effects overall do not suggest that stop and search by police is effective in reducing the kinds of crime that would appear to be most likely to be affected by this approach.  Given these results, it may be important to re-focus attention on an issue not addressed in this study: “the need to limit its use to appropriate situations to avoid damage to public trust and police legitimacy” (p. 1227)., Reference: Tiratelli, Matteo, Paul Quinton, and Bed Bradford (2018).  Does Stop and Search Deter Crime?  Evidence From Ten Years of London-Wide Data.  British Journal of Criminology, 58, 1212-1231., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV17N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-17-no-6-%E2%80%93-march-2019,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 17, No. 6 – March 2019",Regular Issue,2019
"A commercially available algorithmic pretrial risk assessment system, COMPAS, disadvantages accused people who are Hispanic.",", “Automated risk assessment is all the rage in the criminal justice system” (p. 1). Previous research (Criminological Highlights 17(2)#1) has suggested that these instruments aren’t better than ordinary people’s intuitive risk assessments and that they disadvantage Black people., One problem with these risk assessment programs is that the manner in which predictions are made is proprietary knowledge and therefore cannot be directly assessed.  Hence if a risk assessment tool does not take into account the unique characteristics of a group (e.g., women, Indigenous people, Hispanics), it may unfairly disadvantage members of that group because factors that lead to increased risk scores for groups on which the instrument was originally validated (often white men) may not be at all relevant for members of other groups., The prediction algorithm that is the focus of this study – COMPAS – uses about two dozen measures to predict general and violent recidivism.  The study analyzes Florida data on 6,172 cases in which COMPAS was used to predict general recidivism and 4,020 cases in which predictions of violent recidivism were made.  Recidivism was defined as re-arrest within 2 years.  The study examines the recidivism rates of Hispanic and non-Hispanic accused people arrested in Broward County, Florida., There are two ways in which a scale can disadvantage a particular group, in this case Hispanics. First, the test may not discriminate as well for those in the minority group as it does for those in the majority group on which it was developed. Second, members of a minority group with the same scores as members of the majority group may, in fact, be less likely to re-offend., COMPAS, it would appear, has both of these problems.  For example, for non-Hispanics, the group on which the measure was developed, the higher the score, the more likely it was that a person would reoffend.  This was true for both general recidivism and violent recidivism.  For Hispanic accused, on the other hand, the likelihood of general recidivism was the same for those with medium and high COMPAS scores.   For violent recidivism, the actual recidivism rates were essentially the same for those with low and moderate COMPAS scores., More dramatic, perhaps, are the comparisons between Hispanic and non-Hispanic accused people. Hispanics and non-Hispanics who were predicted to have high general recidivism differed dramatically in their actual recidivism rates: Hispanic accused were considerably less likely to reoffend than non-Hispanic accused with the same scores. In a similar vein, Hispanic accused who were predicted by the algorithm to have a moderate likelihood of violent recidivism were considerably less likely to reoffend than non-Hispanics with similar COMPAS scores.  Other analyses resulted in essentially the same findings: For general and violent recidivism, the COMPAS score was less effective at predicting recidivism for Hispanics as it was for non-Hispanics., Conclusion: The overall data are very clear.  Though the algorithms do not explicitly consider cultural groups, the algorithm is considerably less accurate in predicting recidivism for Hispanics. The data demonstrate that an ethnicity-neutral algorithm over-predicts recidivism for Hispanics. Said differently, the algorithm systematically makes certain Hispanic accused people look more dangerous than, in fact, they are.  Clearly “greater care should be taken to ensure that proper validation studies should be undertaken to confirm that any algorithmic risk is fair for its intended population and subpopulations” (p.29)., Reference: Hamilton, Melissa (2019).  The Biased Algorithm: Evidence of Disparate Impact on Hispanics.  American Criminal Law Review, 56, (in press)., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV17N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-17-no-6-%E2%80%93-march-2019,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 17, No. 6 – March 2019",Regular Issue,2019
"This study replicates, using a randomized control trial, the findings from previous studies of a high intensity community program for sex offenders being released from prison into the community. The program is shown to be effective in reducing reoffending for moderate risk sex offenders followed for an average of about 6 years.",", Although many people apparently believe that programs for sex offenders don’t work, this turns out not to be true (Criminological Highlights 9(5)#7).  One of the programs that has been demonstrated to be effective in helping sex offenders who were released from Canadian penitentiaries without any supervision or support is “Circles of Support and Accountability” (CoSA)  (Criminological Highlights 9(3)#6, 11(2)#6)., This paper extends the previous research by examining recidivism for 100 moderate risk sex offenders all of whom had volunteered to this program.  They were randomly assigned to participate in the CoSA program (n=50) or ‘treatment as usual’ (n=50) while still in prison but soon to be on supervision.  In this implementation in Minnesota, the sex offender (or ‘central member’ [CM] of the circle) met several times with 4-6 trained community volunteers while still in prison.  These same people formed the CoSA for the CM in the community after release., The volunteers, who formed the other members of the circle, were typically local college students. Because the CoSA approach is labour intensive, getting volunteers who were willing to make a long-term commitment (weekly meetings in a secure public venue with the CM for 6-12 months) was difficult.  As a result, people were identified as potential CMs only when sufficient volunteers had been identified for a CoSA.  Because there were more sex offenders being released from prison than could be accommodated in the program, random assignment was seen as the fairest way to decide which prisoners would receive the CoSA treatment and which would receive normal community supervision., The program was carried out in a number of locations in Minnesota.  The data for this study (for 50 CoSA CMs and 50 controls) come from CoSAs carried out between January 2008 and June 2016.  The cutoff date for the collection of recidivism data was June 2017, meaning that the follow-up period varied from 12 to 113 months (mean = 73 months).  Because of random assignment, the follow-up period did not differ across groups., Prisoners who received the CoSA treatment were significantly less likely to recidivate according to all four measures that were examined.   Consistent with other research, sex offender re-arrest was low for both groups (CoSA = 2%, Control=14%).  No CoSA CMs were reconvicted of a sex offence, compared to 8% of the controls.  Many of the 100 people were rearrested for some offence (CoSA = 60%; Control 80%), and many were reconvicted of some offence (COSA = 50%, Control = 68%)., Conclusion:  This study, using random assignment – the “gold standard” of evaluation research – provides strong evidence confirming the results of previous studies of Circles of Support and Accountability.  This approach involves a commitment of 4-6 community volunteers to meet weekly for 6-12 months to help those returning to the community after serving a prison sentence for a sex offence.  The results are consistent  across four measures of recidivism. The program reduced both general and sexual reoffending in a period lasting an average of about 6 years after release from prison., Reference: Duwe, Grant (2018).  Can Circles of Support and Accountability (CoSA) Significantly Reduce Recidivism?  Results from a Randomized Controlled Trial in Minnesota.  Journal of Experimental Criminology, 14, 463-484., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV17N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-17-no-6-%E2%80%93-march-2019,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 17, No. 6 – March 2019",Regular Issue,2019
"Much of the policing of homeless people in urban settings begins with calls from the public rather than police-initiated actions.

This broad and intensive study of the policing of homelessness in San Francisco, California, demonstrates that the police, responding to complaints from the public, can impose excruciatingly punitive actions completely outside of the criminal law., The author of this study spent much of 9 months living on the streets, in shelters and other temporary housing with homeless people. In addition, he spent many days and nights with the police and public health workers, etc., observing the treatment of the homeless. The study includes data from a quantitative analysis of calls to the police and municipality for “homeless concerns” as well as survey data from homeless people. He also worked in the city office charged with the responsibility for responding to homelessness., Though obviously San Francisco has a ‘homelessness problem’, an important change that has taken place over the past few years is the dramatic increase in the number of calls (to the city or the police) requesting something be done about homeless people near the caller’s home or work. The goal of the caller is often simple: to move homeless people from the caller’s visual field or simply to do something to get the homeless person to move. The police, in responding to these calls, rarely used any ‘law’. Instead, they used various techniques to move the homeless to different locations. Sometimes they just told homeless people to move, thus simply displacing the complaint. Or they would give homeless people bus tickets to another city if the recipient indicated they had a place to live elsewhere. Sometimes sanitation workers would be called in to power-wash the sidewalks (in order to get the homeless to move). Most of the homeless “feared the sanitation teams more than the police, due to the former’s ability to confiscate and destroy property, which was viewed as a punishment worse than arrest” (p. 787). The homeless people could also be taken to a hospital if there appeared to be some possible justification. Such actions also frequently resulted in homeless people losing all of their belongings., The loss of property was widespread: about half of the homeless interviewed as part of this study had lost vital possessions such as identification and benefit cards, medications, family photos and other priceless mementos.
Charging the homeless with some public order offence did occasionally occur. Given the frequency of contact the homeless had with police, a high portion of the homeless had been charged with at least one offence. The result of being charged, found guilty and fined was that, given that fines could not be paid, there were punitive civil consequences (e.g., being barred from services, housing and work)., Conclusion: Though “the trigger of complaint-oriented policing [of the homeless] is not rooted primarily under police command” (p. 793) and arrest and its consequences are not the source of the most important or frequent punishments, “this policing results in consistent punitive interactions with state officials that typically do not result in incarceration but nonetheless exact material, psychological, and social suffering” (p. 794)., Reference: Herring, Chris (2019).

"Between 1997 and 2015, Canada reduced its overall incarceration of youths by about 73%, mostly from a reduction in the number of youths in sentenced, not remand, custody. General lessons on how to reduce the use of prison might be gleaned by contrasting the successful decline in youth sentenced custody with the failure to reduce not only youth remand custody but also adult imprisonment.",", From at least as early as 1965, Canadian government reports on the treatment of young people who commit criminal offences suggested that the institutional commitment of youths should be held to a minimum. Nevertheless, it was not until the late 1990s that the decarceration of youths became a reality., In 1994, Canada’s Minister of Justice announced in Parliament that Canada’s youth justice laws had been unsuccessful in one of their important goals — reducing imprisonment. This acknowledgement began a legal and cultural process that would have a dramatic impact on youth incarceration. First, two national reviews of youth justice were held. Second, a policy paper was released that suggested a completely new youth justice law. Third, a new law was introduced into Parliament in 1999, coming into force 4 years later. By that time, those working in youth justice had been trained in a new way of thinking about the appropriate way to respond to offending by youths. And by differentiating violent cases from all other cases – suggesting, implicitly, that violent cases might be dealt with harshly – public opposition to the new approach was minimized., More importantly, perhaps, the ‘aspirational tone’ of previous youth legislation and policy (e.g., the use of incarceration should be minimized where appropriate) was replaced by more restrictive or directive language (e.g., custody can only be imposed if one of a number of fairly clearly defined conditions are met)., Youth incarceration rates began to decline in the late 1990s. The most dramatic decline, however, took place when Canada’s new youth justice legislation came into place in early 2003 (see Criminological Highlights 10(3)#1). What is perhaps more surprising is that sentenced custody rates for youths continued to decline in the years following the new legislation. “The most parsimonious explanation [for this latter decline] is that the new youth justice culture in Canada became increasingly more firmly entrenched or implanted” (p. 1112). The data demonstrate reductions at all stages of youth justice processing between 1998 and 2015: fewer incidents (especially non-violent incidents) were reported to the police; a smaller proportion of reported incidents resulted in charges; a lower proportion of cases in court resulted in findings of guilt; and a smaller proportion of those cases with a guilty finding resulted in a custodial sentence., Canadian governments have produced numerous reports suggesting that Canada imprisons too many adults and, indeed, Canadian legislation has aspirational language suggesting that imprisonment should be used as a last resort for adults. Similarly, in 2012, Canada introduced new language into its youth law in an apparent attempt to reduce the use of pretrial detention for youths. Notably, neither attempt was successful in part because they used “aspirational” rather than “operational” language; there was little attempt to change the (administrative) approach used by those working in the justice system; and governments appeared more ambivalent about what they wanted to accomplish in these areas., Conclusion: The dramatic reduction of youths in sentenced custody in Canada occurred as a result of at least three conditions: (1) Restraint in the use of incarceration was firmly embedded in Canadian criminal justice values; (2) There was clear political willingness to support change, and (3) The law was crafted to reduce the use of court and custody by explicitly structuring decisions through prescriptive provisions. It would appear that “Change is possible as long as we have the will to make it happen” (p. 1128)., Reference: Webster, Cheryl Marie, Jane B. Sprott, and Anthony N. Doob (2019).

"Jurors who convicted defendants were, in general, much less likely than judges to believe that deterrence should be the most important purpose guiding the sentencing of the defendant they convicted.",", The Victoria, Australia, Sentencing Act (1991) instructs judges that the sentences they impose must reflect one or more of the standard sentencing purposes: deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation, just punishment and/or denunciation. Said differently, in general, judges are given little statutory guidance on the purpose that should guide the sentence but are generally given discretion in deciding on the purposes that should be the focus in each case., This study looks at the views of Victoria jurors of the sentencing of the defendant whom they convicted. Because jury service is compulsory in Victoria and exemptions are few, jurors are likely to be representative of the local community. Hence it can be seen as a study of the views of sentencing of ordinary citizens who have a detailed and intimate understanding of a criminal case., After arriving at a guilty verdict, jurors were asked to indicate what they thought the sentence should be (see Criminological Highlights 16(5)#3) and then were asked to indicate which of 7 possible alternatives was the ‘single most important purpose’ that would be achieved by their sentence. (Previous research has suggested that when asked to rate the importance of each purpose, many people simply rate all of them as being important.) Data were collected from jurors who had participated in 124 trials in Victoria. Most cases were relatively serious: 71% of the cases involved sex or violence offences., The judges’ sentencing remarks were also coded on a four-point scale of how important the judge indicated each purpose was in the case at hand. Finally, a subset of jurors was interviewed., 48% of the jurors (pooling across all types of cases) saw denunciation or retribution as the single most important purpose. These were seen as being more important than any of the other five purposes (specific or general deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation or compensation). The interviews, as well, “revealed that juror preferences were dominated by a desire to communicate censure, to construct a meaningful response to offending or to send a message to the offender and society.” Deterrence (specific or general) was not seen as being very important., In the most serious cases, jurors were more inclined than in other cases to list incapacitation as the most important purpose (20.6% vs. 10.5% for the other cases). Only in drug offences did a substantial portion of people list general deterrence (38%) as the most important purpose. For the most part, however, jurors wanted sentences to reflect denunciation and retribution rather than the traditional utilitarian purposes (deterrence and incapacitation)., Judges saw things differently. Their reasons for sentencing were coded by the researchers. General deterrence was the purpose most likely to be identified as the single predominant purpose and it was also the purpose most likely to be described as being important or very important in determining the sentence. Said differently: “General deterrence was at the top of the list for judges but at the bottom for most groups of jurors” (p. 34). In the interviews, jurors suggested such things as “people don’t think about the consequences” (p. 35) or that people aren’t aware of penalties., Conclusion: The results were similar to other survey findings suggesting that ordinary citizens want offenders to get “the punishment they deserve” (p. 37). The results are also similar to survey findings in Canada (Criminological Highlights 8(6)#1) in which deterrence was ranked a distant fifth most important factor in sentencing. Perhaps more interesting is that jurors’ skepticism that crime can be deterred by way of sentencing is more in line with empirical research (Criminological Highlights Collection on our website) than were judges’ sentencing decisions., Reference: Warner, Kate, Julia Davis, Caroline Spiranovic, Helen Cockburn, and Arie Freiberg (2019).

"Black Americans with dark skin tones are more likely than lighter-skinned Black Americans to be arrested and incarcerated even when a set of standard control factors (e.g., childhood delinquency, education, neighbourhood crime rates) are taken into account.",", Recent data suggests that within the Black American community, skin tone predicts various outcomes including education, income, occupation and health. Darker-skinned African Americans are disadvantaged more than lighter-skinned African Americans., Previous death penalty research has shown, for example, that “even after controlling for relevant factors, the more stereotypically Black a defendant was perceived to be (i.e., darker skin tone and more Afrocentric facial features), the more likely that Black defendant was to be sentenced to death” (p. 1596). This paper uses a national study of African Americans to investigate the likelihood of arrest and incarceration of people with a range of different skin tones., The analyses presented in the paper use data for native-born US Blacks, age 18 and over, who participated in a national survey. The main outcome variables are whether the respondent had ever been arrested and whether the respondent had been incarcerated. The main independent variable – coded by Black interviewers for the Black respondents – was the rating, on a 7-point scale, of the skin tone of the interviewee. Overall, 33% had been arrested at least once., Black respondents with darker skin tone were more likely to be arrested than were those with lighter skin tone. This relationship was reduced slightly when various control factors were added such as educational attainment, a poverty measure, neighbourhood crime, drug use, childhood delinquency. Of course, it is possible that some of these ‘control’ factors (e.g., educational attainment, poverty) are partially a function of skin tone., The survey also collected data from white (non-Hispanic) Americans living in equivalent neighbourhoods. The likelihood of being arrested for the lightest-skinned Blacks is roughly the same as for whites as a whole. But overall, “whites who tend to live in neighbourhoods with African Americans are still significantly less likely to be arrested than African Americans” (p. 1603). The difference, however, between the likelihood of ever having been arrested for Black vs. white Americans is less than the difference between the likelihood of having been arrested for the lightest- vs. darkest-skinned African Americans., Given the results on arrest, it is not surprising that skin tone also predicts whether the respondent had ever been incarcerated. “The lighter-skinned African Americans have mean incarceration levels that are indistinguishable from that of whites. Those at the darker end of the spectrum, however, have significantly higher mean incarcerations levels… than both the lightest-skinned African Americans and whites” (p. 1605-6)., Conclusion: “There is… mounting evidence that life chances among African Americans are internally stratified by gradational differences in their skin tone – a form of inequality and stratification that is missed by conventional analyses that use dichotomous… ‘race’ categories…. While being black (and poor) may already predispose one to have a higher probability of contact with the criminal justice system and harsher treatment [by it] (for a wide array of reasons), being perceived as blacker intensifies this contact further and may increase the harshness of one’s treatment by the criminal justice system as an institution” (p. 1606). However, as the authors themselves point out, one should be cautious about assuming, on the basis of this one study, causal links between variation in skin colour among African Americans and treatment by the criminal justice system., Reference: Monk, Ellis P.

"Successful reintegration of people imprisoned for serious and/or violent offences is impeded by physical and mental health problems that they experience in prison. These health problems have negative effects largely through their indirect impacts on employment, family conflict, or financial problems experienced after release.",", People who are incarcerated are likely to experience health problems. This study examines the impact of physical and mental health states immediately before release on prisoners after they are released from prison. In addition, it attempts to understand how the health status of a recently released prisoner might impact reintegration by looking at possible mediating mechanisms (employment, family conflict, and financial problems)., Most prisoners even in the US eventually are released back into the community. This study examines data on 1,532 men who were released from prisons in 12 US states after spending an average of about 2.5 years incarcerated., Prisoners were interviewed three times: approximately 30 days before release, and 3 and 9 months after release. Health data consisted of self-reports of whether there were any problems with normal mobility and activities as well as experience with pain. Depression was measured with feelings of loneliness, having no interest in things, feeling fearful, feeling hopeless, etc. Not surprisingly, physical health had a direct impact on depression., After release, family conflict and employment were measured three months after release; and self-reported financial problems were assessed 9 months after release. Self-reported involvement in crime was measured 9 months after release with 6 items measuring involvement in violent, drug, property and other crimes. Various other control measures (e.g., age, education, prior arrests and incarceration) were also included in the statistical models. Reincarceration data (15 months after release) were obtained from state and federal administrative data., Poor physical health was directly related to being unemployed. And being unemployed three months after release was directly related to increased crime at 9 months. Experiencing depression and being unemployed were each independently linked to increased likelihood of family conflict 3 months after release. Those experiencing family conflict were more likely to report financial problems. Those with financial problems were more likely than others to report involvement in crime. Those involved in crime at 9 months (as well as those experiencing financial problems at 9 months) were, not surprisingly, more likely to be incarcerated at 15 months., In summary, then, “Physical health limitations led to increased crime through their impact on employment” (p. 560), and depression was linked with crime through its effect on family conflict (which in turn was linked directly with crime and indirectly with crime through its impact on financial problems)., Conclusion: “The present research findings implicate both physical and mental health for reentry success and recidivism” (p. 562). Physical health issues “compromise one’s ability to secure and maintain employment” (p. 562), but poor physical health has an independent impact on depression which has its own negative impact on reentry success through its association with increased family conflict. In other words, prisoners who are released with physical and mental health challenges are more likely to commit offences and return to prison. “The findings underscore the need for policies and programs that improve health during incarceration and obviate health-related failures after release” (p. 567)., Reference: Link, Nathan W., Jeffrey T.

Ordinary people are able to overcome their negative views of people with criminal records if they are given information about the person from a previous employer who indicates a willingness to rehire the former offender if given an opportunity to do so.,", It is well established that people with a criminal record have difficulty getting employment and housing (Criminological Highlights 6(3)#2, 15(1)#7, 16(4)#7, 17(2)#6). At the same time, stable employment and housing contribute to the crime-free reintegration into society of those with criminal records., This paper examines the way in which the stigmatizing effect of a criminal record might be overcome. It provides evidence supporting the conclusion that “By contextualizing the criminal record as just one piece of information about the person, decisionmakers can more accurately assess the ‘whole person’ in their review” (p. 3) and be less influenced by this one negative fact., In this study, ordinary participants in an online US survey were given a description of a hypothetical job applicant and were asked to indicate their willingness, if they were looking for employees, to call back this applicant for a job interview. The ‘job applicant’ varied on a number of dimensions. The applicant was described as having had no criminal record or as having been imprisoned for 18 months for a drug felony or a violent felony.
If the hypothetical applicant had a record, some survey respondents were given no special job-related information about the applicant. Other applicants were described as having participated in a job skills program voluntarily or as a requirement while in prison. Another group of applicants was described as having a state license (as a barber) implying that the state had determined that he was rehabilitated enough to be employed in a profession that involved contact with the public. The final group was described as having a favourable reference letter from a previous employer (prior to the imprisonment) indicating that the job applicant had been a good worker and that notwithstanding the felony conviction, the employer would be willing to rehire him if he had the opportunity to do so., Consistent with other research, people were considerably less likely to indicate a willingness to call back a job applicant with a criminal record (drug or violent felony) than they were a person with no criminal record. Having a reference letter from a previous employer, however, removed most, but not all, of the stigmatizing effect of the criminal record. People were substantially more likely to call back a person with a record if they had a positive reference letter from a previous employer than if the applicant had a record but did not have such a letter. It did not, however, eliminate the effect of a criminal record: respondents indicated that they were somewhat less likely to call them back than they would similar people without a criminal record., Having participated, as a prisoner, in voluntary job training seemed to have a small impact in overcoming the stigma of a criminal record but was not as effective as an independent source of information about the character of the former prisoner apparently written by a former employer., For respondents who indicated that they had been in a position to review job applications and conduct job interviews, the results were quite similar, although the only thing that appeared to mitigate the impact of a criminal record was the reference letter from the previous employer. The results also were generally similar for applicants regardless of whether they were apparently Black or White., Conclusion: Overcoming the stigmatizing impact of a criminal record is difficult especially in an age in which many criminal records are accessible to those who search the internet. This study suggests, however, that personal information from an employer indicating a willingness to rehire a former prisoner can overcome much of the negative impact of contact with the criminal justice system., Reference: DeWitt, Samuel E. and Megan Denver (2019).

"Segregation of neighbourhoods in US metropolitan areas “plays a fundamental role in explaining black-white disparities in violent crime”: the more segregated metropolitan areas are, the larger the difference between black and white homicide rates. Nevertheless, “the more integrated metropolitan areas also tend to have considerably lower overall rates of homicide victimization” (p. 710).",", It has been suggested that whites benefit from segregation by having a reduced risk of violent victimization. This study examines whether “changes in segregation [in 103 major US metropolitan areas] between 1970 and 2010 influenced the prevalence of homicide for both whites and blacks” (p. 691)., The main explanatory variable of interest in the study is an index that estimates the degree of segregation of blacks and whites within a metropolitan area at a given point in time. In addition, a number of other control variables – measured separately for blacks and whites – were included in the analysis. These included such factors as income, unemployment rates, and residential instability. For the metropolitan area as a whole, the overall percent black, incarceration rate, and police per capita were also controlled for. Data were obtained at five points in time (1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010) – years when census data were collected., Without controls, homicide rates for blacks were highest in the most segregated cities. White homicide rates were considerably lower. When controls were added to the model, it was clear there was substantial variation in black and white homicide rates across time. But in addition, there is a substantial positive relationship between increased segregation and black homicide rates. Given that the analysis controlled for various measures of black disadvantage, it would appear that high levels of segregation are associated with high rates of black homicide victimization. This effect was found above and beyond control variables such as poverty levels., For whites, however, controlling for black and white poverty, residential stability, etc., the higher the degree of segregation of the city at any given point in time, the lower the white homicide rate., Since, controlling for other factors, black homicide goes up, and white homicide goes down with increased segregation in a given metropolitan area, it would appear that “African Americans bear the brunt of … [high levels of racial segregation in] neighborhoods, while whites benefit from spatially concentrating social problems in [black] communities” (p. 703-4). Other analyses suggest “that the segregation-homicide link is not driven solely by selective migration patterns into and out of segregated places that simultaneously determine segregation and crime. [Instead]… the results… provide strong causal evidence that the maintenance of segregation does indeed benefit whites, at least in terms of reduced risk of homicide victimization” (p. 708)., Conclusion: The “findings buttress arguments that segregation plays a fundamental role in explaining black-white disparities in violent crime…. The black-white homicide [rate] gap in the least segregated metro areas is a fraction of the gap in the most segregated areas” (p. 710). “Reduced exposure to violence may help explain why whites continue to remain highly segregated from blacks. This privilege that whites enjoy, however, is purchased at tremendous cost to African Americans in terms of increased homicide” (p. 712)., Reference: Light, Michael T. and Julia T. Thomas (2019).

Children of fathers who were incarcerated when the child was very young are more likely than similar children whose fathers were not imprisoned to be suspended or expelled from elementary school.,", The incarceration of a parent has a variety of negative impacts on their children. These include, among other things such problems as increased likelihood of offending by the children, lower educational achievement, higher levels of aggressiveness, and lower earnings as a young adult (see Criminological Highlights 1(1)#6, 10(3)#2, 12(5)#1, 12(6)#7, 13(1)#7), 14(2)#1, 16(2)#1, 16(4)#8, 16(6)#8)., This paper extends this line of research by looking at the impact of the incarceration of a youth’s father early in the youth’s life on that child’s elementary school experience. It examines whether some of the other negative impacts of the incarceration of a parent have their roots in the early school experiences of the child. Other studies have suggested that the experience of punishment in school (e.g., suspension from school) is associated with later criminal justice involvement., This paper uses data from the “Fragile Families Study” – a longitudinal study of a cohort of children born between 1998 and 2000. The survey over-represents socioeconomically disadvantaged families. This study uses data obtained from the parents from the time of the birth of the child to age 9 as well as data obtained from the child in later years. The focus is on the impact of the incarceration of a parent before the child turned 5 years old. The main outcome measure was whether the child reported that they had ever been suspended or expelled from school by age 9. A total of 50 control variables (e.g., neighbourhood, family structure, parental and school measures) was used to ensure that comparisons between children who had a parent incarcerated and those who did not were, in general, similar on other relevant characteristics., Three different statistical approaches were used to ensure that differences between children whose fathers were incarcerated before the child turned 5 and those whose father had not been incarcerated could reasonably be attributable to the incarceration of the father. These techniques of creating equivalent groups were important because, without these controls, there were, not surprisingly, important differences between the children who experienced an incarcerated father and those who did not., The analyses — using various approaches for controlling for other factors — led to very similar findings. Controlling for other differences, the odds of school punishment (suspension or expulsion) by the time the child turned 9 were considerably higher for children whose fathers were incarcerated than the odds of school punishment were for similarly placed children who did not have an imprisoned father., An independent confirmation that this effect was apparently caused by the incarceration of the parent (and not other factors) came from an analysis of school punishment for those children whose father did not live with the mother and child. When the various controls were put in place (in effect comparing comparable children whose ‘non-residential’ father was or was not incarcerated) there was no effect of the incarceration of the parent. In other words, only when the criminal justice system took the father out of the home was there a negative impact of paternal incarceration. If he wasn’t in the home to begin with, incarcerating the father had no measurable impact on whether the child was subsequently suspended or expelled from school., Other analyses suggested that some, but not all, of the association between the incarceration of the father and school suspension or expulsion is due to behavior problems on the part of the child (various types of offending) and weakened social bonds of the child with the family., Conclusion: There is a substantial amount of research suggesting that incarceration has harmful effects on the person imprisoned. Other research suggests incarceration has negative impacts on those associated with the prisoner. This paper extends these findings by demonstrating that the very early incarceration of the father –before the child turns five — has negative impacts on youths’ experiences in school before the child is nine years old., Reference: Jacobsen, Wade C.

"Offenders convicted of violent offences who were sentenced by ‘tough’ judges were equally likely to commit further offences as were those who, on the basis of a random process, were sentenced by more ‘lenient’ judges.","There is a substantial amount of research that concludes that harsh sentences do not deter the person sentenced from future offending nor do harsh sentences act as a deterrent to others in the community.  For example, one study (Criminological Highlights 11(4)#2)  demonstrated that the reoffending rates of those convicted of drug felonies were the same whether they were randomly assigned to be sentenced by a harsh or a lenient judge., This study takes advantage of the fact that between 2003 and 2006 cases were randomly assigned to Michigan judges. Eliminating those cases which, for various reasons, were not randomly assigned, as well as the cases in which judges had no discretion on the use of prison vs. probation, this study examines the 1-, 3-, and 5-year outcomes of being sentenced by harsh or lenient judges. Various case characteristics as well as the county in which a person was being sentenced were controlled for in order to detect potentially small effects of sentencing variation across cases., A very important challenge is to address when the ‘recidivism period’ starts.  If the period begins at sentencing, then the ‘three year recidivism’ measure means that people sentenced to probation have 3 years of opportunity to reoffend in the community.   People sentenced to 1 year in prison, on the other hand, have only two years of opportunity to offend in the community if the recidivism measure starts at sentencing., For this reason, two separate ‘start times’ were considered: “time since sentence” and “time since release”.  In the latter case, people given prison and non-prison sentences have an equal opportunity to offend. The study was focused on violent crime after sentence or after the release from prison for the original offence.  Two groups were examined: those whose original case involved at least one violent offence, and those without any violent offences included in their original case., The results were consistent across recidivism periods and similar for those with and without a violent offence in the original conviction., Looking at ‘time since release from prison’ there was no effect of prison vs. probation for arrest or conviction at either 1-, 3-, or 5-years since release., However, if one looks at “time since sentence”, not surprisingly, those who had been sentenced to prison were less likely to be arrested or convicted.  This, quite obviously, is an effect of incapacitation:  while in prison, those sentenced to prison rather than probation had no opportunity to offend., Conclusion: Although the findings show a short-term incapacitation effect (while in prison a person is precluded from offending in the community), this ‘benefit’ is short-lived.  As soon as a person is released, they commit offences at the rate they would have had they had the opportunity to do so.  Said differently “imprisonment did not prevent post-release violence in the community” (p. 674).  It simply delayed its occurrence.  The results “suggest that imprisoning fewer people for violent offences on the margin between prison and probation would have relatively small effects on violence in the community, and that alternative policies and interventions to prevent violence may show greater benefit at reduced social and economic costs” (p. 675)., Reference: Harding, David J., J.

"A comparison of police clearance rates of gun murders and gunshot assaults demonstrates that the amount of resources police invest in their investigations makes a difference. Gun murders are more likely to be solved than assaults because the police invest more resources in investigating them. The more resources that are invested in timely investigations of serious violent crime, the more likely they are to be solved.",", “Fatal and nonfatal gunshot assaults are similar with respect to victim characteristics and circumstances, yet the clearance-by-arrest rates tend to be considerably higher for fatal cases” (p. 525).  This paper examines the hypothesis that the difference in clearance rates is due largely to the priority that is given, by police departments, to fatal cases., A representative sample of case data where one or more people were killed or wounded with a firearm in a criminal incident between 2010 and 2014 in Boston, Massachusetts were examined. Most (83%) were deemed by the Boston police to be the results of gang- or drug-related disputes.   Cases in which the main suspect was dead were excluded., The clearance rate for completed homicides was about twice that of non-fatal cases (40% vs. 19%).  Fatal and non-fatal gun crimes were the same on most dimensions (e.g., gang/drug vs. other, number of victims, age, gender and criminal record of the victims).  The one dimension in which they differed was that shootings that took place indoors were more likely to be fatal (perhaps because the distance between shooter and victim was less than outdoor shootings)., Holding the characteristics and circumstances of the shooting constant, fatal shootings were still considerably more likely to be cleared.  The clearance rates in the first week or so after the shootings were almost identical.   However, after the first week, few additional people were ever charged in non-fatal shootings.  In fatal shootings, however, the proportion of cases cleared continued to increase up to a year after the shooting took place., Six categories of crime scene evidence (e.g., witnesses interviewed, computer checks) were examined.  The average amount of evidence gathered for fatal cases was much higher – typically twice as high – than for non-fatal crimes.  The exception was whether any firearms were recovered. Few were recovered and there was no difference between fatal and non-fatal shootings on this one measure. Generally, when one looks at police actions subsequent to the initial investigation (e.g., ballistic tests, DNA, search warrants executed), it was clear that the police concentrated efforts more on fatal than non-fatal shootings., Conclusion: “Given that fatal and nonfatal cases occur in similar circumstances, the greater volume of evidence collected in fatal cases was likely the direct result of extra investigative resources” (p. 543).  And greater investigative resources appeared to be linked to higher numbers of suspects being identified.  Obviously, the results of one carefully executed study cannot definitively explain the difference in the clearance rates between these two types of cases.  However, “If it is true that most of the clearance-rate gap between fatal and nonfatal cases is a result of the extra resources that police departments commit to homicides, then it should be possible to increase arrest rate for nonfatal shooting cases greatly by giving them near-equal priority to homicides” (p. 544)., Reference: Cook, Philip J., Anthony A.

A study of Black youths’ lack of cooperation with police in their investigations of gun violence suggests that little will change until the police regain the confidence of the community.,", When an urban shooting of a Black person takes place, police will often “decry the lack of eyewitnesses willing to come forward with valuable information” (p. 624).  It needs to be noted, however, that “the code of silence is not unique to distressed communities of colour” (p. 626)., This paper reports the results of interviews with 50 young Black men (age 18-29) in New York City who had extensive experience with gun violence. Gun violence in the US is concentrated in disadvantaged communities of colour.  Drug and gang related shootings are especially unlikely to be solved., The young men who were interviewed lived in neighbourhoods with violent crime rates much higher than in other parts of the city. Most (94%) had a friend or family member who had been shot at.  74% reported having been shot at themselves., Lack of cooperation with the police was explained by these young men as reflecting their views of local police. For example, some reported having been threatened or harassed by the police for non-criminal matters.  More than half pointed to “widely publicized instances of officer misconduct [e.g., fatal police shootings of unarmed Black men] as justification for their entrenched mistrust [of the police]” (p. 633).  Many noted that the police appeared to concentrate on arresting people in their neighbourhoods for low level crime rather than concentrating on matters (e.g., violence) of concern to most people.   Citing apparent poor performance in arresting people for violent acts in their own neighbourhood, the young men suggested that the police didn’t care what happened to them or their friends. The result of these views was clear: 90% of the respondents indicated they would not call the police even if they or a loved one were threatened with gun violence., Lacking confidence in the police, many (90%) indicated that concerns about violence influenced their decisions to carry guns themselves.  Not surprisingly, then, most (92% of those interviewed) “preferred self-help in the form of retaliatory violence over cooperating with police after shootings” (p. 637).  As one respondent put it, the police are “not here to help me. They just want to take somebody down, put somebody away” (p. 638)., Most (88%) of the respondents understood that they would face lengthy prison terms if arrested with a gun and were concerned about that possibility.  At the same time, they felt that the known risks of being caught with a gun were outweighed by perceived victimization risks if they weren’t armed.  One stated the tradeoff in stark terms: “A prison cell is better than a coffin” (p. 640)., Conclusion: Given that it is broadly thought to be in the public interest for there to be cooperation between the community and the police on solving and avoiding gun violence, it would seem that the first moves have to be with the police.  Putting extra resources into solving nonfatal shootings (see Criminological Highlights 18(2)#2) might be one way of demonstrating concern with violence in high crime areas.  But more generally, it would appear that the lack of cooperation of those most likely to be victimized in disadvantaged neighbourhoods relates to the manner in which the police are perceived.  Addressing that is likely to require fundamental changes in the manner in which policing of these neighbourhoods takes place., Reference: Brunson, Rod K.  and Brian A.

"Families help reduce substance abuse and reoffending by prisoners who are returning to the community by providing them with advice or assistance with financial matters, housing, and jobs.",", Previous research has highlighted family support as a key component to successful reentry of former prisoners into the community. This paper identifies the key elements of family support that are responsible for reducing reoffending, substance use, and reincarceration in a sample of 1,002 serious and violent prisoners released to the community., There are two broad categories of help that families might give people returning to the community from prison.  Families can provide “emotional support characterized by love, warmth and affection.” But in addition, they can provide “instrumental support like financial resources, transportation, or housing” (p. 485).  These are obviously quite different and it is possible that both types of support, or only one, is important in accounting for the relationship between family support and successful integration., This study, using data from the “Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative,” collected data from prisoners in the month prior to release as well as at three points in time after release (3, 9, and 15 months post-release).  Data from the offenders as well as from state agencies were used. Three outcome measures were examined: reincarceration data (from the state agencies), self-reported drug use, and self-reported offending.  Instrumental support was assessed with responses to such questions as “I have someone in my family to provide help or advice finding a job” or “I have someone in my family to provide transportation to work/appointments” (p. 496).  Emotional support and interactional support were assessed with questions such as “I have someone in my family to talk to who understands my problems” or “I feel close to my family” (p. 496)., Various controls were also included in the analyses, including contact during incarceration with the family, family conflict, the family’s involvement in the criminal justice system, criminal peers, criminal history, length of incarceration, age, and race., The results were consistent across outcome measures.  Emotional and interactional support were not related to reincarceration, substance use, or self-reported criminal behaviour.  On the other hand, high levels of instrumental support (an index giving high weights to direct help and advice with accommodation, transportation, and employment) were associated with decreased reincarceration,  self-reported substance use, and self-reported criminal offending.  Said differently, “affectionate-type bonds do not significantly relate to reincarceration, substance use, or offending during the reentry process” (p. 510).  But practical support does have a positive impact on prisoners who are returning to the community., Conclusion:  This study examined the reentry process of serious and violent prisoners in the US who had an average of about 6 prior convictions.  They had been incarcerated for an average of 2.5 years prior to being released into the community. Instrumental support, but not emotional support, from families appears to reduce subsequent offending, reincarceration and drug use.  The problem, of course, is that many families are not capable of providing this type of support.  One suggestion is that people who are released from prison whose families cannot provide instrumental support would benefit from instrumental support either from criminal justice agencies or from other community groups., Reference: Mowen, Thomas J., Richard Stansfield, and John H.

"A study of over 7,000 people convicted of sex offences in 8 countries demonstrates that after about 10-15 years, most individuals with a history of sexual crimes are very unlikely to commit another sex offence.  Risk of reoffending decreases dramatically with time for all age groups of offenders and for people who, when released, were originally identified as either being high or low risk to reoffend.",", This paper examines the data relevant to the belief that those convicted of a sex offence present an enduring risk to society even after many years of crime-free living in the community. In Canada, for example, people convicted of a single sex offence involving a child are never eligible for a pardon., The belief that those once convicted of a sex offence are forever dangerous goes against the conclusion that “The general tendency for recidivism risk to decline over time is among the most replicated results in empirical criminology” (p. 49).   In general, long-term follow-up studies of sexual recidivism find that the highest rates of reoffending are in the years immediately following release into the community.   As with any recidivism study, it is impossible to measure “offending” directly; what can be measured are charges or convictions.   This study examines the long-term criminal justice indicators of sexual offending of those once convicted of a sex offence., Data were gathered from 20 studies carried out in 8 countries. The studies examined reoffending by convicted sex offenders after their release back into the community. Recidivism of those in the community was calculated in 6 month intervals starting with release into the community. In some samples, people were followed for up to 25 years., Over time, the likelihood of sexual recidivism dropped dramatically from about 3% in the first 6 months to close to zero after 25 years.   Across time, of course, the overall proportion of the sample who reoffended increased from 9.1% of the sample at 5 years to 18.5% in 25 years., Putting these two sets of findings together is important: While 13.2% of the sample committed a sexual offence in the first 10 years, only 4.9% reoffended in the next decade.   Furthermore, the relative risk reduction over time was similar for those originally estimated to be either high or low risk to reoffend.  The results also hold for offenders of all ages.  Even when looking at the higher risk group, most (about 80%) were never reconvicted of another sexual offence. And if they did reoffend, they tended to reoffend soon after being released back into the community., It appears that “there is wide variability in recidivism risk for individuals with a history of sexual crime; risk probability declines over time; and risk can be very low – so low, in fact, that it becomes indistinguishable from the rate of spontaneous sexual offences for individuals with no history of sexual crime but who have a history of nonsexual crime” (p. 58)., Conclusion: Given the well-documented decline over time in the likelihood that a person convicted of a sexual crime reoffends sexually, the special restrictions placed – sometimes forever – on those once convicted of sex offences need to be reevaluated. If these restrictions are based on actual risk, it would make sense for there to be an opportunity for reassessment in a timely fashion.  “Any public protection policy that does not allow for diminished risk over time should be immediately suspect” (p. 58).  Furthermore, “there should be an upper limit to the absolute duration of public protection measures” such as restrictions on pardons, requirements of registration and notification, as well as restrictions related to residence, education and employment.  “If the goal is increased public protection (not retribution or punishment) then efficient policies would be proportional to the risk presented” (p. 59) — a risk that declines dramatically with time., Reference: Hanson, R.

The video recording of interrogations of suspects in ordinary criminal cases does not appear to affect the content or the outcome of those interrogations nor does it appear to have any impact on the outcome of the cases.,", False confessions are an important contributing factor to wrongful convictions.  “Perhaps the most significant proposed safeguard [to preserve the integrity of the interrogation] is to require the electronic recording of interrogations – the entire process, not just the confession” (p. 46).  This is done in some jurisdictions, but not others. Concern has been expressed that if suspects know they are being videotaped during interrogations, the police will not be as successful in obtaining relevant information., About half of US jurisdictions require full recording of custodial interrogations. This paper examines whether telling suspects that their interrogation is being recorded makes a difference to the outcome of the case.  The police in one US city allowed researchers to randomly tell about half of a sample of 122 suspects that their interrogation was being recorded with a hidden camera. The other half were told nothing about the recording (which in all cases actually took place using a hidden camera).   In most of the cases, the lead detective did not know whether the suspect had been informed or not of the experimental condition.  All suspects were adults; their crimes involved everything from prank phone calls and disorderly conduct to robbery, felony assault, and counterfeiting.  Cases involving homicide, drugs or juveniles were excluded from the study., The interrogations were then coded by independent researchers. On none of the various dependent measures related to the success or quality of the interrogation was there a difference between suspects who were made aware they were being recorded and those who were not.  Dependent measures included:  Interrogation length, invoking the right to silence or the right to a lawyer, the likelihood of denying guilt or making an acknowledgement of guilt, implicating someone else, or providing crime relevant or crime-irrelevant details., The detectives rated the suspects as equally talkative and cooperative in the two conditions.   Of the cases that had been resolved within 14 months after the data were collected, there was no difference in the outcome between the two conditions.  “Suspects exhibited little awareness or concern about the presence of a camera…. [None] refused or expressed a reluctance to proceed because of being recorded” (p. 52)., Conclusion:  Although there were no differences between those suspects who were told that their interrogation was being recorded and those who were not told, most suspects, at some point in the interrogation, denied involvement in the crime.  However, at some point in the interrogation, many suspects made some kind of remark that could be self-incriminating.  Once again, however, it did not matter whether the suspect had been told that their interrogation was being recorded.  It is suggested that the results should allay fears that telling suspects that their interrogations will be recorded will affect the outcome of those interrogations., Reference: Kassin, Saul M., Melissa B.

The use of solitary confinement in American prison systems “has remained in use at the deep end of punishment for more than two centuries” (p. 1605) even though it has been repeatedly criticized and reinvented with some variations under a variety of names.,", The question raised by this paper is a simple one. Though the practice of solitary confinement has been denounced “as an immoral and inhumane punishment” and “forceful calls for reform” (p. 1605) have been repeatedly made, why does it persist?, Part of the answer to this question may relate to the fact that the stated purpose of solitary confinement has shifted over time.  In its earliest incarnation in the 1790s and early 1800s, solitary confinement was seen as having a number of quite different purposes in dealing with offenders: to keep them from influencing other prisoners, to encourage prisoners to follow the rules and to allow time for reflection and reformation.  Total solitary confinement, however, was, by the 1820s seen as too expensive and interfering with prison labour which, by then, was seen as both a cost-saver and an essential ingredient of prisoner reformation., By the end of the 19th century, two justifications for solitary confinement had emerged: prisoner reformation and punishment (for disorderly behaviour).  At two of the best-known US prisons of that period “prison administrators… responded to critiques [of solitary confinement] by repeatedly refining the quality and quantity of their isolation practices” (p. 1618).  Though in the 20th century, long-term solitary confinement was seen as unacceptable, it remained in use, though its duration was, in some instances, limited by court decisions., In the latter part of the 20th century, the use of solitary confinement continued with the dual justifications of order maintenance and discipline.  However, other forms of isolation developed over time: Long-term “lockdowns” of all prisoners and the building of “supermax” prisons in which prisoners spent 22-23 hours a day in their cells with minimal human contact. But the term “solitary confinement” was not typically applied to these institutions.  Instead they were described as, for example, a “Security Housing Unit” (p. 1624).   Similar institutions were built in other countries., Conclusion: “While some justifications for [the use of solitary confinement] varied, its appeal to prison administrators as a technology of control was omnipresent…. Solitary confinement persisted at least in part because of its ability to satisfy administrative goals like institutional control” (p. 1626).  “Modern penal officials insist that they are not using solitary confinement, seeking to differentiate themselves from widely condemned practices… In other words [they] want to distance themselves from something that was perceived as inordinately harsh and to argue that they are imposing something more civilized ….  In light of this history, the total abolition of solitary confinement … seems unlikely, absent broader changes to the structure of incarceration, and especially the control that prison administrators wield” (p. 1627)., Reference: Rubin, Ashley T. and Keramet Reiter (2018).

Police officers who score high in their acceptance of ‘rape myths’ when given a description of a rape rate women as more responsible and men as less responsible for the outcome than police officers who score low in their acceptance of rape myths.  Those who accept rape myths are also less likely to describe the event as a rape.,", Rape myths are typically defined as “descriptive or prescriptive beliefs about rape – its causes, content, consequences, [as well as the] perpetrators, victims, and their interaction – that serve to deny, downplay, or justify sexual violence that men commit against women.”  In this paper, English police officers’ acceptance of rape myths was assessed. They were then asked to respond to vignettes that clearly met the legal definition of rape in England., Studies of police officers in the US and England suggest that “a substantial minority of officers exhibit some level of agreement” with statements such as “any victim can resist a rape if they want to” (p. 101).  The earlier studies suggest that officers’ views of how a victim should behave and what a rape should look like affect their judgements of particular fact situations., In this study, 808 police officers in the London, England, police service, representing a variety or ranks and ethnicities, were given a 30-item questionnaire in which they indicated their agreement with statements such as “Many women tend to misinterpret a well-meant gesture as a sexual assault” and “A lot of women strongly complain about sexual infringements for no real reason, just to appear emancipated.”   Officers were also given one of 16 vignettes describing the details of a rape.  These varied according to victim-perpetrator relationship (stranger, acquaintance, partner, ex-partner), victim reputation (good, bad), and initial point of resistance (early, late).  Officers were characterized (divided at the median) as being either high or low in rape myth acceptance., After reading one of the 16 vignettes, each officer was asked three questions assessing victim responsibility for what happened, one question on perpetrator’s responsibility, and one question on whether the scenario qualified as an authentic rape., ‘Good’ victims were seen as having less responsibility for the rape than were ‘bad’ victims. Similarly, those victims who resisted early were seen as having less responsibility than those who resisted later. Perpetrators were seen as having more responsibility when the victim resisted early in the interaction., Compared to officers who did not accept rape myths, officers high in rape myth acceptance saw victims as being more responsible for what happened to them. Those officers high in rape myth acceptance saw perpetrators as having less responsibility than did those low in rape myth acceptance.  More generally, the interaction described in the vignette was less likely to be rated as an authentic rape by those high in rape myth acceptance., Conclusion: The results are quite straightforward: officers high in rape myth acceptance see descriptions of rape differently from those with lower rape myth acceptance.  The former group are less likely to view the event as a rape, seeing the victim as more responsible and the perpetrators as less responsible than do police officers who do not believe rape myths. It appears that those who accept rape myths rely, to some extent, on these beliefs when assessing the parties and the events in question.  Findings such as these suggest that it is important, when selecting officers to investigate sexual assaults, to avoid choosing officers whose starting point is skepticism about the existence of rape and other sexual assaults., Reference: Hine, Benjamin and Anthony Murphy (2019).  The Influence of ‘High’ vs. ‘Low’ Rape Myth Acceptance on Police Officers’ Judgements of Victim and Perpetrator Responsibility, and Rape Authenticity.  Journal of Criminal Justice, 60, 100-107., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV18N2.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-18-no-2-%E2%80%93-september-2019,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 18, No. 2 – September 2019",Regular Issue,2019
Expungement of criminal records leads to increased employment.,"Canadian data (Criminological Highlights 15(2)#6) suggest that the majority of those applying for pardons in Canada do so for reasons related to employment.   This study examines the actual effects of the sealing of criminal records in Michigan on the employment of those whose records were sealed., At least 36 of the 50 US states have provisions that allow records of adult convictions to be sealed, set aside, or expunged. The laws generally give the person the right to answer “No” to questions about criminal records from employers and landlords. The details of these provisions (e.g., in terms of which offences are covered by the legislation) vary widely as do the waiting periods.  In some cases, employers or landlords who might know, independently, of a (pardoned) criminal conviction, are prohibited from using that information in their decisions.  Perhaps the most interesting statute is Pennsylvania’s 2018 law, which received broad legislative and citizen support.  It created an automatic computerized process for sealing certain eligible records after a specified period of time without a subsequent conviction. However, it applies only to minor offences., Between 1983 and 2011, Michigan’s law allowed applicants to apply to have a single criminal conviction ‘set aside’ after 5 crime-free years.  Though the breadth of crimes covered by the law is wide (including most violent felonies), only people with one conviction were allowed to apply.  About 5%-6% of eligible people applied for and received pardons within 5 years of eligibility (10 years after conviction) under this law. This is not dramatically different from Canadian experience where it is estimated that around 10% of those with criminal records have received pardons (at any point in their lives).  The reasons for the low uptake rate in Michigan appear to relate to six factors: lack of information about the possibility of getting one’s record ‘set aside’,  the enormous administrative hassle in gathering the relevant documentation for the application, the $50 fee (Canada’s fee is C$631),  distrust of the criminal justice system, lack of access to lawyers to answer questions, and low motivation to remove the criminal record.  Uptake of the set-aside provision was highest among women, people convicted when young, those with a non-violent felony, public order, or drug conviction, and those who had not been incarcerated., By linking criminal record data with employment data, the researchers were able to investigate the relationship between having one’s criminal record ‘set aside’ and the employment and income rates.  Those who were employed in the quarter immediately before the application were more likely to apply than those who were not employed.  But in addition, those who had suffered at least at 20% wage loss in the previous year were also more likely to apply., As is the case in Canada, very few people who had their records set aside were subsequently convicted of a new offence (4.2% overall, 1% for a felony) and almost nobody (0.6%) was subsequently convicted of a violent offence.  Immediately after having their criminal records set aside, people experienced a jump in employment rates and in wages.  It appears that the increase in wages is largely the result of previously minimally employed people working more or getting higher wages., Conclusion: The findings “strongly support the increased availability of expungement [of criminal records] and particularly efforts to make them automatic, or at least procedurally easy to obtain” (p. 53).  Expungement of records has no identified risks to public safety and clearly it has personal and societal benefits in terms of employment.  Said differently, removing, as much as possible, the stigma of having a criminal conviction appears to have value both for the person with a record of offending and society more generally., Reference: Prescott, J.J. and Sonja B.

"In some countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, immigrants hold more favourable views of the police than do native-born residents.  Canadian data demonstrate that this is largely due to the views held by recent immigrants from non-democratic countries.",", Immigrants to some western countries tend to hold more favourable views of the police than do people who were born in the country.  There is some evidence, however, that immigrants’ views are based, in part, on their experiences in their country of origin.  Such speculation is consistent with the finding that the difference between immigrants’ views and the views of native born is smaller for those who have lived in the host country for a long time., In 2016, about 22% of Canadian residents were born outside of Canada.  Immigrants, like members of Canada’s “visible minority” communities, do not constitute a homogeneous group.  They vary on many dimensions that may be relevant to understanding their views of the police. One important dimension may be their countries of origin.  It would be reasonable to expect that immigrants from fully democratic countries would have had very different experiences with the police in their countries of origin than immigrants from countries that do not have stable democratic traditions. Assuming that after arriving in Canada, they view Canadian police from the same perspective as they viewed police in their countries of origin, it can be hypothesized that country of origin should be related to their views of Canadian police., This paper looks at Canadians’ views of police as a function of their country of origin and the length of time that they had been in Canada.  The analysis focused on urban Canadians because almost 96% of immigrants in Canada live in urban areas. Data were obtained from Statistics Canada’s 2014 General Social Survey which contained 6 questions evaluating police performance and a seventh question on confidence the respondent had in the police.  The 7 questions, which were highly inter-correlated, were combined into a single scale of favourability toward the police.  Immigrants’ country of origin was used to divide them,  using the Economic Intelligence Unit’s Democracy Index,  into two groups: survey respondents from “full democracies” and respondents from flawed/authoritarian/mixed regimes.   In addition, respondents were divided into those who had been in Canada for at least 10 years and those who had immigrated more recently., The four immigrant groups (divided by type of country of origin – full democracies vs. others – and recent immigrants vs. long term residents of Canada) were compared to native born Canadians.  Recent immigrants from full democracies did not differ from native born Canadians in their views of police.  The group that was, by far, the most favourable toward the police and significantly different from all other groups was recent immigrants from countries that do not qualify as full democracies.   With additional time in Canada, however, immigrants from non-democratic countries became indistinguishable from those who had originally come from democratic countries.  The difference between recent immigrants from non-democratic countries and the other 3 groups held even after controlling for age, sex, marital status, education, visible minority status, perception of neighbourhood crime, contact with the police, and whether the person reported having experienced discrimination., Conclusion: Recent immigrants from non-democratic states may be evaluating the police largely in contrast to what they are used to in their countries of origins. Not surprisingly, then, they evaluate Canadian police more favourably than do recent immigrants from democratic countries.   Over time, the difference that country of origin makes diminishes and immigrants’ views begin to look much more like those of respondents who were born in Canada., Reference: Jung, Maria, Jane B.

Police actions can increase crime rates: Routine police stops of Black and Latino boys increase the likelihood that these boys will commit offences in the future. These stops also lead to boys reporting more psychological distress.,", There is growing evidence that there are negative effects of police stops on young people (e.g., Criminological Highlights 17(4)#6; Understanding the Impact of Police Stops – on the Criminological Highlights “collections” website).  This paper looks at the impact of police stops, questioning, and (sometimes) frisks of Black, Latino and other non-white boys – who are comparably more likely (Criminological Highlights, 16(3)#4) to be stopped by the police than are white boys., This study collected data from boys (23% Black, 58% Latino, 19% other non-white) in Grade 9.  They were then interviewed every 6 months for two years.  Multiple waves of data collection meant it was possible to examine changes in the behaviour of the boys after they had been stopped (or not) since the previous time period.   The boys were recruited from 6 high schools in a large southern US city.  They were asked whether, when out walking, they had been stopped by the police (and frisked or not).  Youths were also asked about delinquency in the previous 6 months using a 15-item set of questions about specific forms of delinquency.  Finally psychological distress was measured with questions about the frequency in the previous 6 months of experiencing negative emotions (e.g., “I feel downhearted and blue”; “I felt I was close to panic”)., There were no important (or consistent) differences in the findings across the three racial groups.  About 40% of the boys were stopped (and sometimes frisked) at least once during the 2 year period of the study.  Experiencing one or more stops by the police was associated with greater subsequent involvement in delinquent behavior for all three racial groups. The relationship between police stops and delinquent behaviour 6 months later was stronger for younger adolescents than it was for older adolescents.   Moreover, delinquency at one stage of the study did not predict subsequent police stops, again supporting the inference that the relationship between police stops and delinquent behaviour is not a result of delinquent youths being more likely to be stopped than non-delinquent youths.  Instead, the results support the conclusion that stops cause increased delinquency., In addition, “adolescents who had experienced more frequent police stops reported greater concurrent distress and greater concurrent delinquency” (p. 8265).  Equally important is the finding that “the more police stops a boy experienced, the more distress he reported six months later” (p.8265-6).  Once again, distress at one wave did not predict police stops 6 months later, supporting the inference that there is a causal link between police stops and psychological distress. Furthermore, distress – in part the result of police stops – did predict greater delinquency 6 months later., The conclusion that there is a causal link between police stops and subsequent delinquency is strengthened by the fact “at each wave of the survey, boys who reported little or no involvement in delinquency at the prior wave were just as likely to have been stopped by police 6 months later as boys who had reported higher levels of delinquent behaviour at the previous wave” (p. 8266)., Conclusion: In this study of Latino, Black, and other non-white boys, youths who were stopped by the police showed higher subsequent levels of delinquency than youths who had not been stopped.  In addition, prior law-abiding behaviour by a youth did not protect the youth from future police stops.  Hence there was apparently little a boy could do to avoid being in jeopardy of being stopped.  Stops appeared to cause both increases in psychological distress and increases in delinquency.  The “findings suggest that the single most common proactive policing strategy – directing officers to make contact with… boys… in ‘high-crime’ areas –  may impose a terrible cost” (p. 8367)., Reference:  Del Toro, Juan (and 9 others) (2019).  The Criminogenic and Psychological Effects of Police Stops on Adolescent Black and Latino Boys.  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 116(17), 8261-8268., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV18N1.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-18-no-1-%E2%80%93-july-2019,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 18, No. 1 – July 2019",Regular Issue,2019
Aggressive policing – saturating high-crime areas with police who are engaged in aggressive order-maintenance policing – interferes with the educational success of African-American boys.,", Research has shown that aggressive encounters between the police and Black city residents can have negative impacts on the mental health of Blacks who live nearby (Criminological Highlights 17(5)#2).  This paper looks at another important outcome: the school achievement of African-Americans and Hispanics who were exposed to high rates of aggressive policing in New York City., Between 2004 and 2012, the New York City police ordered, as part of its “Operation Impact,” about 1500 new police recruits to engage in aggressive order-maintenance policing, targeting disorderly behaviour in designated neighbourhoods.  The deployment pattern was such that every six months there could be a change in whether a given neighbourhood received this program. On average, high impact zones remained as such for 12.3 months (range 5.3 months to 7.5 years). Rookie officers working in these zones were encouraged to conduct high volumes of investigative stops and to arrest people for low-level offences (e.g., open containers of alcohol)., School records were examined during this period for all public schools in New York for students age 9 to 15.  These records contained not only measures of school performance, but also data on race, gender, age, eligibility for free lunch programs (a proxy for the economic status of the child) and whether the student was a new English speaker.  The police data used in the study involved records from the “Stop, Question and Frisk” program in the city., From the police data, it was possible to identify the ‘high impact’ zones.   From the education records, it was possible to determine if and when a student lived in one of those high impact zones and, therefore, whether the student had been exposed – directly or vicariously – to high impact aggressive policing.  The main dependent variables that were used were state-wide standardized tests of English and Math. These tests were taken in the spring of each year by all students in Grades 3 through 8.  The independent variable was the number of days in the previous year that the neighbourhood had been exposed to the high impact policing.  The analyses were restricted to African-American and Hispanic students because too few White and Asian students lived in high impact zones.  Though the pattern of results was similar for Math, the findings on the impact of policing on the standardized English Language Arts tests were stronger., For young (age 9) African-American boys, there was no apparent impact of the policing strategy on the English Language Arts scores. However, as this group grew older, high impact policing had the effect of lowering test scores such that by age 12, the effect was modest in size and statistically significant.  By age 15, the impact was substantial.  In fact, high impact policing lowered test scores of African-American boys by about the same amount as some of the most popular intervention programs would be expected to increase educational achievement. The program also reduced school attendance.  These results “suggest that policing programs such as Operation Impact can wipe out the potential benefits of other costly [educational] interventions” (p. 232).  From other analyses, it appears that the harmful effects of Operation Impact were evident during the time that it was in place but dissipated somewhat afterwards.  Nevertheless, after two years, the effect was still statistically significant. There was some evidence that the program may have reduced violent crime rates, though this impact disappeared as soon as the program ended.  There was no measurable impact on African-American girls or on Hispanic children., Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that aggressive policing strategies can negatively affect the educational prospects of those most exposed to them – in this case by lowering school performance of the group – African-American boys – who were most directly affected by the strategy. Hence “policing strategies and tactics may perpetuate racial inequalities in educational outcomes” (p. 239)., Reference: Legewie, Joscha and Jeffrey Fagan (2019).  Aggressive Policing and the Educational Performance of Minority Youth.  American Sociological Review, 84(2), 220-247., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV18N1.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-18-no-1-%E2%80%93-july-2019,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 18, No. 1 – July 2019",Regular Issue,2019
Homicide rates in the US increased in 2015 for the first time in many years. There is no reliable evidence that this increase was caused by the so-called “Ferguson effect” – a reduction in proactive police enforcement or a reduction in arrests after a number of highly publicized police killings of unarmed civilians in the US in 2014.,", Between 2014 and 2015, the US homicide rate increased by 11.4%, the largest one year increase since 1968.  The increase in large cities was even greater (17.2%).  The rates remained high through 2017.  In 2014 and 2015, there were a number of police killings of unarmed civilians, one of the most famous being the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Some commentators have suggested that changes in police tactics after these events led to an increase in homicides., In the absence of any evidence, the term “Ferguson effect” was coined, suggesting that the criticism of the police for killing unarmed civilians led police to disengage from proactive enforcement which, in turn, was seen as the cause of the homicide rate increase.  Other research (Criminological Highlights 17(3)#4) has suggested that the increases in homicides seen in some cities reflect the kind of variation that one could expect by chance.  This paper looks directly at the hypothesized cause of the increase in homicides — the rate of arrests by the police in 53 large US cities — and examines systematically whether changes in arrest rates might explain the increased number of homicides., Arrest rates, and changes in arrest rates over time, vary across cities.  If there really is a ‘Ferguson effect’ that accounts for the increase in homicides, one would expect, controlling for other possible causes of homicides, that decreases in arrest rates would be associated, within cities, with increases in homicides., This paper looks at the effect of arrest rates for five categories of offence for Blacks and for Whites between 2010 and 2015.  In addition, three control variables were incorporated into the model: the percent Black in the city, a measure of economic disadvantage and the rate of Hispanic immigration into the city.  The last measure was included because of “assertions of President Trump and others that Hispanic immigration increases the level of violent crime,” an assertion that, not surprisingly, is exactly the opposite of what has frequently been found (Criminological Highlights 17(4)#1, 17(1)#3, 16(1)#2, 14(1)#8, 13(6)#7, 11(1)#4, 10(6)#7, 5(4)#6).   Statistical methods were used that attempted to address the fact that it is difficult, in situations such as these, to determine whether something like changes in homicide rates are a cause or an effect of changes in arrest rates., The major problem with the “arrest rate decline” explanation of the increase in homicide rates is that “arrest rates [for Blacks and Whites] had been dropping for several years before the controversial police killings in Ferguson and elsewhere….  There is also no evidence of a sharper drop in arrest rates in 2015 than in earlier years as would be expected….” (p. 60).  Said differently, the drop in arrest rates predated the police killings of civilians in Ferguson.  In more sophisticated analyses, the total, Black, and White arrest rates did not have a consistent relationship with homicide rates.  In fact, in some instances higher arrest rates were associated with increases in homicide rates., Conclusion:  The investigation, then, looked at regression models of homicide rates, arrest rates and control variables in 53 large cities.  The models “allow for the… mutual influence of the arrest and homicide rates in each year after 2010” (p. 67) but provide little support for the notion that ‘de-policing’ was the cause of the increase in homicide rates., Reference: Rosenfeld, Richard and Joel Wallman (2019).  Did De-Policing Cause the Increase in Homicide Rates?  Criminology and Public Policy, 18, 51-75., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV18N1.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-18-no-1-%E2%80%93-july-2019,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 18, No. 1 – July 2019",Regular Issue,2019
"Canadian penitentiaries are able, if they wish, to identify, at admission, those who are highly likely to end up in administrative segregation. The goal of reducing the use of segregation could be accomplished, in part, by providing appropriate interventions or programming to those who, without intervention, have a very high likelihood of ending up in segregation.",", Close to a quarter of Canadian prisoners in federal penitentiaries spend at least six consecutive days in administrative segregation within two years of admission.  Though it is broadly agreed that the use of segregation (also referred to as solitary confinement) should be minimized, most of the focus of these efforts is on the decision-making process that leads to a person being put in segregation or being released back to the general population., This paper presents data related to an alternative approach to reducing the use of segregation: the development of a “Risk of Administrative Segregation Tool” designed to identify, easily and reliably, at the time that a prisoner is first admitted to penitentiary, whether that person, without intervention, is likely to end up for at least 6 days in administrative segregation. The research was first carried out on a sample of 11,110 prisoners and then validated on a different group of 5,591 prisoners. Over 400 potential predictor variables were examined., Although a large number of factors predict the use of segregation, a scale will be most useful if it can be constructed using variables that are readily available at or shortly after admission to penitentiary. Many of those who are placed in segregation (22%) have their first segregation placement within 60 days of admission (10% within one week)., Various scales, including standard ‘risk’ scales were examined.  The variable being predicted was whether the prisoner was placed in segregation (for at least six days) for “the inmate’s own safety” or for “jeopardizing security of the institution” (p. 5) within two years of admission.  Data suggest that about 90% of prisoners who are ever placed in segregation are placed there within two years of admission., In developing the scale to predict segregation, a number of guiding principles were used.  Simple options were preferred over complex measures if they didn’t result in meaningful loss of accuracy. Item weights were kept simple.  Information had to be readily and ordinarily available at admission.  The study explored whether it was preferable to develop four separate scales for Indigenous and Non-Indigenous men and women.  Initially both static variables and dynamic variables were examined, but in the end, a single scale composed of static elements was chosen because its accuracy was essentially as good – for all four groups – as that of the more complex scales., The final scale that was chosen had six items (age, number of prior convictions, previous admissions to administrative segregation, sentence length, number of different types of offences of convictions, and prior convictions for violence).  Points were assigned for each item. Overall scale scores ranged from 0 to 12.   The highest risk 22% of the prisoners on the scale had a 56% chance of being placed in segregation. If an intervention or treatment program could be developed that would be effective in eliminating the use of segregation for only half of this relatively small group, the use of administrative segregation would, overall, immediately be reduced by about 25%., Conclusion:  This study did not explore what interventions might be carried out early in a prison sentence to reduce the use of segregation of ‘high risk for segregation’ individuals identified at admission. Given that those most at risk of segregation placement can be reasonably accurately identified, it would appear that preventing the need for placement in segregation should be explored as a way of reducing the need for it.  At the same time, it is clear that “the scale should not be used to preemptively segregate” or to label prisoners.  Instead, this tool could be used to focus resources on reducing the use of segregation, thus freeing up other resources for more positive purposes., Reference: Helmus, L.

"The harmful effects of adolescent violent victimization on adult outcomes are more pronounced among youths whose backgrounds would suggest that they were the least likely to be victimized. For the most disadvantaged youths, the added negative impact of violent victimization did not add to their already relatively high likelihood of problematic life outcomes.",", It is well established that experiencing violent victimization as a youth is not evenly distributed across the population.  Hence it is not surprising that, in general, people who are likely to have experienced violent victimization as youths are more likely to experience negative life outcomes., Previous research has demonstrated that youths who have been victimized tend to complete fewer years in school, are at greater risk of depression and anxiety and tend to be more likely to experience violence as adults.  What is less clear, however, is whether experiencing violent victimization causes these negative adult outcomes, or if it is only associated., This study followed youths starting in Grades 7-12 for about 7 years until they were 18-26 years old. In the second year of the study, youths were asked if they had experienced a serious violent victimization in the previous year (i.e., had a knife pulled on them, had been stabbed, shot at, or jumped)., Using data on 50 different variables collected at the first wave of data collection, each youth’s likelihood of being violently victimized was estimated.  One year later, 15% of the youths had, in fact, been victimized.  Those who were victimized in this first year were matched with youths who had not been victimized but, in fact, had essentially the same likelihood of being victimized (based on the earlier data).  Hence, on relevant dimensions, the ‘victimized’ and ‘not victimized’ groups were equivalent.  Seven years later, when the participants were age 18-26, measures were obtained on their violent and property offending and violent victimization in the previous year, their hard drug use in the previous month, the experience of depression in the week immediately before being interviewed, and their educational attainment., The people who had experienced violent victimization as youths were, in comparison to their matched controls, more likely, as young adults, to report violent offending and victimization and lower educational attainment.  The sample was then divided into those who had, as youths, a low, medium, or high likelihood of being victims of violence (based on their circumstances when young).  The results were quite consistent: “The consequences of adolescent violent victimization on violent offending, [violent] victimization, depressive symptoms, and low educational attainment in early adulthood are strongest among those with the lowest risks of being violently victimized during adolescence” (p. 121-2)., Conclusion: The results show that the consequences of adolescent violent victimization on outcomes in early adulthood are concentrated most strongly among those with the lowest risk of being victimized. It is not, however, that the high-risk youth are more resilient. These youths “were already predisposed to experience these problematic life outcomes…. Low-risk youth, on the other hand, seem to have been diverted onto a negative life pathway that they were unlikely to have experienced prior to being violently victimized” (p. 125)., Reference: Turanovic, Jillian J.  (2019).  Heterogeneous effects of adolescent violent victimization on problematic outcomes in early adulthood.  Criminology, 57, 105-135., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV18N1.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-18-no-1-%E2%80%93-july-2019,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 18, No. 1 – July 2019",Regular Issue,2019
"Sex offence registries and public notification of the presence of sex offenders in a community are “based on myths, false and misguided assumptions” about those who have committed sex offences. The presence of these laws “breeds, facilitates, and justifies the emergence of additional misguided criminal justice policies which further expands the reach of the symbolic purpose of the initial misguided policies” (p. 150).",", Public beliefs about sex offenders only rarely have a basis in evidence (see Sex Offenders and Society’s Responses to Them under ‘special issues’ on the Criminological Highlights website). In many countries, including Canada, people convicted of certain sex offences must register their whereabouts with local police.  In some locations, the information in these registries is available to ordinary citizens., Existing data suggest that sex offenders, as a group, are quite heterogeneous.  Yet sex offence registration and notification (SORN) laws assume that sex offenders are almost invariably high risk to reoffend, have stable offending rates over time (‘once a sex offender, always a sex offender’) and are fundamentally different from those who commit other kinds of offences.  Each of these assumptions have been the focus of a substantial amount of research showing them to be untrue. For example, the data suggest that “if offending did persist among sex offenders, it was generally non-sexual in nature” (p. 136).  Similarly, the data do not support the notion that adolescent sex offenders are “on a path of life-course persistent sex offending” (p. 136)., SORN laws, then, do not emerge from a careful analysis of evidence.  Instead, they appear to emerge from public outcry in response to high-profile sex crimes (often involving the sexual assault and death of a child). The problem is that “There is no empirical evidence showing that registries facilitate police investigation and help solve sex crimes nor that they increase the probability of detention” (p. 138).  One obvious problem is that although the presence of these registries may be known, they are often not accessed by members of the public.  The evidence on the relationship of the existence of these registries to the rate of sex offending is, at best, mixed.  This is not terribly surprising because even if there were a deterrent impact of the presence of a registry, the studies of the quality of the data contained in them suggests that much of the data (e.g., residence locations), at any given time, is not accurate. But in addition, since a substantial number of those convicted of sex offenders are known to their victims (e.g., family members), one would not expect registries to be terribly effective., Moreover, there are potential harms of SORN laws on those subject to them, largely in terms of their ability to reintegrate peacefully into the community.  Restrictions on residence, for example, may interfere with stable reintegration.  And again, these restrictions appear to be based on the false assumption that offences take place near an offender’s residence., Conclusion: “Research showing that the assumptions that sex offence registration and notification laws make about sex offenders are false has not stopped these laws from spreading across all U.S states” (p. 150).  These laws have negative impacts on people who, though they may have once committed a relevant offence, are unlikely to reoffend in the future.  These negative impacts (e.g., harassment, victimization, eviction) may affect not only the offenders but their family members., Reference: Lussier, Patrick and Jeffrey Mathesius.

One way to reduce crime is to increase the number of local non-profit organizations that focus on improving life in urban communities.,"Communities often look to criminal justice organizations – most notably the police and courts – to reduce crime.  The effect that the justice system organizations have on crime is, however, quite limited.  This paper investigates the effects other organizations – local non-profits – have on crime., Beginning in the early 1990s, a rather dramatic decrease in crime occurred in the US.  Also during this time, there was growth in the number of community non-profit organizations in many US cities. One possibility is that non-profit organizations that “influence the level of social cohesion within a neighbourhood and the degree to which communities are able to solve problems” (p. 1215) may be responsible for at least some of the reduction in crime that occurred.  The challenge, then, is to see whether the growth in the number of these kinds of non-profit organizations contributed to the reduction in crime or whether the relationship between these two factors (growth in the number of non-profit organizations and reduction in crime) might be due to some other factor (e.g., broad economic prosperity)., Community oriented non-profit organizations often devote themselves to community issues broader than just crime reduction. Thus they might focus on general neighbourhood development, substance abuse, workforce development, or youth., The specific methodological challenge is that the growth of nonprofits in a community may well relate directly to crime problems: a city may invest in nonprofits because of a crime problem. Hence it is important to look at changes that occur within cities rather than across cities.   It turns out that the growth in community nonprofits is correlated with growth in nonprofits that are not community oriented (i.e., those focusing on the arts, medical, etc.).  However, growth in the density of these arts, etc., nonprofits is not related to crime reduction., This paper looks at the effects of changes in the density of community non-profit organizations in the 300 largest cities in the US on murder, violence and property crime rates, controlling for other factors (e.g., poverty, employment, race, etc.).  The findings suggest that the addition of community oriented nonprofits to a city resulted in reduction in all three measures of crime.  It would appear that nonprofits that focused largely on substance abuse programs and workforce development had the largest impact on crime. However, the other types of community focused nonprofits also appeared to have a crime reduction impact.  Given that there were more organizations aimed largely at neighbourhood development and youth, the impact of these other organizations was important.  Various other analyses were carried out in an attempt to strengthen the argument that the effects are causal, not just correlational., Conclusion: The findings supported the inference that investment in community oriented non-profits was effective.  This is not to say, of course, that any non-profit that purports to focus on communities is crime reducing.  Rather, it suggests that organizations whose primary goal is not necessarily crime reduction (e.g., those that focus on substance abuse and workforce development) can also have crime reducing impacts.  Obviously other factors contribute to the reduction of crime rates.  The findings here do not challenge these other successful approaches.  However, they do suggest that since many theories of crime relate to community factors, it is important, if one is interested in reducing crime, to consider investing in organizations whose purpose is to improve life in communities., Reference: Sharkey, Patrick, Gerard Torrats-Espinosa, and Delaram Takyar (2017).

A broad integrative work-release program for prisoners which combines work release and other integrative therapeutic programs can reduce reoffending.,", It is often assumed that ‘getting a job’ after prison will help prisoners stop offending.  But the relationship between work and reduced offending is complex (see Criminological Highlights 16(6)#3).  The employment programs related to prison that are effective in reducing reoffending appear to be those that involve more than just getting prisoners jobs (Criminological Highlights 15(3)#3)., This study examines work-release programs in Israeli prisons.   In addition to allowing certain low risk prisoners with 6-42 months left on their sentences to leave prison during the day to work at a paying job, the program is “integrated into a broader rehabilitative framework” such that it “serves as a bridge between life in prison and life in the community.” It does this by providing programs designed to help prisoners “develop personal and social skills that are believed… to enhance reintegration into the community following release” (p. 245).   Prisoners are housed in an ‘open door’ part of the prison and are allowed to travel unsupervised to and from work., The program, lasting 6-12 months, involves weekly group counselling sessions.  Prisoners also typically receive cognitive-behavioural group therapy.   In addition, they are allowed three days a month of unsupervised absence from the prison.   The jobs they work at are typically in production or manufacturing plants., About 30% of prisoners are dismissed from the program before completion.  However, since the study was designed to evaluate the program per se those prisoners who failed the program are considered to be part of the treatment group even though they did not complete the program., To create a comparison group, the study used “propensity score matching” – a technique designed to identify those who look just like those who received the treatment but did not receive it.  The matching procedure took into account various socio-demographic factors, the prisoners’ offences and incarceration histories, and various details of their experiences in prison., Re-arrest and re-incarceration rates for the treatment and control groups were examined during a 5-year follow-up period.   At all points during the follow-up period, those in the control (non-treated) group were more likely to be re-incarcerated.  After 5 years, 22.5% of the work-release participants were re-incarcerated compared to 33.1% of the untreated control group. Re-arrest rates showed a similar pattern:  32% of the work-release sample was rearrested compared to 46% of the control group., Conclusion:  Clearly the work-release program reduced the rate of re-offending leading to re-incarceration.   The size of the favourable effect of the program is unusually high which may reflect “the broad integrative approach of the work release program in Israel” (p. 256).    “Work release programs… must deal with the broader environment of prisoners, and the more general problems and difficulties that prisoners face with reintegrating into society” (p. 257)., Reference: Weisburd, David, Badi Hasini, Efrat Shoham, Gali Aviv, and Noam Haviv (2017).  Reinforcing the Impacts of Work Release on Prisoner Recidivism: The Importance of Integrative Interventions.  Journal of Experimental Criminology, 13, 241-264., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV17N1.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-17-no-1-%E2%80%93-january-2018,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 17, No. 1 – January 2018",Regular Issue,2018
"When the proportion of immigrants in neighbourhoods of two Australian cities increased between 2001 and 2011, violent crime in those neighbourhoods tended to decline.",", Recent research on the relationship between immigration and crime, carried out largely in the US (see Criminological Highlights 5(4)#6, 8(6)#3, 10(6)#7, 11(1)#4, 11(2)#1, 13(6)#7, 16(1)#2) suggests that increases in the concentrations of immigrants in cities does not  result in increases in crime.  Indeed, increases in the number of immigrants may be responsible for some of the ‘crime drop’ that has occurred in recent years., This paper looks, across time, at the impact of increases in concentrations of immigrants on violent crime in 882 neighbourhoods in two Australian cities (Brisbane and Sydney).  Sydney has served as a “gateway city” for immigrants for many decades.  Brisbane, on the other hand has, since 2001, seen substantial growth in its immigrant population – both in terms of numbers of immigrants and the diversity of country of origin.  Neighbourhoods in these two cities were the unit of analysis.  The study looks at changes within neighbourhoods in the concentration of immigrants and the relationship between these changes and violent crime rates.  The main independent variable of interest in the study is the percent of foreign born neighbourhood residents. Data for 2001, 2006, and 2011 were obtained for 580 Sydney and 302 Brisbane neighbourhoods., In both cities, looking at changes across time, neighbourhoods in which the number of immigrants grew tended to have decreases in violence.  However, these effects did not seem to be as large the effects of some of the relatively stable characteristics known to relate to crime rates in neighbourhoods (e.g., economic disadvantage)., White English-speaking immigrants (largely those born in the UK or New Zealand) comprise the largest group of foreign-born immigrants in Australia.  To determine if other immigrant groups who may face more economic and other challenges in Australia show different patterns, the effects of changes in the concentrations of the three other large groups of immigrants (Indian, Chinese, and Vietnamese) were examined.  The effects were a bit inconsistent across groups and cities. In a number of instances increases in the percent of one of these three groups was associated with significant decreases in violent crime (e.g., as the percent Chinese in Sydney neighbourhoods increased, violent crime went down).  However, in no case were increases in the concentrations of any of these three groups in either city associated with significant increases in violent crime., Reference: Increases in the concentration of immigrant groups in both Brisbane and Sydney were generally associated with decreases in violent crime.  There was no support for the hypothesis that increasing concentrations of immigrants increase crime.   Unfortunately, these findings, like much of the research literature on ‘immigration and crime’ do not “directly test the effect of immigrant concentration on the neighbourhood processes important for the regulation of crime” (p. 706). “While the general public may fear that increased immigration will increase crime rates…, this study suggests that such concerns are largely unjustified, at least in the Australian context” (p. 708).  These Australian findings are, however, quite consistent with US findings., Reference: Sydes, Michelle (2017).  Revitalized or Disorganized?  Unpacking the Immigration-Crime Link in a Multiethnic Setting.  Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency, 54(5), 680-714., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV17N1.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-17-no-1-%E2%80%93-january-2018,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 17, No. 1 – January 2018",Regular Issue,2018
"Victims of intimate partner violence are less likely to suffer from repeat victimization if the incident was reported to the police and the victim received help or advice from a victims’ services agency.  The arrest of the perpetrator, however, had no protective impact for the victim.",", Intimate partner violence (IPV) accounts for a substantial portion of violent victimizations of women and some, but a much smaller portion, of violent victimizations of men.  There is little agreement, however, about how society can best protect those who have experienced IPV from repeat victimization., The goal of this paper, using longitudinal survey data, was to examine the impact of three separate actions on repeat victimization: (1) reporting an IPV incident to the police; (2) the police decision to arrest the offender; and (3) victim contact with a social agency.  The study used the large US national victimization survey in which survey respondents were interviewed every 6 months for three years.  Of the 2,221 IPV victims, 83% of whom were women, about 20% experienced repeat victimization within the period of the follow-up.  The analyses that were carried out used ‘propensity score matching’ – a technique designed to equate groups that either received or did not receive each of the three ‘treatments’ (reporting to police, arrest of the offender by the police, and contact with a victims’ services organization). Separate matching was carried out to ensure that those being compared on the impact of each of these three ‘treatments’ were equivalent to those who did not receive the ‘treatment.’, In 26% of the cases of IPV, the police were contacted (by the victim or someone else).  In the matched sample (in which the two groups of victims – those in contact with the police and those not in contact – were matched), those whose crimes were reported to the police had a lower risk of victimization throughout the follow-up period (of up to 40 months).  For example, 6 months after the victimization, 16% of those whose victimization had been reported to the police reported a repeat victimization.  27% of those whose victimizations had not been reported to the police experienced a repeat victimization., However, the police decision – to arrest the accused person – was unrelated to repeat victimization., In addition, however, “the cumulative probability of repeat victimization was significantly lower for victims who received help from victim agencies than for those who did not” (p. 35).  Looking at equivalent groups of victims who did or did not access victim services, the study shows that the probability of repeat victimization within 6 months was 15% for those who accessed victims’ services and 21% for those who did not., Conclusion:  “Arrest does not produce the desired effect of keeping victims safe from abuse in this… diverse, nationally representative sample” (p. 358) of victims of intimate partner violence.  Additional analyses failed to discover any sub-sample of victims for whom arrest reduced re-victimization.  On the other hand, reporting the incident to the police and receiving victims’ services (perhaps at the suggestion of the police) did reduce re-victimization.  Unfortunately, it cannot be determined why reporting the incident to the police is effective, nor can it be determined what kinds of victims’ services are most effective., Reference: Xie, Min and James P.

Big data surveillance is changing the nature of big city policing.,", The use of ‘big data’ in many parts of modern society has changed the day to day operations of many professions.  This paper suggests that in some, but not all, ways, the use of big data has changed the nature of policing., Big data analytics has shifted policing practices to varying degrees: (1) Individual criminal risk assessment is quantified, (2) Data are being used for more predictive rather than reactive or explanatory purposes, (3) Dramatically more people are being made the target of surveillance, (4) People who have no direct contact with the police are now routinely included in the data used by police; (5) The police are using data collected for non-police purposes in order to try to identify possible offenders.  It is suggested that these changes “have implications for inequality, law, and organizational practice in a range of institutional domains” (p. 978).  In some cases big data analytics “is associated with mere amplifications in prior surveillance activities, but in others it is associated with fundamental transformations in surveillance activities and daily operations” (p. 985).   This study relies on interviews and observations of officers in the Los Angeles (California) Police Department as well as other related organizations., One of the most straightforward uses of ‘big data’ is the “quantification of civilians according to risk” (p. 936) on the basis of contact with the police, thus creating a list of people who are classified as ‘high risk’ on the basis of information that, at best, will be an imperfect predictor of what they might do in the future.  Lists of people calculated to be ‘high risk’ were given to Los Angeles police officers.  Clearly this is simply a more sophisticated version of the traditional focus of patrol officers on those they thought to be likely to offend.  A more important change that has occurred is the use of data to predict where offences might take place – a move from purely reactive policing to a predictive approach., One of the fundamental transformations of policing is the use of non-police data to identify links with other people, cars, phone numbers, and addresses.  In combination, for example, with automatic license plate readers, the police link offences, people, and locations.  However, the data used in these systems include such non-police indicators as foreclosures, collection agency data, and utility bills.  Moves are being made to include, in a single data base that would be available to the police, an individual’s interaction with law enforcement as well as with agencies involved in social, health, mental health, and child and family services., Although it could be argued that the use of big data might “replace unparticularized suspicion of racial minorities”,  these approaches obviously “may be implicated in the reproduction of inequality… by deepening the surveillance of [certain] individuals…, widening the criminal justice dragnet unequally, and leading people to avoid surveilling institutions that are fundamental to social interaction” (p. 997)., Conclusions: Predictions and data analytics might appear at first blush to be impartial.  But the data that are used determine, to some extent, the outcome.  Once a person is ‘in’ the system and has ordinary links to those whom the police see as suspicious, that person is more likely – correctly or not – to be seen as suspicious.  Unequal rates of database inclusion that will necessarily occur with the inclusion of external non-police (e.g., welfare) data, can have unanticipated negative impacts on those who are then subject to increased surveillance.  “The burden of new surveillance practices is not borne equally, nor is the error they produce” (p. 999).  Clearly, legal frameworks need to be developed to take account of the changes that are occurring., Reference:  Brayne, Sarah (2017).

Offenders under age 25 sentenced to prison have a lower likelihood of completing secondary school than those sentenced to house arrest enforced with electronic monitoring.,", There is a substantial amount of information suggesting not only that imprisonment does not reduce subsequent offending but that it also can have harmful effects in other domains of life (e.g., Criminological Highlights 16(4)#5, 14(6)#1, 11(4)#3).  This paper examines the impact of imprisonment in comparison with electronically monitored house arrest on the completion rate of secondary school by young men in Denmark., In 2006, Denmark amended its legislation to allow prison authorities to substitute periods of electronically monitored house arrest for short periods of imprisonment.  The goals were simple: to maintain labour market participation and educational enrollment.  From 2006 onwards, those sentenced to prison for up to 3 months are allowed to apply to serve their sentences at home, enforced with electronic monitoring.  Assuming certain conditions (e.g., having a permanent address and consent from others living there), they are allowed to serve their sentences in the community. However, they must also attend a crime prevention program, allow unannounced visits from correctional workers, and agree to drug and alcohol testing. Denmark, like Canada, makes frequent use of relatively short sentences (In Denmark 61% of prison sentences were under 4 months; in Canada 77% of prison sentences were 3 months or less)., This study looked only at those offenders who were enrolled in an education program at the time of conviction and were sentenced to prison for 3 months or less between 2006 and 2009.  The house arrest sample consisted of 443 offenders who met the criteria for release (even though only 63% actually received this treatment).  The data were analyzed conservatively: the house arrest-electronic monitor group consisted of all those eligible for this program whether or not they applied for it.  The ‘prison only’ group consisted of those convicted prior to the implementation of the reform who, therefore, served their sentences in prison.  The two groups were matched on over 20 variables (e.g., criminal history, offence type, educational attainment, etc.). All offenders were followed for 3 years after their release from prison or the electronic monitoring program., There were no short term (3 months to 1 year) differences between the two groups.  However, two years after the end of their sentences (prison or electronically monitored house arrest), those given the opportunity to serve their sentences in the community were less likely to have dropped out of school and more likely to have completed their post-secondary education., Conclusion: Participation in an electronically monitored house arrest program, as compared to normal imprisonment, has long term beneficial effects on secondary school completion rates.  The fact that these effects showed up in the long term (2 to 3 years after the completion of the sentence) suggests that the overall program, part of which required attending school, was more effective than standard imprisonment even though the duration of the formal program was, at most, 3 months. It may have been effective, in large part, because those who participated in the electronically monitored house arrest program did not have their lives (and education) disrupted by imprisonment., Reference: Larsen, Britt Østergaard (2017).  Educational Outcomes After Serving with Electronic Monitoring: Results from a Natural Experiment. Journal of Quantitative Criminology, 33, 157-178., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV17N1.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-17-no-1-%E2%80%93-january-2018,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 17, No. 1 – January 2018",Regular Issue,2018
Are those who don’t find prison to be very aversive less likely to be deterred by a prison sentence?  Not if one controls for their offence and criminal record.,", It is sometimes suggested that if prison life were made more unpleasant, those subjected to it would be less likely to commit offences that would put them in jeopardy of returning to prison.  This paper investigates the relationship between subjectively experienced severity of imprisonment and recidivism., There is evidence that compared to those given non-custodial sentences, those sentenced to prison are not less likely to reoffend (see Criminological Highlights “The Effects of Imprisonment”).   In addition, those receiving longer sentences do not appear to be more likely to be deterred than those receiving short sentences. What has not been investigated is whether those who experience imprisonment as particularly harsh are more likely to be deterred than those who find imprisonment to be not so aversive., This study examines the initial experiences of male prisoners in a pretrial facility in the Netherlands who subsequently were sentenced to prison.  Data were collected three weeks after the prisoners entered the facility. They were asked to rate the severity of their experience, how much it felt like a punishment, and the degree to which they saw detention as harder than they had thought it would be.   Because prisoners varied considerably in their backgrounds, a number of control variables were included.  These included the sentence they received, the offence type, criminal history including whether they had previously been imprisoned, as well as a number of personal characteristics (e.g., age, ethnicity, education, employment, family situation)., Without taking into account the control variables, the analysis supported the hypothesis that subjectively experienced severity acted as a deterrent: those who indicated that they found imprisonment to be more harsh were less likely to reoffend within 6 months.  The actual length of imprisonment also had an independent impact on recidivism.  However, when offence type as well as other characteristics of the offender (previous convictions, etc .) were controlled for, the effect of the subjectively experienced severity of imprisonment disappeared., It turns out that those who report that imprisonment is particularly difficult tend to be those with no convictions in the past 5 years, and those who, prior to being incarcerated, were employed and who had partners.  In addition, those who were convicted of sex, weapons, or public order offences were particularly likely to see imprisonment as harsh., Conclusion:  The study demonstrates how easy it would be to find support for the view that “harsh prison conditions deter.” If standard predictors of reoffending (e.g., criminal record) are not taken into account, one could easily – but erroneously – conclude that subjectively experienced harsh prison regimes keep people from reoffending immediately after they are released. But when standard predictors of reoffending are taken into account, the subject experience of imprisonment is not related to reoffending rates., Reference: Raaijmakers, Ellen A. C., Thomas A.

Americans who believe that offenders should be given harsh sentences are also likely to resent special favourable treatment of Black Americans and government attempts to help the poor.,", Previous research has suggested that punitive criminal justice views relate to at least three separate concerns: that social solutions to crime do not work, the sense that society is experiencing a moral decline and those who engage in crime threaten the moral order, and that Blacks, who are perceived to be disproportionately responsible for crime, are inappropriately getting special favourable treatment in other areas of life., This paper examines these explanations as well as one additional explanation: “that American punitiveness is rooted in the neoliberal ‘war against the poor’” (p. 937).  The paper uses data from the U.S. General Social Surveys in 2000 and 2014 and focuses on two measures of punitiveness: support for the death penalty and whether respondents think that the courts are too lenient in the sentences they hand down., The study measured “concern about crime” by asking people whether sufficient resources were being allocated to law enforcement and the problems of crime.  “Social anxiety” was assessed with three questions related to whether people, in general, can be trusted,  whether people generally try to be helpful, and whether people try to be fair.  “Anti-Black racial attitudes” were assessed with questions on matters such as whether Blacks should be expected to succeed in society without special programs.  “Animus toward the poor” was assessed with questions related to income disparity and whether the government has a responsibility to help improve the standard of living of the poor.  Various other factors (e.g., age, race, political orientation, religiosity) were controlled for., In both 2000 and 2014, support for the death penalty was related to social anxiety (the view that most people cannot be trusted), racial resentment (that Black Americans are inappropriately receiving special treatment) and negative views of the poor (that the poor are responsible for their own position in life)., When looking at support for punitive sentencing, both racial resentment and negative views of the poor predicted support for harsher sentences in 2000 and in 2014.  The other predictors were not consistent over time., Conclusion: “Both racial resentment and animus toward the poor are powerful predictors of punitive views, despite recent decreases in racial intolerance and the overall prevalence of punitive views. These results… point to the continued salience of race and poverty in conceptions of the threatening ‘other’.” (p. 956-7).   These results are also consistent with other research “suggesting that anti-Latino sentiment [in the US] is linked with support for aggressive policing” (p. 957).  More generally, the results suggest that “the social sources of punitive views have not shifted fundamentally” (p. 957) in the US between 2000 and 2014., Reference: Brown, Elizabeth K., and Kelly M.

"A sophisticated looking, commercially marketed risk prediction instrument is no more accurate in predicting criminal reoffending than ordinary people’s risk predictions using age, sex, and readily available indicators of a person’s criminal history.","Complex algorithms, using many data points, to predict recidivism (or offending while on pretrial release) are attractive to criminal justice professionals because they give an apparently objective answer to the question, “Is it safe to release this person into the community?”, This study provides a detailed analysis of one such prediction system, COMPAS, which was developed by Equivant (previously Northpointe).   The details of the algorithm used by COMPAS are not public., There is little question that such systems are “valid,” in that they predict better than chance.  The more important questions are what kinds of errors they make and whether they are more accurate than less sophisticated systems., This paper uses data from 7214 defendants in one county in Florida and compares the accuracy of the predictions made by COMPAS, using an undisclosed number of features, to two other kinds of predictions: (a) Ordinary statistical predictive models using a small number of characteristics of the person, and (b) Intuitive predictions made by ordinary people who have no particular expertise in predicting recidivism.   There are disputes in the research literature concerning the best measures to use to describe the accuracy of a predictive scale.  This paper presents a number of them that, fortunately, are readily interpretable., The results are remarkably consistent.  Overall accuracy for COMPAS predictions of recidivism (arrest within two years) was indeed better than chance.  But its accuracy was no different from simple logistic regression models using age, sex, charge, and some features of the criminal record. Perhaps most interesting is that ordinary people who volunteered to do a web-based survey and were presented with summaries of information about these Florida defendants that included only sex, age, offence, and 3 features of their criminal record, performed just as well as COMPAS., Though COMPAS was more accurate than chance (65.2% accuracy overall), and was equally accurate for black and white defendants, the types of errors made by the software were different for the two racial groups.  False positives (predicting recidivism when it didn’t occur) were much more common for black defendants than for white defendants.  On the other hand, false negatives (predicting recidivism would not occur when it did) were more common for white defendants.   These same differences were found for untrained people in the web-based survey and for an additional sample of ordinary people who were given the defendant’s race when making their predictions.  In other words, the commercial software disadvantaged black defendants – and gave advantages to white defendants – in a manner that was very similar to the manner in which ordinary people’s risk assessments disadvantaged black defendants., Conclusion:  “When considering using software such as COMPAS in making decisions that will significantly affect the lives and well-being of criminal defendants, it is valuable to ask whether we would put these decisions in the hands of random people who respond to an online survey because, in the end, the results from these two approaches appear to be indistinguishable” (page 3)., Reference: Dressel, Julia and Hany Farid  (2018) The Accuracy, Fairness, and Limits of Predicting Recidivism.  Science Advances (American Association for the Advancement of Science), 4., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV17N2.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-17-no-2-%E2%80%93-march-2018,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 17, No. 2 – March 2018",Regular Issue,2018
The presence of substance abuse treatment facilities in a community reduces crime in that community.,", The purpose of providing treatment for those addicted to various substances is not primarily to reduce crime.  However, community programs that address social and personal problems for those with substance abuse problems might well be expected to reduce crime simply because they improve the well-being of those in the community (Criminological Highlights 17(1)#1)., Drug addiction problems do not happen in isolation.  One of the possible benefits of having substance abuse treatment (SAT) facilities readily available in a community is that these organizations can refer their clients to other programs (e.g., for mental health treatment) that clients might not otherwise connect with.  This paper examines the influence of SAT facilities at the (US) county level, not on individuals, but instead on a set of indicators of the well-being of the community: crime rates.  Hence the study “cannot separate the effects of SAT facilities on those who receive treatment from the effects of SAT facilities on the broader community” (p. 4)., From a national data set in the US, it was possible to estimate the number of SAT clinics in a given county.  The study examined counties in which there was at least one SAT in the period 1999-2010 and looked at the relationship of changes in the concentration of SATs to changes in homicides, violent crimes, and financially-motivated crimes.   Various controls (e.g., unemployment rate, police officers per capita, age and racial makeup of the county) were included in the analyses.   The primary analyses examined the effects of the number of SATs in the community in one year on crime in the next year., Not surprisingly, an increase in the concentration of SATs was associated with a net reduction in drug-induced mortality rates. As the concentration of SATs increased, there tended to be a reduction in homicides, though there was no apparent effect of SATs on intra-familial homicides.  More generally, there was a reduction in various forms of violent crime associated with an increase in the concentration of SATs.  The exception to this was simple/common assaults (which constituted about 77% of all violent crime): There was no association between an increased presence of SATs and simple/common assaults.  However, an increased concentration of SATs was associated with a small reduction in financially-motivated crimes (when excluding the most minor forms)., Given the design of the study, there is always the possibility that the causal relationship is in the opposite direction:  Facilities may move into locations where crime is coming under control.  To test for this, an analysis was carried out in which crime rates were used to predict the number of SAT facilities in a future year.  These effects were never significant, suggesting that it is the increased presence of SATs that may be responsible for a lower crime rate., Conclusion:  The effects of placing additional substance abuse treatment facilities in a county were consistent.  With the exception of minor crimes (minor assaults or simple thefts), additional treatment facilities in the community in a given year tended to reduce more serious crime in the following years.  However, though the effects were statistically significant, they were not large in size.  Hence it is unlikely that the crime reduction impact of these substance abuse facilities would be noticed in a community.   Nevertheless,  given that the purpose of these facilities is to address addiction issues (and deal with associated problems), the crime reducing effect is a favourable unforeseen outcome of providing a much needed service to people in need., Reference: Bondurant, Samuel R., Jason M.

Being arrested and being incarcerated each have negative impacts on the mental health of young adults.,", Arrest and incarceration repeatedly have been shown to have negative impacts on a person caught up in the criminal justice system and on others related to that person (e.g.,  Criminological Highlights 17(1)#6),16(3)#2, 16(2)#1, 16(4)#5,#7,  16(6)#8) 14(2)#1).  This paper examines the impact of criminal justice contact on the self-rated mental health over a ten year period of a sample of people age 18-20 at the start of the study., Arrest could have a negative impact on people’s mental health in a number of ways.  In addition to stigmatizing effects, arrest may lead to feelings of powerlessness and alienation.  Arrest also may disrupt normal obligations (e.g., work or child care) and lead to uncertainty about the future.  Conviction and incarceration can have effects above and beyond the effects of arrest., Obviously, those arrested (and perhaps subsequently incarcerated) are different from those who are not.  This paper addresses this problem by looking at changes over time in self-reported mental health in a sample of about 7500 people who were interviewed every second year.  In that way, it was possible to see if there were negative impacts on the mental health of a young person after the experience of arrest (and incarceration, if that occurred)., Mental health was measured with 5 questions about how often, in the previous month, respondents felt nervous, calm and peaceful (reverse coded), downhearted and blue, happy (reverse coded) and ‘so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer them up’ (p. 725)., Arrest was associated with a substantial subsequent decrease in self-rated mental health, even when controlling for 13 factors that change over time (e.g., age, marital and family status, employment, economic situation, drug or alcohol abuse and delinquent behaviour).  Incarceration also was related to a decrease in self-rated mental health, above and beyond the impact of arrest (including these same control variables).  The simple effect of incarceration (above and beyond the effect of arrest) was, however, smaller than the effect of arrest., Keeping in mind that this sample was relatively young and followed for about 10 years, it was possible to examine the impact of the first incarceration.  When one looks at the impact of the first arrest and first incarceration, the negative impacts of these two criminal justice interventions were comparable in size.  A more detailed analysis, however, suggested that it was pretrial detention (incarceration) rather than sentenced incarceration that contributed to the decline in self-rated mental health., To strengthen the conclusion that the effects were due to criminal justice intervention causing a decline in mental health (rather than mental health problems leading to arrest and incarceration), a separate analysis determined that there was no significant impact of changes in mental health status on subsequent arrest and incarceration., Conclusion: These data suggest that arrest and pre-trial detention – but not conviction – have independent negative impacts on the self-rated mental health status of young adults.  Arrest, however, accounts for over half of the negative association between incarceration and mental health.  These negative effects are fairly similar across racial/ethnic minority groups., Reference: Sugie, Naomi F. and Kristin Turney (2017).  Beyond Incarceration: Criminal Justice Contact and Mental Health.  American Sociological Review, 82(4), 719-743., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV17N2.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-17-no-2-%E2%80%93-march-2018,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 17, No. 2 – March 2018",Regular Issue,2018
An Australian study demonstrates that the police can affect the likelihood that Australian Muslims will report potential extremist activities to the police by treating them in a manner that engenders trust in the police.,", For many years, and most clearly since 2001, western countries have had concerns about whether members of certain groups – most notably Muslims – are willing to cooperate with police in criminal investigations.  If the police are going to be effective in preventing possible terrorist acts (or other crimes), they need to know what is happening in the communities they police and they need to be able to rely on people’s willingness to report potential terrorist activities to police.   This study examines “how willing [Australian] Muslims are to work collaboratively with police in the fight against terrorism” (p. 1145)., This study builds on previous work (e.g., Criminological Highlights 11(4)#1) in examining the role of procedurally just policing on Muslims’ willingness to report potential extremist activities to the police.  It extends that work by examining possible intervening mechanisms:  the perception of the legitimacy of the local police and the extent to which respondents identify themselves as members of their national community., A complex identification and screening process was used to locate 800 Australian Muslims in three cities.  They were interviewed in person in 2014 and were asked 10 questions related to procedural justice in dealing with issues surrounding terrorism (e.g., “When dealing with people in your community concerning issues of terrorism, the police…give people a chance to express their views before making decisions”, “…treat people with dignity and respect”, etc.). To assess the perceived legitimacy of the police they were asked 8 questions (e.g., agreement with “The way the police act in my community is usually consistent with the values of people in my community about what is right and wrong”). To identify how much they identified as Australians, they were asked 4 questions (e.g., “I see myself as Australian first and Muslim second”).  Finally people were asked how likely they were to report to the police 6 different activities (e.g., “A person talking about travelling overseas to fight with Muslims”; “A person reading religious literature you believe to be extremist”). Control variables included age, gender, education, income and the frequency of contact with the police in the previous 12 months., In a regression model, the strongest single predictor of self-reported cooperation with the police was the respondent’s view of how procedurally just the police were.   Above and beyond this, perceptions of police legitimacy and identification as an Australian also contributed to an understanding of who would report suspicious activities to the police, though each of these effects is weaker than procedural justice.   Those who had contact with the police in the previous 12 months were less likely to cooperate with them., But in addition, “[i]f police are seen to be using procedural justice when engaging Muslims, they are viewed as more legitimate and [the respondent’s] social identification with Australia is bolstered” (p. 1156).  However, a somewhat different analysis suggested that perceived procedural justice had its effect on cooperation with the police because it increased the perceived legitimacy of the police, rather than by increasing a respondent’s identification as an Australian., Conclusion:  The police often rely on members of the public for key pieces of information about suspicious activities in their community.   Potential terrorism activities are one such example, but not the only one.  This study adds to a growing list of research (e.g., Criminological Highlights 4(4)#1, 7(1)#4, 11(4)1, 12(5)#2, 15(1)#3, 15(3)#2, 15(4)#3) suggesting that procedurally just behaviour on the part of police can be important in ensuring cooperation and compliance with the police.  This study demonstrates that the police can increase their legitimacy and their effectiveness in combatting terrorism simply by acting in a fair and just manner with those in the community who might have very useful information., Reference: Madon, Natasha S., Kristina Murphy and Adrian Cherney (2017).  Promoting Community Collaboration in Counterterrorism: Do Social identities and Perceptions of Legitimacy Mediate Reactions to Procedural Justice Policing?  British Journal of Criminology, 57, 1144-1164., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV17N2.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-17-no-2-%E2%80%93-march-2018,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 17, No. 2 – March 2018",Regular Issue,2018
An attempt at replicating a procedural justice experiment with Scottish police engaged in a road safety campaign did not lead to the expected results.  An investigation of the program’s failure suggests that insufficient attention was paid to implementing it properly.,", It is not unusual that something that appears to ‘work’ in one setting does not work in another.  There are several possible explanations for these “failures to replicate.”  This study investigates an attempt, in Scotland, to replicate an Australian study in which police tested the impact of a set of “procedural justice” approaches in their interactions with citizens during ordinary police-initiated encounters., The original Australian study found that members of the public who interacted with police officers during an ordinary police-initiated encounter were more favourable to the police when the police spoke to the citizen in a manner that “signaled dignity and respect, invited citizen participation, and provided clear explanations during encounters [with the police]” (p. 323)., In the Scottish replication, half of the Scottish road police units were randomly assigned to implement this new model of interaction (the ‘experimental group’). This interaction was supposed to include “all of the key elements of the procedural justice model” (p. 323).  The other half of police units (the ‘control group’) were to conduct business-as-usual.  Drivers were, at the end of their interaction with the police (in both the experimental and control group), given a questionnaire to fill out giving their assessment of the interaction.  When completed, the questionnaire was to be returned by mail., Implementation was not smooth. Though the original intent was to involve all officers in the experimental group in a briefing section, this turned out to be impossible.  Instead, all officers in the experimental group were given written instructions on the key messages they were to communicate to the citizen during the interaction.  These instructions included an actual example, but “the intention was not that the officers would follow a given script verbatim” (p. 324).   The results were exactly the opposite from what was expected: in the ‘control’ areas, judgements of the fairness of the police and satisfaction with them improved in comparison to pre-intervention data; in the experimental areas, ratings of the police did not improve., There are a number of plausible reasons for the failure.  Interviews with 55 officers in the experimental group revealed a number of implementation problems. It appeared that there was “a reliance on top-down command to motivate and regulate officer involvement” (p. 326).  Some officers felt they had to follow the instructions verbatim rather than incorporate aspects of procedural justice into their interaction with the public.  Other officers had no idea they were supposed to do anything special.  Still others were aware of the directive, but felt they were already doing what the directive told them to do; hence they could ignore the directive. More generally, the officers didn’t seem to believe in the purpose of the experimental change. All of this “led to a very negative set of reactions across the experimental units and the different ranks of officers within the units” (p. 334). This is not surprising since “Many officers felt that the experimental requirements, as they had understood them, would have a damaging effect on how they were perceived by the drivers [they were interacting with]” (p. 335).  Others saw it as part of “long term erosions to officers’ discretion” (p. 336)., Conclusion: This experimental program on procedural justice was implemented without adequate external monitoring and without officer buy-in of the essential ideas.  Hence its implementation may have “triggered a negative response among the officers” (p. 326).  Clearly normal “internal structures and processes cannot be relied on to disseminate and communicate details [of programs like this]” (p. 341) especially when their purpose is to get police to behave differently form the way they normally do.  In addition, implementation needs to take into account the particular culture and practices of the organization (the police in this case) that may be suspicious of ideas that originate from outside of the organization (researchers in this case).  Third, it would be helpful if there was strong support for the assumptions behind the program.    Clearly new ideas in policing need to be tested.  But the details of how to carry out such tests need to be thought out as thoroughly as the ideas themselves., Reference: MacQueen, Sarah and Ben Bradford (2017).  Where Did It All Go Wrong?

"The effect of a conviction for marijuana possession on obtaining rental housing depends on how old the conviction is, whether the government says it should be ignored in employment situations, and whether the conviction was for a felony or a misdemeanor.",", Having a criminal record has been shown to decrease the likelihood that a person will find employment (Criminological Highlights 6(3)#2, 15(1)#7).  But having a record almost certainly interferes with ordinary life in other ways.  This paper looks at the manner in which different kinds of criminal records – apparently received for similar offences – affect an important aspect of integrating into society: obtaining rental housing., Some earlier research has demonstrated that having a criminal record reduces the likelihood that a landlord will consider renting to prospective tenants.  This paper compares the effects of different kinds of records. The experiment described in this paper was carried out by making telephone calls under the name “Matthew O’Brien” to rental property managers who had advertised housing for US$1200/month or less (modal rent: $700) in 20 neighbourhoods in Columbus, Ohio. Previous studies have shown that almost everyone without a criminal record is considered for tenancy,  Therefore, because this study was interested in the effects of different types of records, the ‘applicant’ always identified himself as having a criminal record., The ‘baseline’ criminal record was described by the ‘applicant’ as follows:  “I have a felony drug conviction for marijuana possession that is one year old… I don’t have any other convictions or anything else pending.”  64% of the property managers turned the applicant down on the basis of that information.    Each of the other descriptions of criminal record led to increased success in being accepted as a possible tenant.   If the criminal record was described as a misdemeanor, only 16% turned the applicant down.   If the record was a ‘ten year old felony’ 44% turned the applicant down.  As time since the conviction increased, the impact of the record on obtaining housing declined somewhat.  But it is interesting to note that a ten year old felony conviction (with no subsequent convictions) is, from the perspective of getting housing, more of an impediment than a 1-year old misdemeanor conviction for the same basic offence., Perhaps the most interesting finding is that if the applicant with a one year old felony conviction reported that he had a “Certificate of Qualification for Employment” (CQE) from the state government, only 32% turned him down (compared to 64% without a CQE). A CQE “was designed to demonstrate rehabilitation to employers, remove automatic licensing bars, and protect employers from negligent hiring claims” (p. 528).  The findings in this study show that being certified by the state to be employable made those with convictions more eligible for housing.  However, the applicant with a 1-year old felony and the CQE was still more likely to be turned down than the applicant with a 1-year old misdemeanor., Conclusion: Having a recent conviction and a felony (rather than a misdemeanor) criminal record makes it more difficult to obtain one of the fundamental requirements for successful reintegration into society – housing.  However, even though criminal records may be public in some jurisdictions and even though it may not be possible to ban landlords and property managers from asking potential tenants about criminal records, it seems that formal state processes that deem the person to be no longer deserving of special (negative) treatment because of their past behaviour can have a significant effect on lessening the effect of this stigma., Reference: Leasure, Peter and Tara Martin (2017).  Criminal Records and Housing: An Experimental Study.  Journal of Experimental Criminology, 13, 527-535., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV17N2.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-17-no-2-%E2%80%93-march-2018,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 17, No. 2 – March 2018",Regular Issue,2018
Pretrial detention of ordinary offenders appears to have some long-term negative impacts on those detained while not providing any long term public safety.,", Many countries, including the US and Canada, have large numbers of people who are detained prior to trial.  In the US, it is estimated that about 23% of those imprisoned on an average night are awaiting trial. In Canada, the figure is 37%.  This paper examines what the impact of detention is on those being detained., It is safe to assume that those held in pretrial detention are different from those who are released.  Similarly, it is safe to assume that the charges that detainees face, and the evidence against them, also differ from those who are released.  The challenge, then, is to find comparable groups of people who are either released or held prior to trial.  This paper exploits a well-established criminal justice fact: judicial officers vary in the leniency of their decisions.  Furthermore, in the two counties in which this study was carried out, cases were effectively randomly assigned to judges.  Judges at the bail stage in these jurisdictions have limited information on which to decide on release or detention.  For cases in the middle of a ‘seriousness’ dimension – where it is plausible for the accused either to be detained or release – the essentially random assignment of cases to judges means, effectively, that accused people are randomly assigned to have either a high probability of release or a high probability of being held. There were substantial differences in the tendency to release accused people across judges in each jurisdiction. This study focuses on those cases in the middle where judges disagree on whether an accused should be released or detained.  The judges doing bail were different from those making other decisions about the accused., Those who were lucky enough to get a lenient bail judge (i.e., they were released pre-trial) were less likely to be found guilty (and less likely to plead guilty).   Not surprisingly, in comparison to those not released (or released after being held for more than 3 days) those released within three days were more likely to fail to appear in court before trial.   More importantly, however, there was no overall impact of being detained or not on the likelihood of committing an offence within 2 years of the bail hearing. This pattern reflects two separate findings. First, those released prior to trial were, not surprisingly, more likely than those detained to commit a new crime prior to disposition.  Second, however, those released were less likely to commit a new crime after the original case was disposed compared to those who were detained.  Overall, then, the community receives short term benefits of pre-trial detention. But the short-term benefit is wiped out by the fact that those detained are more likely to offend within 2 years of the bail hearing., The researchers were able to link these defendants to federal tax returns. The tax data showed that defendants who were initially released at their bail hearings had higher formal employment and earnings 3-4 years after the bail hearing than those who were detained.   This effect probably comes about in part because those not subjected to pretrial detention are less likely to be found guilty and, as a result, are able to obtain employment. This may also subsequently reduce the likelihood of offending., Reference:  The results of this study – in which criminal defendants on the basis of a near-random decision were detained or released at their bail hearing – suggest that “the adverse labour market outcomes and criminogenic effects [of being processed in the criminal justice system] begin at the pretrial stage prior to any finding of guilt, highlighting the long-term costs of weakening a defendant’s negotiating position before trial and the importance of bail in the criminal justice process” (p. 236)., Reference: Dobbie, Will, Jacob Goldin, and Crystal S.

"If we were truly interested in reducing the number of fatal police shootings of civilians, we might shift our attention from deterrence models that search for blame to prevention models that search for rare combinations of risk factors and errors that produce fatal shootings.",", When police killings of citizens take place and the police officer who fired the gun is not charged with or not found guilty of a crime, the incident is often characterized as “a tragic failure to hold an individual police officer accountable” rather than even considering the possibility that, in addition, the death was “a failure to hold organizational systems accountable” (p. 422).  Said differently, it is important that police be held accountable for their actions, but if we wish to reduce police killings, we should broaden our approach to understanding and intervening to reduce the size of the problem., There are reasons to believe that the number of people killed as a result of officer-involved shootings (currently about 1000 per year in the US) will not be reduced solely by punishing police. These reasons include the fact that convictions are hard to obtain, the high esteem in which police are held by the public, and the fact that many killings do not involve criminal intent or the breaking of police rules.  Police shootings in the US occur primarily in smaller cities: 69% of police shootings in the US took place in cities of 250,000 or less. About half occurred  in cities with 50,000 or less., The number of police shootings has been reduced before. Between 1970 and 1985, the number of civilians killed by police was cut in half, in large part because of bans on shooting nonviolent fleeing suspects.  Restrictions on when police could shoot were shown (in the early 1980s) to have “no adverse effects on police officer safety and crime, but… large reductions in police shootings did follow [the implementation of these restrictions]” (p. 426).   These restrictions, to be effective, had to be supported internally, implemented appropriately, and enforced., After 1985, the number of police killings rose in part, perhaps, because police were increasingly armed with semiautomatic firearms with large ammunition clips.  More recently, attempts to reduce police shootings of civilians (e.g., through mandatory training in de-escalation tactics) have never been evaluated properly.  But a fair amount is known about police shootings (see Zimring’s 2017 book When Police Kill).  What is needed to fully to use this information effectively is what has been called “preventive imagination” (p. 441).  Zimring notes that if one wants to save lives, four approaches can be taken: look for ways to reduce shooting incidents, reduce the number of shots fired, provide immediate medical attention, and transport the victim immediately to a trauma centre., A broader approach to police killings of civilians would be to examine how other (safety) systems learn from rare catastrophic events (such as plane crashes).  Shifting attention from a ‘blame culture’ to a ‘learning culture’ would focus on what organizations can do to reduce harm. “It is the complexity of the high-risk systems that causes extreme harm…. Fatal police shootings shine the spotlight on the shooter rather than the complex organizational processes that recruited, hired, trained, supervised, disciplined, assigned, and dispatched the shooter before anyone faced a split-second decision to shoot” (p. 434).  Focusing on ‘who is to blame’ distracts attention from the manner in which a complex interacting system might have failed., Conclusion: This paper does not offer simple solutions to police shootings, but it does suggest there is need to move beyond the view that simple deterrence (through punishing shooters) will solve the problem. And it suggests there is value in looking at shootings as failures of police systems rather than just failures of individuals.  Fixing systems – involving everything from recruitment and training to the dispatching of officers – may, in the long run, provide more adequate solutions.  “Policing so that all lives actually matter… requires that police, scholars, and the public go back to the drawing board to design a system specifically aimed at placing preservation of life on an equal (and often higher) level with swift enforcement of the law” (p. 441)., Reference: Sherman, Lawrence W.

"Pretrial detention for minor offences is risky both for the accused person and for society.  In comparison to being released while awaiting trial, detention in custody prior to trial for misdemeanour offences appears to be a cause of increased rates of pleading guilty, being sentenced to prison, and committing further crimes when released.","There is no doubt that in many jurisdictions those detained are more likely than those released while awaiting trial to be found guilty, receive longer sentences, and, when released, commit more offences.   This is, of course, what one might expect if those who were detained are more serious offenders.   This article, however, presents evidence that these effects are due to pre-trial detention, not to the nature of the defendant (consistent with Criminological Highlights 17(2)#7). In other words, pretrial detention causes negative outcomes and a higher likelihood of committing more offences., There are a number of reasons why detained defendants might experience worse outcomes than equivalent defendants who achieve pretrial release.  They may plead guilty (whether guilty or not) simply to end their pretrial detention; it is more difficult or impossible for them to prepare a defence or prepare a sentencing plan that would be acceptable to the prosecutor and the court; and they cannot demonstrate positive behaviour in the community.  In terms of reoffending, there is a fair amount of evidence that imprisonment has harmful effects., This study uses data from Harris County, Texas (the third largest county in the US) on 380,689 cases filed between 2008 and 2013. Data on the accused (charges, criminal history, etc.) were combined with information about bail (dollar amount set and whether the accused was released).  These data were linked with data on the defendant’s neighbourhood.  Not surprisingly, accused from poor neighbourhoods were much more likely to be detained, even when looking at those with no previous records. The seriousness of the offence was unrelated to the wealth of the neighbourhood., A regression analysis was carried out to test the effects of pretrial detention on conviction.  Controls were included for the offence, demographics, neighbourhood of residence, criminal history, whether the accused made a claim that they could not afford a lawyer, and the bail amount.   Even with all of these controls, those who were detained in pretrial custody were more likely to be convicted., Similar analyses were carried out on other outcomes: whether the accused pleaded guilty, whether the accused received a prison sentence, and the length of the prison sentence.  In all cases, those who were detained were disadvantaged.  Separate analyses were carried out for various sub-groups: those with and without prior charges, citizens and non-citizens, whites and non-whites, the most serious current offence broken down into 5 categories, three different bail amounts, and the accused’s neighbourhood divided into 4 groups by income level. The disadvantages (conviction, incarceration sentence) showed up for all subgroups.  A separate set of analyses, taking advantage of the fact that people are more likely to be released on certain days of the week demonstrated, once again, that those accused people who were detained were disadvantaged., Conclusion: Those who are not released after arrest are dealt with more harshly by the system.  But in addition, looking at the cumulative effect of being detained on new misdemeanour charges, it is clear that the short term incapacitative impact of being detained is short lived.  Only for the first 19 days after the bail hearing (during which many of the accused who were detained were in jail) is the incidence of misdemeanours for detainees below that of those who obtained release.  After 19 days, those accused who were detained are more likely to have been charged with a misdemeanour (during the period after their bail hearings) than those who were released immediately after their bail hearings.  For new felonies, the incapacitative impact of detention lasts longer.  But three months after their bail hearing, those detained are more likely to have been charged with a felony., Reference: Heaton, Paul, Sandra G.

"There are more firearms owned by Americans than there are adults living in the country.  From a practical perspective, the best strategy to reduce firearms homicides might be to concentrate on methods of making it more difficult to obtain firearms for criminal purposes.",", The crime figure that distinguishes the US most dramatically from most western democracies is its homicide rate.  Firearms play a heavier role (73% of homicides) in the US than in most countries.  Although there are more guns in the US than adult Americans, fewer than a third of US households have any firearms, meaning, obviously, that many gun owners have more than one firearm., Although sales of new firearms – and handguns in particular – have increased dramatically since 2006, the proportion of individuals and households in the US with firearms has been decreasing steadily since 1980.  In 2014 31% of households (22% of individuals) had one or more firearms.  Fewer people now may own more guns but those who do own guns own more of them. To reduce firearms homicides, however, it may be useful to focus on the ease of obtaining one for criminal purposes since reducing overall availability appears to be politically unlikely., The slogan that “guns don’t kill, people do” ignores one important fact:  the ‘case-fatality rate.’ Crimes committed with firearms (especially high caliber firearms) are dramatically more likely to result in death than crimes committed with other weapons (e.g., knives).  The more accurate slogan might be that “people commit offences but guns turn them into homicides.”, It is estimated that only about 10% of firearms used in crime were obtained legally. Most are obtained from friends, family, or from street contacts. Many are borrowed.  “A variety of empirical research suggests that the availability of guns in a community affects the likelihood that a firearm will be used in assaults and robberies” (p. 24). Looking at changes in gun availability across states over time “suggests that more guns lead to more homicides” (p. 24), a result driven entirely by gun homicides.  But it is not a case of ‘more guns – more crime’.  Rather it is simply that the same crime carried out with a gun is much more likely to involve a death., It is also, now, very clear that “deregulation of gun carrying… has undermined public safety” (p. 9), meaning that laws that restrict the ability of people to carry (concealed) firearms appear to be effective.  Most firearms used against people are handguns.  Guns recovered in states with tight firearms legislation (e.g., that restrict in some way easy access to handguns) are likely to come from other states that have few regulations.  When states loosen up their firearms regulations, it turns out that guns from those states become more likely to be used for crime in other states. Furthermore “strong evidence suggests that expansions in the categories of people disqualified from owning guns could save lives” (p. 26).  Gun availability, then, causes deaths., Conclusion: “Gun regulations have… been carefully evaluated and shown effective at reducing criminal misuse of firearms.”   But not all regulations have been shown to be effective. “In particular, jurisdictions that adopt regulations but do not enforce them will be disappointed” (p. 27).  But it needs to be remembered that “the primary consequence of an assailant using a gun rather than a knife… is the likelihood that the attack will be fatal. Guns intensify violence.  In that sense, separating guns from violence can be viewed as a mitigation strategy. The cost of any given volume of violence is keenly sensitive to the types of weapons used”  (p.29)., Reference: Cook Philip J. and Harold A. Pollack (2017).

Experiencing incarceration as a youth has long term negative impacts on adult physical and mental health.,", It is not surprising that youths and adults who are incarcerated have high rates of unmet physical and mental health needs since incarcerated youths and adults are likely to come from economically – and medically – disadvantaged backgrounds.  This paper attempts to determine if incarceration is a likely cause of health problems., There are reasons to suspect that the relationship between incarceration and health may not be causal:  The ‘risk’ factors for poor health and incarceration (e.g., poverty, drug use) may be the same and people with poor health may be at higher risk for incarceration. In this paper, in order to establish a causal ordering of the relationship between incarceration and health, data were used from 14,344 participants in a 14-year longitudinal survey of youth in which the causal ordering could be disentangled., Youths who participated in this survey were classified by how much time (before age 25) they spent incarcerated (none, <1 month, 1-12 months, and >1year) after the first interview and before the final interview.  Health measures were obtained at the first interview (before possible incarceration) and at the final interview (after possible incarceration). Hence it was possible to control for pre-incarceration characteristics of the youth.  Measures of self-reported adult general health, whether the person reported any symptoms of depression, and (at the end of the study) whether the respondent had seriously considered suicide were obtained in the first wave of data collection (prior to when some were incarcerated) and 14 years later (after some had been incarcerated).   Various control variables that are likely to be associated with incarceration and health were obtained including not only the health measures at the beginning of the study but also sociodemographic measures (race, income, education) and various family and school measures., 14% of respondents experienced some incarceration, mostly for short periods.  Even after controlling for demographic variables, connectedness with school and school performance, level of delinquent behaviour, drug use, family structure, parental incarceration, and initial health status, the experience of incarceration was associated with worse adult general health, more depressive symptoms, and suicidal thoughts.  In general, longer periods of incarceration were associated with the worst physical and mental health.   These same effects were found when the study excluded those who were first incarcerated after age 24., Conclusion: The results “suggest that incarceration during adolescence and early adulthood is independently associated with worse physical and mental health outcomes during adulthood. This relationship holds even when accounting for baseline health and key social determinants of health” (p. 7).   The findings in this paper suggest, therefore, that incarceration can have serious long term effects on a person’s health. Given that previous research (e.g., Criminological Highlights 11(4)#3, 12(5)#7, 12(1)#8, 10(6)#1)  has demonstrated that the incarceration of youths does not reduce rates of re-offending, it would appear there is little public safety benefit but substantial harm that can come from unnecessary incarceration., Reference: Barnert, Elizabeth S., Dudovitz, Rebecca, Nelson, Bergen B.  et al. (2017).  How Does Incarcerating young People Affect Their Adult Health Outcomes? Pediatrics [Official Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics], 139(2), 1-10., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV17N3.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-17-no-3-%E2%80%93-june-2018,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 17, No. 3 – June 2018",Regular Issue,2018
Spikes in homicide rates in several US cities following police officer shootings of minority citizens are best explained as being the kind of random variation one expects with relatively rare events.,", Because homicides are rare events, one can expect that there will be a fair amount of volatility in year-to-year rates.   Not surprisingly, we tend to focus on the years in which homicides increase. The years in which homicides decreased pass without notice. Hence, specific theories – such as the suggestion that homicide rates are up because police (in some US cities) are wary about doing ‘proper policing’ — find ‘support’ especially when one looks at small or moderate sized cities because there are always some cities in which homicides increase –sometimes dramatically – in a single year., Using one Canadian metropolitan area (Edmonton) as an example, the number of homicides in the past 10 years shows dramatic year-to-year variation, but little overall trend (number of homicides, 2007-2016: 36, 40, 30, 31, 53, 33, 27, 40, 38, 47).  The problem, in looking only at one year’s rate compared to the previous year is that it is impossible to determine whether recent increases are atypical.  The problem with rare events, of course, is that small locations (e.g., small towns or cities) will almost certainly show the highest and lowest rates simply because small variations in numbers create large variations in rates.    The size of the ‘random error’ is a direct function of the population size.  Random variation, in this context, is analogous to a ‘coin flip’ experiment.  On average, one can expect that people who flip a coin 10 times will be correct in predicting the outcome half the time. But if 100 people each flip a coin 10 times, at least 5 of them would be expected to be correct by chance at least 80% of the time.  Separating chance from psychic powers or other causes is sometimes a challenge., This paper uses homicide data for cities for which complete data were available for a given year from 1960 through 2015.  Clearly anomalous data were excluded (e.g., the 9/11 deaths in New York City). In the end, the focus of the paper is on data from 562 cities with a population of over 100,000 at any point during this period., A model was created for each city estimating the probability distribution of each city’s homicide rate in each year. This was done using the city’s average homicide rate across the period 1960-2014, and the average homicide rate for all cities for a given year. Given that one expects some random variation (everyone in the population has a certain non-zero probability of being a homicide victim), the research question the paper addresses is whether the variation in the rates which are observed in each city for each year is within the range of what would be expected given random variation.  Because of missing data, this resulted in 27,208 city-years in which homicide rates were predicted and available., The model was created using the data from 1960 through 2014.  For that period, the variation between actual and estimated homicide rates was what one would expect based solely on random variation.  Looking at 2015, the number of cities that had homicide rates much higher than was predicted was exactly what one would expect by chance.  But if one looked, in isolation, at some of those ‘higher than expected homicide rate’ cities, some might look for an explanation when an explanation was not needed: the most parsimonious explanation appears to be that there is random variation in the world of crime, as elsewhere., Conclusion: “Many of the potential explanations [for apparently higher than expected homicide rates in some cities] popular in the media appear to be cherry-picked to fit a popular narrative” (p. 135).  There is a tendency to think, when a city’s homicide rate is unusually high, that there is something ‘new’ happening. This ignores what we know about the distribution of unusual events.   The search for ‘causes’ of anomalous looking changes in crime rates needs to be carried out systematically rather than on an ad hoc basis., Reference: Wheeler, Andrew P. and Tomislav V.

The employment and job search activities of men released from prison is not orderly.  Employment after release is often the result of an uncertain and haphazard process that leads to a job that may last only a day or two.,", Employment for those released from prison is hard to obtain not only because of the stigma of being an offender but also because prisoners often do not have skills that lead to continuous, reasonably paid, employment., For low-skilled poorly educated young Black men in US cities, the opportunities for continuous reasonably paid employment are few. One study suggests that only 42% of this group were employed in 2008. Only 26% of those with these characteristics as well as having experienced incarceration were employed.  Temporary jobs, then, become the norm for those who have experienced imprisonment., This paper examines the job search and work experience of 133 men living in Newark, New Jersey who had been released on parole from state prisons.  Men were chosen for the study if they were not gang affiliated, were not sex offenders, and were looking for work. Newark, at that time, had a higher than the state or national unemployment rate.  Participants in the study received gift cards and a smartphone (with a paid service plan) in return for responding twice a day to short surveys received on their smartphones – one survey was sent at a random time between 9am and 6pm and the other at 7pm.  The first survey asked whether they were employed or searching for work (or neither) at that moment.  The survey received at the end of the day asked similar questions but covered the whole day., During the first month after release from prison, people spend about 40% of their daytime hours searching for work, about 10% working and about 50% neither searching for a job nor working.  Over time, however, the proportion of time spent working increased to about 20%, but the amount of time spent searching for work decreased.  More importantly “decreases in search do not coincide with comparable increases in work… Rather the proportion of working days remains low, which suggests that people leave the labour market without much consequence to the amount of work that they find” (p. 1465)., For the most part, the work that people do is not continuous regularly scheduled work. Instead, “work is very irregular, without much change over time and without a clear connection to job search activities” (p. 1468).   The most common pattern of activities is that people search for work early, but “quickly lessen their efforts and conduct few search activities after the first month” (p. 1469).  Most people worked multiple types of very short-term jobs, switching from one type of work to another.  These jobs were not found through systematic job searches., Conclusion: Many men who did not find employment in the first month after release from prison stopped spending time looking for work after about a month, instead depending on occasional short term work that they happened to hear about to make ends meet.  Thus they engaged in any short term work that they happened to come across rather than spending time searching for regular employment.  It would appear that “the critical window of time to support job search [of low skilled released prisoners] is very short” (p. 1477).  Since the reduction in job search activities did not coincide with increases in employment, it would appear that released prisoners did not find work through normal channels.  Clearly employment programs for former prisoners need to take account of the “irregularity, instability, and variability among marginalized job seekers navigating a labour market in which [traditional] work [for which they are qualified] has disappeared” (p. 1481)., Reference: Sugie, Naomi F.

"Programs for youths in conflict with the law aren’t of much value unless they (1) identify the factors related to why the youth offended, (2) match the youth to interventions likely to address those factors, (3) deliver the interventions as they are designed, and (4) do so with an intensity and duration that has been demonstrated to make a difference.",", Youths who commit offences and are, as a result, institutionalized are often provided with rehabilitative programs.  The first challenge is to ensure that the program that is delivered to a specific youth is the appropriate one for that youth.  But once a program is identified, the challenge is to ensure that it is delivered as it was designed and with an intensity and duration that matches what is known to be effective.  This paper examines the importance of the matching of youth with programs., The “risk-need-responsivity” approach to program delivery suggests that reoffending can be reduced in high risk delinquent youths if services are matched to deficits that are amenable to change.  But the desired changes in the youth will not occur unless the program is delivered in a manner and intensity that are consistent with the original program design that was evaluated., A “Standardized Program Evaluation Protocol” established a few years ago evaluated interventions based on the risk level of the youth, the quality/fidelity of the intervention (adherence to the treatment protocol and training of the staff) and the dosage of the treatment that is provided (total hours and number of weeks of treatment)., This study looked at data from 344 youths who had been incarcerated in Florida youth facilities and were released in 2014/15.   All youths received at least one intervention for one of the youth’s 3 highest ranked criminological needs. This group of youths received the target number of actual treatment hours recommended for the intervention and the treatment continued for the recommended number of weeks.   They were successfully matched (with a technique called propensity score matching) with youths who were similar, but had not received treatment deemed to have all the necessary characteristics (i.e., appropriate to their needs and applied adequately).  Recidivism was defined as a youth adjudication or adult conviction within one year of being released from the youth custodial facility. Those data show that the two groups were very similar on various background character and risks/needs., The one year recidivism rate was 56% for the youths who did not receive the appropriate treatment or for whom the treatment was not delivered as recommended.  For those who received the treatment they needed and the treatment was delivered in the intensity that was recommended, the recidivism rate declined to 47%.   Analyses of risks (e.g., social skills deficits or alcohol/drug use) supported the conclusion that program appropriateness and intensity are both important factors in achieving change., Conclusion:  The findings underline the importance of individualized matching of services to the specific needs of a youth, rather than addressing the general needs of all youths who find themselves in a youth custody facility.  But in addition, “receiving adequate dosages of matched services for adequate lengths of time matters” (p. 55).  Although the modest reduction in reoffending found in this study (about 15% fewer recidivists in the group that received proper treatment) may not seem large, these data clearly show that properly delivered treatment is better than no treatment or treatment inappropriately assigned and/or delivered., Reference: Baglivio, Michael T., Kevin T.

"The greater the availability of construction and manufacturing jobs in the community into which male prisoners are released from California’s prisons, the greater the decrease in subsequent offending.",", The relationship between employment and crime is not a simple one, though previous studies (e.g., Criminological Highlights 8(4)#4, 16(6)#3, 15(5)#3) suggest they are related in complex ways.  This study looks at the impact on recidivism of  increases in the availability of employment in certain job sectors at the time a person is released from prison., Thousands of people are released from prisons each month.  The assumption often made is that if they are able to find a job soon after release, they will be less likely to reoffend.  However, examining employment opportunities by looking only at overall employment (or unemployment) rates in a community may not be useful since many jobs are not available to former inmates, and many low wage jobs (especially part-time jobs) are not likely to attract prisoners if the jobs do not provide adequate income for them to support themselves., This paper, therefore, looks at the impact of the number of people starting a job within specific industries within commuting distance of the location to which a prisoner was released.  “New hires” at the time of the release of a prisoner were categorized in various ways.  First they were categorized by whether the job category required high or low skills.   Then, the low-skill hires were broken down by type of industry.  The most important distinction was between construction and manufacturing low-skill new hires, on the one hand, and all other low-skill new hires (e.g., retail, food services), on the other hand., The results demonstrate a small, but statistically significant, impact on recidivism of the availability of low skill construction and manufacturing jobs in the community at the time a prisoner was released. For example, “the hiring of one construction worker per 1,000 working-age individuals in a commuting zone [where a newly released prisoner who had been incarcerated for drug crimes was living] at the time of release [of the prisoner] decreases recidivism by 1.5%” (p. 460).  More generally, new construction and/or manufacturing low-skill hires in the area in which a newly released prisoner lived tended to reduce repeat drug, property and violent offending. The results suggest that job availability to newly released prisoners in specific industries reduces certain kinds of re-offending. The exact mechanisms that account for this effect were not examined in this study., Conclusion: “Individuals recently released from prison adjust their behaviour in response to changes in certain types of labour market opportunities” (p. 466).  The availability of low-skill construction and manufacturing jobs that pay relatively well appears to lead to reduced recidivism.  The findings suggest that the quality of employment possibilities for former prisoners is at least as important as the simple quantity of jobs, overall, that might be theoretically available to recently released prisoners.  From a policy perspective, then, policies that increase the availability of reasonably paid jobs for people re-entering society from prison would appear to contribute to reduced reoffending., Reference: Schnepel, Kevin T.

"When Canadian youths found guilty of homicide offences are released from prison, their offending patterns are indistinguishable from those who were imprisoned for non-homicide offences.",", Although youth homicide offenders are sometimes portrayed as being especially likely to commit other serious offences, their developmental risk factors tend to be very similar to those of other serious and violent offenders., This paper examines the offending of youths convicted of a homicide offence who were subsequently released from custodial sentences in comparison to other youths with serious criminal records: those incarcerated for violent offences other than homicide and those incarcerated for non-violent offences.  Specifically, it examined, among other things, the overall recidivism rates of these three groups after release and whether there is a specific offending trajectory for youth homicide offenders that differs from that of other serious and violent youths released from custody., The focus of the study is on youths released from British Columbia (Canada) custodial facilities.  The sample of youth ‘homicide’ offenders (youths convicted of murder, manslaughter or attempted murder) was relatively small (n=26), but that reflects the fact that these cases are rare in British Columbia. In British Columbia, only 25 youths were sentenced to custody for a murder/manslaughter and an additional 8 for attempted murder in the 10 years ending in 2000., Prior to their conviction for the homicide offence, youth homicide offenders had fewer previous offences than other violent and non-violent young offenders who ended up in British Columbia’s youth prisons.  This finding is in line with other studies of youth homicide offenders., When gender and ethnicity were taken into account (and in a separate analysis that looked only at males), there was no association between offender type (homicide, other violent, non-violent) and adult recidivism.  Offending patterns for these offenders were examined throughout the life course.  Four trajectories were identified:  adolescent limited, stable relatively low rate offenders, high rate offenders who by about age 25 became indistinguishable from adolescent limited offenders, and high rate persisting offenders whose rates decreased but by the time they were in their mid-late 20s were still higher than the other groups.  Youth homicide offenders were distributed across these groups at equivalent rates to youth non-homicide offenders., Conclusion: The findings from this study “stand in contrast to early clinical conceptions of youth homicide offenders as a homogeneous and uniquely dangerous group with a propensity for serious violence…” (p. 31).  In reality, these Canadian youth homicide offenders were indistinguishable in their reoffending rates and patterns from other youths who were incarcerated during the same period.  The findings suggest that from an offending perspective, the fact that these youths have committed the most serious criminal offense possible does not appear to make them more likely to offend after they have served their sentences and been returned to the community., Reference:  McCuish, Evan C., Jesse Cale, and Raymond R.

"Increases in the concentration of undocumented immigrants within states in the US are not associated with increases in violence. Indeed, if anything, increases in concentration of undocumented immigrants are associated with decreases in violent crime.","There is substantial evidence that residents of those locations lucky enough to attract large concentrations of immigrants receive a benefit: crime is reduced (see Criminological Highlights 5(4)#6, 10(6)#7, 11(1)#4, 13(6)#7, 14(1)#8, 16(1)#2, 17(1)#3.   However, previous studies have examined those who are (largely) “legal” immigrants.  This paper, using new estimates of the concentration of “undocumented” immigrants in the US, examines the effect of changes in their concentration on violent crime between 1990 and 2014., “Immigration is said to reduce crime and violence by attracting immigrants with low criminal propensities, strengthening local economies and bolstering processes of informal social control.” Undocumented immigration may be different however, since “Unlike their documented counterparts, [they] are hindered from effectively forming economic and social ties as a result of their lack of legal standing in the community” (p. 372).  In the US, they are denied all forms of federal assistance, are largely excluded from the formal labour market, and have limited opportunities for upward mobility., Two different techniques have been used to estimate the number of undocumented immigrants. Essentially these approaches each subtract the number of authorized or documented immigrants from the estimates of the foreign born population in a given location. The two different methods show high correlations across years, within state (r=.93)., The analysis examines changes in the number of undocumented immigrants and violent crime, within states (and the District of Columbia), across years 1990 to 2014.  Various controls are included –  e.g., lawful immigration, structural disadvantage, unemployment rate, percent of the population that is young, firearms availability, police strength, and year (since, generally, crime was decreasing while undocumented immigration increased). With or without the controls, as concentrations of undocumented immigrants increased, the rate of violent crime decreased.  “A standard deviation increase in undocumented immigration is associated with .37 standard deviation decrease in violent crime” (p. 384) an effect which is quite large. It is important to note that “The [favourable] effects of unauthorized immigration are in addition to the significant reductions in violent crime stemming from lawful immigration” (p. 384). It was demonstrated that the effects are not driven by undocumented immigrants selecting locations to avoid violence., The analyses were repeated using National Crime Victimization Survey data (using 3 year averages) and the results were similar. Hence the findings do not appear to be due to differential reporting to the police. The results of the full set of analyses “seriously undermine claims that violent crime has increased as a result of undocumented immigration” (p. 390)., Conclusion:  People who can’t easily be counted or identified publicly are easy targets for blame for crime, among other social problems.  The findings from this study show no support whatsoever for the view that violent crime increases when undocumented immigration increases in a US state.  Indeed most of the findings suggest the opposite: that the effects of increased undocumented immigration to a state (or Washington, D.C.) are the same as increases in legal immigration: crime decreases.  It’s too bad that the President of the US neither looks at evidence nor subscribes to Criminological Highlights., Reference: Light, Michael T. and Ty Miller (2018).  Does Undocumented Immigration Increase Violent Crime?  Criminology, 56(2), 370-401., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV17N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-17-no-4-%E2%80%93-august-2018,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 17, No. 4 – August 2018",Regular Issue,2018
"Prohibiting employers from asking about criminal records on job applications might appear to be a good way of giving those with criminal records a chance at getting a job. Paradoxically, these well-meaning policies appear to disadvantage certain already-disadvantaged people: young, Black or Hispanic, unskilled males.",", Allowing those who have been convicted of a criminal offence a chance of getting a job is obviously not only fair, but is likely to be an important step in the reintegration process.  However, it appears that some employers are reluctant even to consider those with criminal records., Between 2004 and 2014, therefore, some cities and states instituted ‘ban the box’ (BTB) policies where applicants cannot be forced on their initial applications to indicate they have criminal records. This study took advantage of the fact that BTB policies came in at different times in different locations.  Looking across time, within locations that have and do not have BTB policies, the study used large employment surveys to examine the employment rates of relatively unskilled non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, and Hispanic young men., The possible risk of BTB policies is that employers – no longer being able to identify those with criminal records – will instead screen out (and not consider) those whom they think might have criminal records:  young, unskilled, Black/Hispanic men.  Hence even though BTB policies might have been instituted to help these groups, they could, paradoxically, hurt their chances., The analysis looked at the monthly employment rates of these three groups for 18 months before and 18 months after BTB policies were instituted. In order to create comparison non-BTB locations, employment rates for the three groups were examined in locations without BTB policies for 18 months before and after the average date of the implementation of BTB policies elsewhere (October 2010)., The results were clear.  For White men, there was no apparent impact of the implementation of BTB policies: employment rates did not change in locations with the implementation of BTB policies. Indeed, employment rates during the 36 month period were comparable for BTB and non-BTB locations.   For Blacks and Hispanic men, however, the employment rates in BTB and non-BTB cities were comparable before the implementation of BTB.  But after the BTB rules were adopted, employment rates for relatively unskilled Black and Hispanic young men decreased and were significantly lower than the employment rates for these men in non-BTB cities., Conclusion:  It appears that for vulnerable groups – young, relatively unskilled Black and Hispanic men – Ban-the-Box policies had harmful effects. These policies were designed to allow job applicants to be considered for employment rather than being immediately rejected because of a criminal record. Given that many employers are worried about hiring people who have criminal records, it would appear that when they are prohibited from asking for this information, they may avoid doing interviews with people whom they assume are likely to have criminal records.  Young, unskilled Blacks are about 3.4% less likely to be employed after these policies are brought in; the comparable figure for Hispanics is 2.3%.  There seemed to be no benefit (or harm) to comparable White job seekers., Reference: Doleac, Jennifer L. and Benjamin Hansen (2016).  Does “Ban the Box” Help or Hurt Low-Skilled Workers?  Statistical Discrimination and Employment Outcomes When Criminal Histories are Hidden.

"More guns, more accidental firearms deaths.",", In December 2012, a lone shooter entered Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut and killed 20 children and 6 adults.   Five days later, the president of the US, Barack Obama, suggested that it was important to find ways of using new federal legislation to restrict access to guns. He discussed specific legislative proposals in January and in his February 2013 State of the Union address., This paper examines firearms acquisition and accidental deaths in the immediate aftermath of the Sandy Hook shootings.  “Previous research has demonstrated that accidental shootings are more likely to occur when there are more guns in the home, during routine handling of a firearm, when a gun is not stored properly, and when people are playing with guns or demonstrating their use.  Children may be particularly at risk” (p. 1324)., Interest in purchasing firearms was thought to be heightened because of Obama’s suggestion of new restrictions on their purchase.  In the months immediately following the Sandy Hook shootings (December 2012-April 2013) there was a dramatic spike in Google searches that included “buy gun” (e.g., “Where can I buy a gun?”) and “clean gun” (e.g., “How often should I clean my gun?”). Rates of these searches were dramatically higher than they had been at any time between 2010 and the end of 2014.   The correlation between the volume of these searches was +0.72 .  In addition, ‘background checks’ (necessary in some locations for purchases of a firearm from a licensed firearms dealer), a measure that had previously been shown to relate to firearms purchases, also spiked during this same period and correlated highly with the Google searches on ‘buy gun’.  In addition, California sales data suggest that an additional 26,000-33,000 handguns were purchased in that state in the 6 weeks after the Sandy Hook killings. Most of these sales were by first-time purchasers. Across the US (population 316 million in 2013), it is estimated that approximately 3 million additional guns were sold during this 5 month period., Using Vital Statistics data (which record causes of death), it was discovered that there was a spike in accidental firearms deaths during the 5-month window when purchases of firearms spiked.  There were no other spikes in firearms accidental deaths in any other period between 2010 and 2014. In all, using two different methods of estimating the number of additional deaths, it would seem that there were between 57 and 66 additional firearms accidental deaths in the US in this 5-month period, with 18-22 of them being children (age 14 and under).  The spikes in accidental firearms deaths occurred precisely where one would expect: in states with (estimated) large per capita sales increases., Conclusion: It is sometimes suggested that “Guns don’t kill, people do.”   As noted elsewhere (Criminological Highlights 17(3)#2) crimes carried out with firearms are more likely to result in deaths than comparable crimes carried out with other weapons.  The data in this study demonstrate that there are measurable dangers from firearms even when they are not being used in relation to a violent crime.  The easy access to firearms after the Sandy Hook school shootings, and the belief that access might be made more difficult, led to a spike in firearms sales in the US.  This increase in firearms in ordinary homes led to increased numbers of firearms accidents, most notably, involving children. More generally, the data demonstrate the risk of accidental deaths that flow directly from firearms possession. Guns kill., Reference: Levine, Phillip B. and Robin McKnight (8 December 2017).

"The differentiation between “life-course persistent” and “adolescent-limited” male offenders, first made in 1993, is still useful 25 years later. The need to shape policies in a manner that is consistent with our knowledge of these two very different groups is more clear than it was 25 years ago.",", “Antisocial adults virtually always begin as children with antisocial misconduct, but most young people who engage in antisocial misconduct do not grow up to be antisocial adults” (p. 177).  An important 1993 paper made this point. This paper reviews evidence since then and serves as a reminder that the causes of “life course persistent” and “adolescent limited” offending are very different., Using reports from parents and teachers about children from age 5 to age 11, and combining these data with self-reports, police-reports and parent and teacher reports of antisocial behaviour in mid-adolescence, two groups of offending youths can be identified.  In mid-adolescence, the anti-social behaviour rates of these two groups are generally indistinguishable.  But one group had experienced early risks (e.g., parental mental health problems, single parent families, harsh discipline, neurological abnormalities, reading and memory deficits, hyperactivity, fighting, peer rejection).  The other group had not.  Both groups of youths who engaged in anti-social behaviour were likely to have delinquent friends., However, by age 26, the “adolescent limited” youths, who did not experience these early risks and deficits, were much less likely to engage in violent or non-violent offending than the “life course persistent” youths.  Said differently, the behaviour in mid-adolescence was, for the two groups, likely to be caused by, and under the control of, very different factors. Equally important, perhaps, is the fact that looking only at the delinquent behaviour of a youth does not allow one to determine which group a youth might fall in., Although there is some evidence that “life course persistent behaviour is characterized by difficulties in the brain’s mental functions, particularly its verbal and executive functions… decisive tests of the hypothesis that neural abnormality should characterize life course persistent but not adolescent limited individuals are lacking” (p. 183). It has been suggested that what drives adolescent limited offending “is a gap between biological and social maturation… measured as the discrepancy between pubertal age and the amount of autonomy each teen reported” (p. 183).  In young adulthood, some adolescent limited individuals “had continued difficulties, particularly related to substance abuse” but typically, in the end, have “ordinary life outcomes.”  However, this delay suggests that in our society “the transition from adolescence to adulthood has elongated” (p. 183) and there is some evidence that the peak rate of crime for adolescent limited males is occurring slightly later than was the case in the 1980s., Conclusion: Looking back at the distinction between life course persistent and adolescent limited offending, at least two conclusions might be drawn.  First, since individual development appears to be one driver of serious life course persistent (male) offending there is a need for early-childhood prevention aimed at families and schools. Second, there is “the need to appreciate heterogeneity within adolescent offenders, to distinguish the few who have adverse backgrounds from the many who have ordinary backgrounds and a better prognosis” (p. 183).  From society’s perspective, social interventions to reduce the number of life course persistent offenders are considerably more cost effective if they are well targeted on this relatively small group.  At the same time the information about adolescent limited antisocial behaviour “provides impetus for movements to reform juvenile-justice and mental-health services in directions that are more supportive for young people” (p. 183-4)., Reference:  Moffitt, Terri E.  (2018).

"Politics matter in sentencing. Federal judges appointed by Republican presidents in the US are not always tougher on defendants: they give harsher sentences to black offenders than Democrat-appointed judges, but more lenient sentences, overall, to women.",", There are data that suggest that even in fairly strict sentencing guideline systems (e.g., the US federal guidelines) disadvantaged groups are treated more harshly.  Furthermore, there are systematic differences across judges and prosecutors in the sentences that offenders receive (see Criminological Highlights 5(3)#6, 15(5)#4).  This paper examines whether judges’ sentencing decisions vary in systematic ways by looking at the political party of the president who appointed the judge., Concern about the politicization of judicial appointments in many countries (notably in the US) makes it important to see what the impact might be of having a large number of judges appointed by any given political party.  One might have thought that in guideline systems like the US federal guidelines, where the ‘presumptive range’ of sentences for a given offence/criminal record combination is relatively narrow (e.g., typically the top of the range is about 20-25% higher than the bottom of the presumptive range), judges would be fairly constrained in their sentencing and the political leader responsible for their appointment would not matter.  This paper suggests that this is wrong: politics matter., This paper used data from the United States Sentencing Commission which had many characteristics of the case, but did not include the identity of the judge.  Using other data obtained through freedom of information requests, the identity of the judge could be determined in over half a million cases decided between 1999 and 2015.  44% of the cases were decided by judges appointed by Democratic presidents. Democrat-appointed judges were more likely than Republican-appointed judges to be Black and/or female.  The cases sentenced by Democrat-appointed judges did not differ appreciably from the cases sentenced by Republican-appointed judges., “Republican appointed judges give black offenders an additional 3.0 months in prison compared to non-black offenders, relative to Democratic judges in the same district court…  Republican judges give female offenders 2.1 fewer months in prison compared to males, relative to Democratic judges” (page 13).  These results hold even when the ‘final offence level’ of the case is controlled for. This means that even though judges might not formally depart from the ‘guideline range’, blacks, relative to whites, as well as men relative to women, tend to be treated more harshly by Republican judges than Democratic judges.  The gender effects – Republican judges being more lenient, relatively speaking, with women – are driven largely by violent and drug offences.  The race effects – Republican judges being relatively harsh in their sentencing of blacks — are driven largely by drug and property offences. Various analytical techniques were used in the study to ensure that the results were not related to any specific method of examining the data., In 2005, the US Supreme Court (US v. Booker) made the guidelines more advisory than mandatory though judges were required to take the guidelines into account.  After this case had been decided, racial and gender disparities by judge political affiliation became larger.  The difference between the sentences for black and white offenders sentenced by Republican judges increased to 4.8 extra months in prison, compared to sentences from Democratic judges., Conclusion: Judicial ideology – in this study operationalized by whether a judge was appointed by a Republican or Democratic president — makes a difference.  The precise reasons that blacks, relative to whites, are treated more harshly by Republican appointed judges and women, relative to men, are treated more leniently by Republican appointed judges are not clear.  The study suggests, then, that part of the reason that sentencing disparity still exists in sentencing guideline systems is that judges are able systematically to sentence according to what apparently are their political beliefs., Reference: Cohen, Alma and Crystal S.

"Police contacts with youth can have negative effects on perceptions of procedural injustice, willingness to report crimes to the police, support for the use of violence in response to problems, and reported delinquency.",", There is substantial empirical support for the conclusion that fair treatment by the police can be both “a form of crime control” (p. 403) and have other beneficial effects (see Criminological Highlights 7(2)#4, 11(4)#1, 11(5)#1, 15(1)#5, 15(4)#3, 17(2)#4). This paper uses data from a longitudinal survey of Black, White, and Latino urban youths in 7 US cities to examine some of the potentially harmful effects of criminal justice contact when that contact is not experienced in a favourable light., High school youths’ experiences in encounters they have had with the police in the previous 6 months were categorized in one of four different ways (with the most recent stop being examined if they had been stopped more than once): No police-initiated stops, police-initiated stops in which they were satisfied or very satisfied, stops in which they were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, or police-initiated stops in which they were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied., They were also asked not only for their perceptions of procedural justice, but also whether they would be likely to report crimes they witness to the police and their belief in the need for violent self-help (e.g., whether it is all right to use violence when another person “hit you first” or is “threatening to hurt your family”). Finally, a year later, the youths were asked about their involvement in 11 different forms of delinquent behaviour., For all three groups of youths (White, Black, and Latino), unsatisfactory treatment by the police led to perceptions that the police generally were procedurally unjust (discourteous, disrespectful, dishonest). For Whites and Latinos, receiving neutral or unsatisfactory treatment from the police led to a lower willingness to report crime to the police. However, being stopped by the police had no impact on willingness to report crime to the police for Black youth. In general, being stopped by the police increased youths’ support for the personal use of violence, with relatively little variation due to youths’ characterization of the interaction.  Youths who were stopped and, in particular, those youths who reported unsatisfactory treatment from the police were more likely to engage in delinquencies a year later., All of these effects controlled for youths’ assessment of procedural justice more than a year before the police stop that was the subject of this study. In other words, the effects appear to be caused by the youths’ recent experiences with the police.  Various demographic variables were controlled for as well (e.g., household structure, residential mobility, parental education).  Personal characteristics such as impulsivity, monitoring by parents, prosocial peers, victimization as well as youths’ experiences and performance in schools and whether they had participated in a program designed to keep youths from joining gangs were, in addition, included as controls.  Finally, the city the youth was in and various neighbourhood characteristics (e.g., racial mix of the neighbourhood, economic disadvantage and disorder in the school and neighbourhood) were included in a long list of factors that were statistically controlled. In other words, it seems likely that the effects that were observed were the direct result of police treatment of youths, not these other factors., Conclusion:  In general, “youth who were stopped or arrested and were dissatisfied with how they were treated had more negative outcomes [lower willingness to report crimes, increased willingness to use violence in personal disputes, and increased involvement in delinquency] when compared with those with no police contact regardless of their race/ethnicity….  For Whites and Latinos, even neutral contacts seem to weaken their relationship with the law and mainstream norms” (p. 422). For Black youths, on the other hand, it may be that they see people like them targeted by the police so regularly, that neutrally-rated police contact has little additional negative impact., Reference: Slocum, Lee Ann and Stephanie Ann Wiley (2018). “Experience of the Expected?” Race and Ethnicity Differences in the Effects of Police Contact on Youth. Criminology, 56(2). 402-432., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV17N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-17-no-4-%E2%80%93-august-2018,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 17, No. 4 – August 2018",Regular Issue,2018
"The imprisonment rate in England and Wales rose substantially between 1990 and 2011 and has been relatively steady since then, notwithstanding a number of changes that have taken place in sentencing in recent decades and a 21% decrease in the number of people being sentenced between 2004 and 2014.",", In recent years, there have been a number of important changes in the sentencing of criminal cases in England & Wales including the development of sentencing guidelines, the development of a new non-prison sanction (the ‘suspended sentence order’),  and the development and then abolition of an ‘indeterminate sentence’ in cases not eligible for a life sentence., In 2003, Britain’s Parliament changed the requirements for the use of a ‘suspended sentence order’ in order to increase its availability (and presumably capture some of the ‘immediate custody’ sentences that did not really need to end up in Britain’s prisons). Prior to this, the suspended sentence order was only available in exceptional circumstances and was almost never used. There was a large increase in the use of this option apparently as a result of this change in the law. Looking at the more serious category of cases (indictable offences), suspended sentences went from being used in 1% of all cases in 2003 to 14% of all cases in 2014.  One might think that this would result in less use of ordinary custodial sentences.  It did not. Immediate custody (ordinary prison) sentences also were more frequently used.  Ordinary prison sentences were imposed in 24% of indictable offence cases in 2003 and 27% of cases in 2014.   Most of the shift to suspended sentence orders came from an explicitly non-custodial choice: the ‘community sentence’., In 2002, apparently believing in the efficiency of incapacitation as a crime control strategy, Britain’s Parliament enacted the indeterminate sentence of “Imprisonment for public protection” (IPP) which could be imposed on any person convicted of any of 153 specified offences (some with maximum sentences of only 3 years). By 2008, it became clear that it was being used more than expected.  By 2012, when the indeterminate sentence was abolished, those subject to an IPP sentence constituted 44% of those serving life/indeterminate sentences and 7% of the total prison population., English guidelines are offence specific and are structured in a very different manner from American ‘grid’ guidelines.  The first guideline was issued in 2011.  Judges are required to follow a formal process to arrive at a sentence, starting with an assessment of the relative seriousness of the harm that was done and the culpability of the accused.  Then other factors (e.g., criminal record, a guilty plea) are considered.  Hence judges “must… follow any sentencing guidelines which are relevant to the offender’s case” (p. 337), but at the same time judges are allowed to depart from the guideline “if following the guideline would be contrary to the interests of justice” (p. 337).  Control of prison populations through guidelines was seen as impractical and perhaps inappropriate.  Hence this is not a goal of the English guidelines., The tension between judges’ beliefs and practices, one the one hand, and principled guidelines on the other hand can be seen by the response, in 2011, to a wave of urban riots in England. Judges responded by handing down “strikingly harsher sentences in order to deter future cases” (p. 342).  England’s Sentencing Council followed judicial practice by subsequently adding the aggravating factor of “offence committed during a period of social disorder” to all subsequent guidelines. Sentence lengths in Crown Court for violent sexual offences also increased, a change that “appears unrelated to the guidelines per se” (p. 338)., Conclusion: Many changes have occurred in sentencing in England & Wales since 2000.  Some of the effects are familiar (e.g., new non-prison sanctions not reducing the use of ordinary prison sentences).  Some, such as the English guidelines, are less familiar.  The examination of the effects of these changes on imprisonment, however, serve as a reminder of the somewhat unpredictable relationship between legal change and changes in imprisonment., Reference: Roberts, Julian V. and Andrew Ashworth (2016).  The Evolution of Sentencing Policy and Practice in England & Wales. Crime and Justice: A Review of Research, 45, 307-358., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV17N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-17-no-4-%E2%80%93-august-2018,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 17, No. 4 – August 2018",Regular Issue,2018
Involvement with the criminal justice system as a high school student decreases the likelihood of having a good education and a well-paying job at age 25-32 – especially for those youths who grew up in relatively high socioeconomic status families.,", There is little doubt that contact with the criminal justice system has negative impacts on people’s lives and the lives of their families long after the immediate consequences are over. This study examines how prior criminal justice experiences, ranging from having been stopped by the police to being incarcerated, affects socioeconomic attainment. In addition, it examines whether the effects, if any, vary across youths coming from different socioeconomic backgrounds., Previous research has shown that being arrested in adolescence is associated with a reduced likelihood of obtaining a high school degree and increased likelihood of eventually being on welfare.  But there is no reason to expect that the effects of criminal justice involvement are going to be uniform for all youths.  One could hypothesize that the harmful effects of criminal justice contact for a youth would be smaller for advantaged youths because they have additional (family) resources to draw on to overcome the negative impact.  Alternatively, one might predict the opposite: that the effects would be larger for youths from advantaged homes because criminal justice involvement is, for them, more stigmatizing or that it is less common and therefore youths from advantaged families have less experience in dealing with the consequences of this contact., This study uses data obtained from a longitudinal study in which the first interview took place when youths were approximately age 12-19.  The youths were followed and data were collected again when they were age 25-32.   The main focus of this study is on their educational attainment and occupational status (ranging from being unemployed to having a high status job).   Data on criminal justice involvement were collected when the youths were age 18-26 and were coded in terms of the ‘depth’ of involvement in the criminal justice system.  This ranged from there being no contact to being stopped for non-traffic matters, charged, convicted, given a non-jail/prison sentence, or sentenced to jail/prison.   Parental socioeconomic status was coded from the data collected when the youth was first interviewed (at age 12-19).   Various other demographic factors (e.g., race/ethnicity, whether the youth lived with biological parents) were used as control factors., The results show that as criminal justice involvement increased (from no involvement, at one end of the spectrum, to being incarcerated at the other end) the achieved socioeconomic status of the youth (at age 25-32) was reduced.  This effect was dramatically larger for the youths who grew up in relatively advantaged families.  Said differently, criminal justice involvement hurts advantaged youths more than it hurts less advantaged youths.  But in general, the deeper the level of criminal justice involvement for all groups, the less likely they were to achieve high socioeconomic status (measured as educational attainment or employment status). One might think that youths from advantaged homes will experience the greatest loss from criminal justice involvement, but still achieve more than their lower socioeconomic status counterparts. For those who managed to make it through adolescence and early adulthood without criminal justice involvement or with low forms of involvement, parental socioeconomic status predicts the youth’s educational and employment achievements.   But as involvement in the criminal justice system deepens, the differences between youths of different socioeconomic backgrounds disappears., Conclusion:  These data demonstrate that there are long-term – perhaps lifetime – negative consequences of deep levels of criminal justice involvement, in particular being convicted of a crime and incarcerated. Youths who have been convicted or incarcerated show lower educational and employment achievement when they are age 25-32.   These effects are particularly pronounced for youths who come from advantaged families., Reference: Dennison, Christopher R. and Stephen Demuth (2018).  The More You Have, The More You Lose: Criminal Justice Involvement, Ascribed Socioeconomic Status, and Achieved SES.  Social Problems, 65, 195-210., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV17N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-17-no-4-%E2%80%93-august-2018,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 17, No. 4 – August 2018",Regular Issue,2018
High rates of aggressive policing result in lower rates of voter turnout in English cities.,"Previous research has demonstrated that imprisonment can have harmful effects both on those imprisoned and on their families (see The Effects of Imprisonment: Specific Deterrence and Collateral Effects on our website). Recent research (e.g., Criminological Highlights 14(4)#1) has demonstrated that contact with the justice system, and imprisonment in particular, reduces people’s level of political engagement. This paper suggests that high levels of aggressive policing activities in a neighbourhood can reduce voter turnout in that neighbourhood., This study examines two types of aggressive policing.  First, it examines the use of anti-social behaviour (ASBs) policing in which the police are encouraged to target any behaviour “that caused or was likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to one or more persons not of the same household [as the perpetrator]” (p. 1235).  The police then can use legal means to put orders on citizens to stop this behaviour, even if the behaviour itself would not normally be considered to be criminal.  Second, it examines “stop and search” actions by the police. It was suggested that these two forms of aggressive policing activities could cause political resentment or alienation in a neighbourhood because both actions are fundamentally adversarial in nature, they are targeted at people in particular neighbourhoods, and they are largely perceived to be illegitimate and/or unfair., Data were obtained on ASB policing and voter turnout in three years (2012, 2014, and 2016) in over 500 wards in Metropolitan London.  Data on stop-and-search activities in over 300 wards (in 2015 and  2016) in each of Greater Manchester and the West Midlands were also gathered.  Various characteristics of the wards (variables presumed to be related to voting) were included as controls. These included housing (percent homeowners, average housing price, percent social housing), percent single-parent households, unemployment, ethnic background and education.   The goal was to examine, above and beyond these control variables, the impact of ASB activities and stop and search by police on ward-level voter turnout, The effects on voter turnout were consistent across types of policing and years: large numbers of ASB stops per capita and large numbers of stop-and-searches per capita in a city ward were associated with lower rates of voter turnout in that ward. Specifically, with respect to ASB policing, it was estimated that if the ward with the lowest rate of ASB policing were, instead, to have received the highest rate, this would have resulted in a 3-4 percent reduction in voter turnout in that ward. The effects of stop-and-search policing were similar, though somewhat smaller (between a 1.2% and 2.6% reduction in voter turnout)., Surprisingly, “the results suggest that as the Black, Asian and Muslim share of the population [in a ward] increases, the demoralizing effect of community-level [ASB and stop-and-search] policing diminishes” (p. 1246). The exception was that, for one year, the effect of stop-and-search policing on reducing voter turnout was greater as the percent Black in that ward increased.   More generally, of course, the focus of the study was on ward-level policing activities and ward-level voter turnout rather than the impact of being a recipient of a particular kind of policing and individual voter turnout. Hence the experiences of different groups on voting could not be assessed., Conclusion: The effects of aggressive policing (the policing of anti-social behaviour and police stop-and searches) on civic engagement (e.g., voting) have previously only been explored in the US and the effects have often been explained within that country’s history of high imprisonment rates and voter suppression/ disenfranchisement.  These results demonstrate that each of these forms of aggressive policing can reduce political engagement in other countries as well – in this case, England.  More importantly, the results of this paper “suggest that the demobilizing relationship between criminal justice contact and political participation is more fundamental than previously characterized….” (p. 1250)., Reference: Laniyonu, Ayobami (2018).

The killing of unarmed Black Americans by the police has broad negative impacts on the mental health of Black Americans who live in the state in which the killing took place.,", It is estimated that in about 29% of police killings of Black Americans, the victim was unarmed.  The comparable figure for White Americans is 19%.  This study examines the short-term impact of police killings of unarmed Black Americans on the mental health of Black Americans living in the state in which the person was killed., “A large literature has shown associations between racism and health outcomes” (p. 302), but it has been difficult to test whether this relationship is causal.  In this study, by taking advantage of the essentially random nature of the timing of police shootings of ordinary black citizens and comparing the impact on Black and White Americans of shootings of armed and unarmed Black and White citizens, causal inferences can be made with more confidence., In an ongoing telephone survey (the US Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System) between 2013-2016, approximately a million American adults (about 10% of whom were Black) were asked, among other things, how many days in the previous 30 days was their mental health ‘not good’ (p. 304). It was demonstrated that the timing of police killings is unrelated to other factors that might influence mental health.  Nevertheless, controls were included for year, month, day of the week when the interview took place, age, sex, and education., The hypothesis was that police shootings of apparently unarmed Black people in a respondent’s community (defined conservatively as within the same state as the respondent) that occurred recently (within the previous 3 months) would lead to increased reports of ‘not good’ mental health., The results are simple to describe: When Black Americans are exposed to one or more police killings of other unarmed Black Americans in their own state in the previous 90 days they are more likely to report higher numbers of days in which their mental health was ‘not good.’ In line with the idea that the harmful effects of these shootings are likely to be due to “heightened perceptions of threat and vulnerability, lack of fairness, lower social status, [and/or] lower beliefs about one’s own worth” (p. 308), it was found that there were no significant effects of police killings of armed Black Americans.  Similarly, police killings of White (armed or unarmed) Americans had no impact on the mental health of  Black Americans.   Furthermore, there were no significant effects of the killing of Black or White, armed or unarmed, residents on the reported mental health of White Americans., Further support of the hypothesis that police killings of unarmed Black Americans caused a decline in mental health came from the fact that the decline in mental health of Black Americans only occurred after the police shooting.  Those Black Americans who were interviewed prior to a police killing of an unarmed Black American showed no impact., Conclusion: Police killings of unarmed Black people were associated with worse mental health of Black Americans in the three months following the shooting, compared to ratings of mental health by similarly placed Black Americans who did not live in a location where such an event occurred in the previous 3 months.  The effect that was measured is probably less strong than the total impact, since the ‘comparison’ areas – those without a police killing of an unarmed Black person – were often exposed to the same media information. “The results provide rare causal evidence about the impact of events widely perceived to reflect structural racism on the mental health of Black Americans” (p. 308)., Reference: Bor, Jacob, Atheendar S.

"Pretrial detention has harmful effects for both the defendant and society more generally: it increases the likelihood that a person will plead guilty to a felony and, in the long run, increases reoffending after the case is completed.",", In the United States, one out of every 550 adults is currently in pretrial detention and, in recent years, the rate is growing (in contrast to sentenced imprisonment).   This study follows 245,060 felony cases in New York City to examine the impact of pretrial detention on case outcome and reoffending., Numerous studies have examined the relationship between being detained pre-trial and being convicted. The problem is that there may be unobserved or unmeasured differences between cases in which the defendant is detained and those in which they are released.  Although it is hard to argue, normally, that society benefits from the large variation across judges in decisions which result in accused people being detained or released, one advantage of this variation is that the assignment of cases to judges is typically unsystematic.  Thus whether the case is being handled by a ‘tough’ or ‘lenient’ judge is unlikely to be related to case characteristics.  If, then, cases assigned to judges who are likely to detain have different case outcomes from cases assigned to judges who are more likely to release accused people, it is likely to be the result of whether, overall, the accused was detained or released., This study looks at cases heard by 212 judges, each of whom heard at least 500 arraignment (pre-trial detention) cases between 2009 and 2013.  If a judge decides that a person can be released, cash bail is usually set, though in many cases the accused is unable to come up with the bail amount.  A case was defined as ‘detained’ if the accused was formally detained or not released because they were not able to come up with the required cash.   Case characteristics, for felony cases, were clearly unrelated to the average severity of the judge who dealt with the case.  For misdemeanour cases, there was some suggestion that certain cases were somewhat more likely to go to ‘tough’ judges.  Hence inferences about the impact of detention for misdemeanors are somewhat more problematic than inferences concerning felonies. Nevertheless, the results for the 728,750 misdemeanor cases are largely similar to those described below for the felony cases., The results for felonies demonstrate that “being detained increases the probability of conviction by 13 percentage points and the probability of pleading guilty by 10 percentage points… [suggesting] that detention primarily affects conviction by inducing some individuals who would not have pled guilty if released to plead guilty after they are detained” (p. 543).  This effect was more pronounced in felony cases in which the accused has no criminal record. Compared to those who receive pretrial release, those who are detained are also less likely to receive a reduction in the class of offence that they plead to., Obviously, those who are detained for the period before their cases are disposed of are less likely to be re-arrested before the disposition of the original case. However, these ‘benefits’ are lost when one considers the fact that those detained are, within two years of the final decision on the case, more likely to be re-arrested even though, for those who were initially detained, some of the study participants spent time in sentenced custody.   Hence, the short-term incapacitation effect of pretrial detention is largely lost by what happens within two years of the end of the case., Conclusion:  The results are clear.  Those who have the misfortune to be arraigned before a ‘tough’ judicial officer are not only more likely to be detained.  They are more likely to plead guilty, they are less likely to be offered attractive plea deals, and they are more likely, after the case is disposed of, to commit future offences.  “Tough” decisions at the pretrial detention stage then are “effective” both in getting accused to plead guilty and in increasing the likelihood of future offending., Reference: Leslie, Emily and Nolan G.

Using victimization data (rather than measures of crimes reported to the police) demonstrates that high concentrations of immigrants in a neighbourhood provide protection from crime. The data show that both economically advantaged and disadvantaged people enjoy the crime-reduction benefit of high concentrations of immigrants in their neighbourhoods.,", There is a substantial research literature (see Criminological Highlights 17(4)#1) demonstrating that when the concentration of immigrants (including ‘undocumented’ immigrants) in a neighbourhood increases crime tends to decrease.  In general, however, this research uses either homicide data or police-based measures of crime (i.e., reports of crime that are recorded by the police)., This paper examines victimization data – from US victimization surveys carried out in 2008-2012 – of residents’ reports of their own victimizations.  It examines whether the ‘protective’ impact of immigrants is concentrated on particular groups of people. Hence the paper examines the relationship between the concentration of immigrants and the non-lethal violent victimization (sexual assault, robbery, and assault) experiences of Whites, Blacks, and Latinos. The key variable of interest is the proportion of the neighbourhood population that was foreign born.  Various other predictors of victimization were also examined, including county labour market data, population density, age, family structure, and various neighbourhood measures of economic disadvantage.  Part of the reason for examining the race of those who are possible victims is that in the US, Whites tend to live in neighbourhoods with lower proportions of foreign born (9%) compared to Blacks (13%) and Latinos (26%).  Hence it is possible that Whites do not benefit from increased concentrations of foreign born., Overall, a high concentration of immigrants in a neighbourhood was associated with lower likelihood of violent crime (reported or not reported to the police). This held true even when 9 neighbourhood variables, 10 county labour and housing market variables, region, and 12 variables related to the individual respondents were controlled for., The results appear to show, however, that this protective effect is primarily experienced by those who live in neighbourhoods with high concentrations of immigrants; there is little difference in the likelihood of victimization for those living in low vs. moderate concentrations of immigrants.  Latinos who tend to live in neighbourhoods with high concentrations of immigrants experience the largest change in the protective impact of immigrants as one moves from low to moderate concentrations of immigrants., It appears that the protective impact of high concentration of immigrants was larger for Latinos than for Blacks and Whites. However, perhaps more important than these details is the finding that there is a “significant protective role of immigrant concentration on [violent] victimization for Whites, Blacks, and Latinos that is not dampened by a person’s low education level, low income, and unemployment or by measures of labour market competitions between citizens and noncitizens or between Latinos and non-Latinos” (p. 324)., Conclusion:  Consistent with a large body of research, these findings, using reports of victimizations (reported or not reported to the police) rather than police-recorded data, show that high concentrations of foreign-born people in a neighbourhood are associated with lower rates of victimization.  Given that the findings hold for all groups that were examined (Whites, Blacks, and Latinos), the findings might be “useful to encourage local communities to evaluate their attitudes toward immigration and create a more immigrant-friendly environment….” (p. 324)., Reference: Xie, Min and Eric P.

"The small increase in crime in California that immediately followed an attempt to reduce state imprisonment was not caused by the change in imprisonment policy. Instead, it seems most likely to be ordinary ‘random’ variation in crime rates.",", In November 2014, a citizen-initiated proposition (Prop 47) in California required that certain property and drug offences be charged as misdemeanors rather than felonies. The clear purpose was to reduce imprisonment.  However, in 2015, there were increases in violent crime (8.4%) and property crime (6.6%) in the state, leading some to believe that the increase in crime was caused by the reduction in the use of imprisonment., This paper examines whether the increases in crime in California can reasonably be attributed to the change in law. It separately examined the changes that took place in homicide, rape, aggravated assault, robbery, burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft rates.   At the time the study was done, post-Prop 47 data were only available for one year.   However, from a public policy perspective it is often important to examine the effects of single events quickly in order to determine whether additional legislative change is needed or warranted., The challenge, of course, is to identify a ‘counterfactual’ comparison that allows one to estimate what would have happened if the change in law had not occurred.  The problem is that simply looking at what the situation was before the policy change isn’t adequate since crime rates aren’t stable. Crime rates do not always move in a simple linear fashion. Often there are year-to-year irregularities that are best explained as random events (see Criminological Highlights 17(3)#4).  And examining some nearby jurisdiction(s) may not be adequate because the pattern of crime rates may not have been similar to that in the jurisdiction of interest.  In this study, a “synthetic control group” for California was created by weighting data from other states in a way that “fits California’s crime trends from 2010 to 2014 [the year of Prop 47]” (p. 700)., For homicide, rape, aggravated assault, robbery and burglary, there was no evidence that Prop 47 had an impact.  When compared to the “synthetic control’ which had crime trends between 1970 and 2014 that were very similar to those of California (and in many cases, like California crime rate data, changed direction frequently during this period), California and the ‘untreated control’ looked similar., For larceny and motor vehicle theft, however, initial comparisons suggested that California, in the year after Prop 47, had higher rates than would be expected.   However, even for these two offences, the data are problematic: the change in rate for motor vehicle thefts was well within the range that one would expect on the basis of random variation across states. For larceny, it would appear that the marginally significant effect was sensitive to the particular states chosen for comparison.  Hence even if one were to accept the idea that this one offence (out of 7) showed an increase after the implementation of Prop 7, the finding is both weak and needs to be interpreted with caution., Conclusion: Overall, there is no evidence that the reduction of the use of imprisonment that came into force in late 2014 had any effect on 4 violent offences.  The increases in crime that occurred in 2 of the three property offences “are both sensitive to alternative specifications [of the control group] and too small to rule out spuriousness” (p. 708).  These conclusions are based on only one year of data after the reduction in the use of imprisonment.  At a minimum, however, they suggest caution is necessary in assuming that the small increases in crime that followed the change in law had anything to do with the change in law. The paper also illustrates the importance of, and difficulty in, examining changes in crime that occur after a policy change.  One safe conclusion is that caution and care are both needed in assessing the impact of changes in punishment policy on crime., Reference: Bartos, Bradley J. and Charis E.

"The amount of experience a forensic examiner has (e.g., in assessing fingerprints or bitemarks for criminal trials) is more important to jurors in determining how much weight to give forensic evidence than whether the assessments are based on reliable scientific evidence.",", In 2009, the US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) found “many forensic sciences to be sorely lacking in scientific support and practices.”  Soon thereafter work began “testing the foundational assumptions of some forensic disciplines” (p. 401).  This paper examines the way ordinary people – potential jurors – assess forensic evidence., There appear to be at least three factors that might be relevant to the judgements that ordinary people make about whether to believe forensic science evidence.  First, has the method been scientifically tested?  The NAS found that “much forensic science evidence… is introduced in criminal trials without any meaningful scientific validation, determination of error rates, or reliability testing….” (p. 402).  Second, is the forensic expert experienced?  There is some evidence suggesting that when forensic evidence is linguistically complex, jurors rely heavily on the credentials of the expert. Third, does the technique appear to be sophisticated?  It is possible that jurors assume that technological sophistication implies validity. The last two factors (experience and apparent technical sophistication) are obviously problematic in that they are not logically related to validity., In the first of two experiments 441 volunteers on the web were randomly assigned to read one of two 700-word cases: one involving sexual assault and bitemark evidence; the other involving murder and fingerprint evidence. The forensic evidence in all cases supported the prosecution. Cases described the technique used as having been subjected to a great deal of scientific testing or no testing.   The forensic examiner was described as either having extensive experience or having worked on only a handful of cases.  Finally, the technique that was used was described as being ordinary photographic techniques or as using high-tech ultraviolet photographic equipment. Participants read one of the 16 different descriptions of the case and were asked about the strength of the evidence and the guilt of the accused., For both cases (the sexual assault/bitemark case and the murder/fingerprint case) the evidence was seen as being stronger when it was described as coming from a validated source and an experienced examiner.  Sophisticated technology increased the perceived strength of the case in the bitemark case.  However, neither the scientific validity of the technique that was used nor the technical sophistication of the technique affected the perception of guilt of the accused. On the bitemark case, however, those who heard that the examiner had lots of experience were more likely to see the accused as guilty (the result consistent with the examiner’s conclusion)., In the second experiment, only one case was used (involving fingerprints). Ordinary citizens, in groups of 6-8, saw a video of a ‘trial’.  They gave pre-deliberation views of the validity of the evidence and the guilt of the accused.  They then deliberated and gave (individual) verdicts again. The consistent finding was that jurors, in their evaluation of the validity of the technique, were affected by the apparent experience of the examiner not the evidence that the technique that was used was scientifically valid or sophisticated., Conclusion: Contrary to scientific norms, the demonstrated validity of the forensic technique appeared to be unimportant to jurors in these jury simulation experiments.  It would appear that they relied, instead, on the amount of experience the examiner had.  In other words, jurors use the background and experience of the examiner as a proxy for the value of the evidence.  The problem with this is simple: an examiner’s impressive background is more important for jurors when evaluating forensic evidence than the demonstrated validity of the evidence itself., Reference: Koehler, J.J., N.J.

Restorative justice conferencing may not be appropriate for young offenders.,", There is a growing amount of research suggesting that formal contact with the youth justice system can have negative effects on youths (Criminological Highlights [CH] 16(4)#5, 14(6)#1, 11(4)#3, 17(4)#8).  These negative effects are, perhaps, most obvious in the case of incarceration of youths (CH 17(3)#3, 11(4)#3, 12(5)#7, 12(1)#8, 10(6)#1)., The negative effects have led some people to advocate for approaches involving restorative justice conferences (RJC) for youths notwithstanding the research suggesting the importance of careful matching of youths to programs (CH 17(3)#6) if one is interested in reducing reoffending or improving the lives of youths., Restorative justice programs, however, have their own issues (CH 6(6)#2, 5(3)#1), among them being that they are often used with youths who have committed relatively minor offences (CH 7(3)#8) and who may not benefit from them. Though some scholars have noted that these programs can be justified on broader dimensions than just their effects on recidivism (CH 9(5)#1), the effect of RJCs on participants are somewhat inconsistent (CH 6(6)#2,  10(1)#6), 16(1)#7)., This paper examines RJCs for youths in the context of research on the developmental and cognitive capacities of youth and suggests that restorative processes may not be ideally suited for youths.  The problem is straightforward: young people may not have the cognitive capacity to be appropriate participants in RJCs. The use of RJCs with youths may be more acceptable to the general public than RJCs with adults but this, alone, does not justify their use with youths., More important is the suggestion that “RJC is seen as encouraging youth offenders to develop empathy and moral reasoning, make amends to victims, and [as a result] successfully reintegrate into their communities” (p. 452-3). This raises an important question: are youths mature enough to adequately experience two emotions – empathy and shame – that are often seen as important components of RJC?  Not surprisingly, some accounts of RJC suggest that young offenders often drift “from apologetic discourse to mitigating accounts and back again” (p. 457).  The research on the not-fully-developed cognitive processes of youths is consistent with the findings of a systematic review of high quality research on RJC suggested that, if anything, RJCs may be more effective with adults than youth and, perhaps, more effective with respect to serious offences and with those who had already gone through the court process rather than participating in RJCs instead of court (CH 15(4)#4)., Conclusion:  Restorative justice conferences (RJCs) are often seen as an effective alternative to formal youth justice processing as if these were the only two possible approaches to responding to offending by youths.  This paper suggests that just because RJCs may be more acceptable to the public as alternatives to normal criminal justice processing for youths than adults does not mean that they are effective or appropriate  for youths.  In addition, the manner in which RJCs are implemented, and the selection of participants vary so much across programs that it is risky to conclude that a given program is going to be effective unless its selection and operational approaches follow well-researched effective programs. At a minimum, however, given the specific concerns about the appropriateness of RJCs with youths it is important “to identify what specific skills or abilities youth offenders lack, such as verbal ability, and address these issues…” (p. 461)., Reference:  Suzuki, Masahiro and William R.

Accused people who appear in court in enclosed “prisoners’ docks” are more likely to be convicted (in realistic jury simulation experiments) than if they were sitting next to their lawyers in the body of the court.,", Secure prisoners’ docks, where the accused is fully enclosed in a secure cage, are becoming more common in many jurisdictions.  The alternative – which is common in most Australian states in situations in which an accused is not in custody – is that those on trial are seated with their lawyers or are seated immediately behind their lawyers., The problem with prisoners’ docks, as with accused people showing up in court in prison clothing, is that this “could be seen as a ‘brand of incarceration’ [that] could undermine the presumption of innocence” (p. 323) or could lead to the inference that the accused person is dangerous.   This study used a trial court in Sydney Australia in which a trial, loosely based on a terrorist conspiracy case, was re-enacted before 404 research participants recruited from the jury-eligible list for the city.   This trial was re-enacted 9 times by actors under three conditions.  For approximately one-third of the participants, the accused was sitting at the same table as his lawyer.  For another third of the participants, the accused was at an open dock, and for the third group of participants, the accused was in a glass enclosed dock.  Each condition was presented 3 times.  Ordinary instructions from the judge on ‘reasonable doubt’ were given as were instructions concerning the elements of the offence that needed to be proved., The participants were assigned unsystematically to one of the three groups (accused sitting with his lawyer, in an open dock, or in a glass-enclosed prisoners’ dock). To address pre-existing differences in participants’ punitiveness, their ‘punitiveness’ was assessed two weeks before participating in the study and the scale value for ‘punitiveness’ was included as a factor in the analyses.  This also allowed the researchers to see if the location of the accused in the court had an effect both for highly punitive and less punitive jurors., Overall, 36% of the jurors who watched the (simulated) trial with the accused sitting with the lawyer thought he was guilty.   47% of those who saw the accused sitting in an open or glass-enclosed dock thought he was guilty. This relationship held both for those who were high and those who were low on the ‘punitiveness’ scale, though in all conditions those high in punitiveness were more likely than those low on this scale to find the accused guilty., The research participants were also asked to indicate how strong they found the evidence. Not surprisingly, across all conditions, those who found the evidence weak almost never thought that the accused was guilty.  Similarly, those who saw the evidence as strong – across all conditions – were likely to find the accused guilty.  It was for those in the middle – who saw the evidence as moderately strong – that the placement of the accused mattered.  For this group, only 28% of those who saw the accused sitting with his lawyer would have found him guilty.  This increased to 50% for those who saw the accused in either an open or glass-enclosed dock., Conclusion: “Being in the [open or glass-enclosed] dock increases the chances that a defendant will be found guilty [in comparison to the situation where the accused is sitting with his lawyer]” (p. 340).  In particular, “jurors whose assessment of the evidence strength is neither very strong nor very weak may turn to other cues (such as whether the accused is in a dock) to assist their decision” (p. 340)., Reference: Rossner, Meredith, David Tait, Blake McKimmie, and Rick Sarre (2017).

Criminal sanctions for Black and White defendants are harsher for those with darker skin tones.,"Race has been shown to be an important determinant of the severity of treatment within the criminal justice system in the US and elsewhere. There also is evidence that light-skinned African-Americans fare better in U.S. society than do those with darker skin tones.  This study examines whether the disadvantages of having a darker skin tone and Afrocentric facial features carry into the criminal justice system for Black, as well as White, defendants., One of the challenges in studies like this is to determine what the punishment ‘should have been’ independent of extra-legal characteristics such as skin tone.  In this study, the problem was overcome by using data from Minnesota, a state with sentencing guidelines, in which the presumptive sentence is determined explicitly by a guideline that is a function of the offence and the criminal record., The researchers obtained ‘booking photographs’ of males charged in 2009 from the police in the Twin Cities, Minnesota.  These were linked to the sentencing information for 264 offenders coded as white in the state guideline commission files and 602 offenders coded as black. The incarceration decisions for these 866 offenders resulted in three outcomes: incarceration imposed and executed, incarceration imposed but stayed, incarceration stayed (no imprisonment)., The researchers had each of the police booking photographs rated by four people (2 of each sex; 2 Blacks, 1 White, and 1 Hispanic).  They rated skin tone (7-point scale, very light to very dark).  They also rated (on three separate dimensions) how “Afrocentric” the face was.  These three dimensions of Afrocentric characteristics were combined into one index.  The indexes had high inter-rater reliability., Without controls, those offenders described as Black in the official files were more likely to go directly to prison and less likely to receive a stay of the imposition of a prison sentence.  However, once various controls were introduced, this measure of race no longer had a statistically significant effect on incarceration decisions.  Said differently, once the presumptive sentence under the Minnesota guidelines, criminal history, whether the accused went to trial and type of offence (drug, violent) were accounted for, race was not significant., Using the same set of controls, the effect of skin tone was examined.  Those rated as ‘dark’ and those with ‘Afrocentric features’ were significantly more likely to be imprisoned and less likely to receive a stay (no imprisonment).  Looking only at the 602 offenders officially described as Black, those with dark skin tones were more likely to be unconditionally imprisoned than those with lighter skin tones. There was, however, no impact of Afrocentric features for these 602 offenders.  For the 264 White offenders, those with darker skin tones and those with Afrocentric features were more likely to be imprisoned., Conclusion: This research suggests that much of the black-white disparity in the imposition of prison sentences is attributable to the manner in which dark-skinned blacks are treated. Dark-skinned blacks were especially likely to receive unconditional prison sentences even when legal factors were controlled.  “The most novel finding [was that] overall, whites with features that are more typically associated with blacks – darker skin tone and more Afrocentric facial features – are treated more punitively” (p. 115)., Reference: King, Ryan D., and Brian D.

People with records of contact with the criminal justice system find that persuading others – potential employers or landlords – to overlook their records is just about impossible. They clearly realize that some form of state expungement of the record is necessary for them to have a chance at full reintegration into society.,", In pre-internet days, criminal records could effectively be made to disappear because there was no easy way for ordinary people to find out whether someone had a criminal record.  Today, “the visibility of the criminal record history makes it difficult for record-bearers to avoid negative repercussions: background checks have become commonplace” (p. 388)., In addition, in many jurisdictions, criminal records do not necessarily involve just criminal convictions. Simply being arrested at some point, even if no conviction results from the arrest, can become part of one’s criminal record and, in turn, affect one’s life chances. Well-paying jobs where minor records are irrelevant (e.g., in manufacturing) are fewer in number.  Various licensed trades and professions, as well as the education programs required for occupational or professional certification, often require ‘clean’ records.  In addition, rules requiring ‘clean records’ are often made by national head offices of corporations, which may mean it is impossible for local exceptions to be made. “Criminal justice records are more plentiful, accessible, and persistent than they have been…” (p. 390).   Many jurisdictions allow some form of expungement or sealing of criminal records (see, Criminological Highlights 15(2)#6). Illinois, where this study was carried out, allowed expungement of records of most offences, often after a designated waiting period., In this study, people applying to have their records expunged were interviewed to find out how they had been affected by a criminal record. The most obvious disadvantage they mentioned was in obtaining or maintaining employment.  For example, one 30 year-old woman, arrested at age 21 for the misdemeanour offence of “reckless conduct –  the result of a loud argument with her cousin” (p.399)– found that her undergraduate degree in early childhood and family services and her verifiable work history were irrelevant for getting a job: She was explicitly told that her one arrest labelled her forever. Another man, who had been free of any problems for 12 years, was told by Walmart that they wouldn’t hire him even if his last contact with the justice system had been 102 years before.  McDonalds took the same position. Another man was conditionally accepted for a job and then had the offer revoked because of a 14-year old misdemeanor charge that was ultimately dismissed. Such decisions were non-negotiable., Conclusion: The common themes of those who were trying to get their records expunged were “frustration with blocked opportunity…; an inability to use personal contact to change employers’ beliefs about the meaning and relevance of the criminal record history; and frustration with the ongoing and punitive nature of the criminal justice system.  These themes were present for participants with both extensive and minor criminal justice histories” (p. 405).   Given that after a period of time, a criminal record no longer predicts offending (Criminological Highlights 8(4)#4, 10(5)#6), these findings suggest a disproportionately punitive response to criminal justice contact. In past decades, “By not disclosing their past criminal justice contact, and upholding conventional lifestyles, ex-offenders could easily circumvent potential stigma” (p. 407). This no longer is the case.  For jurisdictions truly interested in promoting reintegration of those who have come in contact with the criminal justice system, this would seem to be a useful area for reform., Reference: Ispa-Landa, Simone and Charles E.

Neighbourhoods with large concentrations of registered sex offenders living in them are not more likely to experience high rates of sex offences once the overall violent (non-sex) crime rate is taken into account.,", Over the past few decades, those convicted of sex offences have had various restrictions placed on them based largely on two false assumptions: “Once a sex offender, always a sex offender” and the notion that sex offenders will offend against strangers near where they live.  These assumptions have been challenged by a substantial amount of empirical evidence (see, for example, our collection on sex offending)., Restrictions on where those convicted of sex offences can live seem to assume that sex crime victimization will take place near the home of a person who was once convicted of a sex crime. Given that so many sex offences – with adult and child victims – involve offenders already known to the victim, it seems plausible to hypothesize that the concentration of sex offenders in a neighbourhood is not an important contributor to victimization by strangers in the community., This study examined sex offending in Indianapolis, Indiana.  The parts of the city in which people lived and for which reliable data were obtained were divided into 2049 grid cells, 1000 feet on each side.   The number of registered sex offenders believed to be living in each grid cell or within 1000, 1500, or 2500 feet from the centre of the grid cell was calculated.  Measures of the dependent variable included rape, total sex offences, and sex offences against minors., In general, the most simple analysis – without any controls – showed that the higher the number of sex offenders in a ‘cell’, the higher the number of sex crimes.  However, an equally simple analysis demonstrated that the number of sex offences taking place in a grid cell was strongly related to the number of violent offences that occurred in that neighbourhood.  Controls for the normal determinants of crime, therefore, are important since registered sex offenders – in part because of restrictions on them – cannot choose to live anywhere., More sophisticated analyses controlled for neighbourhood disadvantage (e.g., percent living in poverty, percent unemployed), the racial composition of the neighbourhood, and the length of major roads in the cell (on the assumption that a substantial amount of through traffic could increase crime), and, most importantly, the level of violent non-sex crime in the neighbourhood.  When those controls were introduced, there was no longer any indication that having a high number of registered sex offenders in the cell was related to the number of rapes, the total number of sex offences, and the number of sex offences against minors.  Various additional analyses – using two different statistical techniques and looking at the number of sex offenders within 1000, 1500 and 2000 feet of the centre of the cell — showed no consistent pattern., Conclusion: The number of sex offenders living in or near a particular location in the city was not a useful predictor of sex offending once other factors were controlled.  However, the data imply that registered sex offenders do tend to live in relatively high crime areas.  Hence, it is understandable that people might assume that a high concentration of registered sex offenders puts nearby residents at special risk.  Nevertheless, this study found no consistent relationship between the concentration of sex offenders and the rate of sex crimes in a neighbourhood after controlling for the fact that registered sex offenders live in high crime areas., Reference:  Stucky, Thomas D. and John R.

"Black high school students in Toronto are more likely to be stopped and searched by the police than non-Black students. However, there do not appear to be differences between Black and White youths living on the street in the rate of being stopped and searched.",", There is a substantial amount of evidence from many jurisdictions that Blacks are more likely to be stopped and searched by the police even when various relevant controls are taken into account. This paper replicates these findings using a survey of 3,393 high school students carried out in 2000 along with data from 396 ‘street youths’ recruited in three shelters and four drop-in centres that provide services for Toronto’s homeless., Students from 5 randomly chosen homeroom classes in each of 30 randomly chosen Toronto high schools (public and Catholic) were sampled.  Most (82%) of the youths who were asked to participate in the survey completed it. Street youths, defined as those between ages 14 and 24 who were living either on the street or in a shelter, were interviewed (face-to-face) to ensure that those who might have difficulty reading a survey would be able to answer the questions., Most (86%) street youths reported being stopped at least once in the previous 2 years, compared to ‘only’ 39% of the high school students.  74% of the street youth had been searched at least once during this same period, compared to 18% of the high school students.  Black high school students were considerably more likely to be stopped at least once than were white high school students (63% vs. 41%).  30% of high school youths of other races reported being stopped at least once.  Other variables also predicted stops and/or searches including social class, the level of engagement in public activities on the street, involvement in partying, frequency of driving, involvement in illegal activities, and membership in gangs.  However, while these factors independently predicted stops and searches, being Black had an impact above and beyond these factors for the high school students., Youths who reported higher levels of involvement in illegal behaviour were more likely to be stopped by the police than youths with lower levels of involvement. For those highly involved in illegal activities, there was no difference between Blacks and Whites in the likelihood of being stopped by the police: Multiple stops were reported by 86% of the Black youths and a statistically indistinguishable 80% of the White youths.   At the other end of the spectrum, however, for youths who reported no involvement in illegal activities, 4% of the White youths and 27% of the Black youths reported multiple police stops.  It seems that “good behaviour does not protect Black youth from police contact to the same extent that it protects white youth” (p. 340)., Among the street youths, however, race did not predict stops or searches.  66% of the street youths met the criteria for being ‘highly involved in illegal activities.’ It would seem that “high criminality exposes people of all races to equal levels of police scrutiny” (p. 341).  Hence, street youths, as a group, had a very high likelihood of being stopped and searched no matter what their race., Conclusion:  “For high school students… race attracts police attention.  Among youth who engage in roughly similar types of behaviour, and similar levels of delinquency, black youth are stopped and searched more often than white youth” (p. 342).  For street youths, who by definition are seen as being deviant, race becomes less important.  For these youths, multiple stops and searches are part of normal existence, independent of race., Reference:  Hayle, Steven, Scot Wortley, and Julian Tanner (2016).

"Stopping crime by imposing curfews on youths seems like an easy way to reduce crime and victimization.  There’s one problem, however:  curfews don’t work.",", Searching for quick fixes to complex crime problems is popular in many locations.  The Washington Post once suggested that while a curfew does not constitute “a miraculous cure-all to juvenile crime, it is merely a common-sense approach that police believe would be a useful tool in protecting public safety” (p. 168)., The theory of the effectiveness of curfews is simple: reduced opportunity for youths should translate into fewer crimes. This ignores, among other things, data suggesting that most crime by youths takes place in the hours immediately before and immediately after school., Not surprisingly, the data do not support the effectiveness of curfews (see Criminological Highlights, 3(2)#2, 3(4)#7).  This paper examined all those studies with relatively adequate research designs that focused on either juvenile offending or victimization and used either official measures of crime or self-report measures of offending. Ten unique studies – all carried out in the US and published between 1999 and 2012 – were located.  Various research designs were used.  “Curfews are often implemented in response to a spike in crime or due to a particularly newsworthy event” (p. 177) which is a problem because spikes in crime typically revert back to average rates, even if legislative bodies don’t act.  In four of the 10 studies the origin of the curfew law was some unusual event that may have been associated with a temporary increase in crime that would, without any intervention, typically return to normal levels. Hence the advantage of having some form of comparison group.  More problematic is that curfews often come into effect along with other changes (e.g., other programs for youth) making it very difficult, if crime were to decline, to know what might be the cause., Because the ten studies evaluated the curfew laws on different dimensions, the results are reported for those different dimensions.  The two studies that looked at juvenile crime during curfew hours each showed a non-significant increase in crime. Eight studies looked at juvenile arrests for crime during all hours.  Five studies showed small increases, one no change, and two showed decreases.  Overall, there was almost no change in juvenile crime or arrests associated with curfews.  Juvenile victimization was examined in two studies: one reported a small decrease, the other an increase., The nature of the intervention – a change in the law affecting when youth can be unsupervised in the community – obviously does not easily lend itself to randomization as a technique of testing the impact of intervention.  Most studies looked at variants on an interrupted time-series design.  All but two of the studies used time series that were too short to adequately disentangle an effect of the curfew – had there been one – from a long term trend over time.  Given that most of these studies were carried out when crime was generally decreasing in most parts of the US, it would not have been surprising to see strong decreases in crime attributed to curfews., Conclusion: “The evidence across the ten studies… suggests that a curfew reduces neither juvenile criminal behaviour nor victimization… [The] finding of no effect may mean that juvenile curfews truly have no impact on crime, or that any impact they have is too small to be reliably detected….  The lack of any credible evidence in their favour suggests that any effect is likely to be small at best, and that curfews are unlikely to be a meaningful solution to juvenile crime and disorder” (p. 183)., Reference: Wilson, David B., Ajima Olaghere, and Charlotte Gill (2016).

"Intensive searches of people going through security at airports are viewed as constituting hostile treatment by those being searched, but this effect can be mitigated, to some extent, if searches are carried out in a procedurally fair way that demonstrates concern about passengers’ experiences.",", A substantial amount of evidence suggests that being treated in a manner that is perceived as fair leads people to be more cooperative with police and other authorities.  For example, the willingness of members of the Muslim community in New York to cooperate voluntarily with the police in combating terrorism is determined, in part, by how Muslims are treated by the police and others in the community (Criminological Highlights 11(4)#1)., This paper suggests that procedural fairness is also important in ordinary situations in which people are subjected to coercive power: airport security checks.  The study was carried out in Israel’s Ben-Gurion airport where those perceived to be of higher risk are subjected to levels of questioning and searches not required of others. The researchers interviewed air passengers immediately after they had passed through security.  The goal was to understand whether and, if so, why the extra security procedures led to hostile feelings on the part of the passenger subjected to them.  Feelings of hostility were measured with questions such as “I felt threatened by the security screening process” and “Security officers at Ben-Gurion airport show indifference to the passenger’s experience.”, Procedural justice was measured with 6 questions including “The security officers treated me with politeness and dignity” and “The security officers treated me like every other passenger”., Not surprisingly, “extra” surveillance was imposed more frequently on foreign and Israeli-Arab passengers, and on males, those who weren’t married, those travelling alone, and more religious passengers.  These and other factors were ‘controlled’ for in the analysis of the impact of extra security procedures on overall hostility toward the security checks., Two of the four extra security checks (searches of suitcases and taking the passenger to a different part of the airport for security procedures) led to increased hostility even when procedural justice was included in the prediction model.  However, above and beyond demographic measures (such as whether the passenger was a foreign person or an Israeli Arab), being treated in a respectful and neutral way by the security officers reduced overall feelings of hostility toward the security process., Conclusion: It would seem that using high levels of procedural justice in interactions with passengers in an airport security setting can have an effect on passengers’ feelings of hostility toward the process. However, being treated in a procedurally fair manner cannot eliminate the impact of the most intrusive kinds of questioning and searches.  Hence “procedural justice, at least as commonly defined and operationalized today, does not fully account for individuals’ evaluation of the process, and other factors, such as the nature of the policing practice being used, should be considered” (p. 631-2)., Reference: Jonathan-Zemir, Tal, Badi Hasisi, and Yoram Margalioth (2016).  Is It the What or the How?  The Roles of High Policing Tactics and Procedural Justice in Predicting Perceptions of Hostile Treatment: The Case of Security Checks at Ben-Gurion Airport, Israel.  Law & Society Review, 50(3), 608-636., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV16N3.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-16-no-3-%E2%80%93-january-2017,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 16, No. 3 – January 2017",Regular Issue,2017
Young Black Americans’ perceptions of criminal injustice depends on more than the nature of their own interactions with justice authorities.,", Black Americans are more likely than others to perceive that they are treated in an unfair manner. But in addition, Black Americans living in disadvantaged neighbourhoods are especially more likely than others to have negative views of the justice system. A question raised by this paper is whether it is structural disadvantage per se that is important in understanding these neighbourhood and race differences or whether it is the moral and legal cynicism of the neighbourhood that is important in understanding perceptions of criminal injustice., Over a period of 11 years, 689 African American youths (age 10-12 years old at the beginning of the study) and their families were interviewed 5 times.  They were recruited from 39 neighbourhoods in two states.  These neighbourhoods varied considerably at the beginning of the study in their degree of ‘structural disadvantage’ (e.g., proportion of families on public assistance, proportion unemployed).  Moral and legal cynicism was measured for the neighbourhood when the youth was 19-21 years old by combining responses from those in the neighbourhood to 10 items such as  “How important is it to obey the law?”, “Behaving aggressively is often an effective way of dealing with someone who is taking advantage of you”,  or how ‘wrong’ it is to commit certain crimes such as stealing something, selling drugs.  During these interviews, the parent and the youth were each asked if they had been treated unjustly or in a discriminatory manner by the police in the year before the interview., When youths were 21-23 years old, their own perceptions of criminal injustice were assessed by asking them to indicate their degree of agreement/disagreement with statements such as “Police are more likely to stop and question Blacks unfairly than those in other racial groups”; “Courts are biased and unfair when it comes to deciding cases with Black suspects and White victims”; “Courts punish Blacks more harshly than Whites.”  Various control variables (e.g., sex, various measures of criminal justice involvement by the youth) were also included., Structural disadvantage of the neighbourhood only predicted perceptions of criminal injustice when neighbourhood moral and legal cynicism were not included in the prediction model.   Moral and legal cynicism did, however, predict perceptions of injustice. “It is not simply structural disadvantage that generates perceptions of injustice among African Americans. Rather disadvantage promotes collective cynicism [in the neighbourhood], which is associated with appraisals of biases in the criminal justice system” (p. 535).  Both personal and vicarious (parental) negative interactions with the police were also associated with increased perceptions of injustice.  In addition, “individuals who [directly or vicariously] experienced negative encounters [with the police] and also reside in neighbourhoods characterized by high levels of moral and legal cynicism are [especially] likely to view the criminal justice system as being biased against them” (p. 536)., Conclusion: “For the state to secure voluntary compliance from the public, it is necessary for it to be perceived as morally credible” (p. 520).  This paper suggests that the legitimacy of the state in the eyes of young Black Americans is undermined most dramatically when negative interactions with the police occur to those who live in neighbourhoods that can be characterized as already having high degrees of legal cynicism. These results are independent of individuals’ record of offending, arrests or other criminal justice contact., Reference: Berg, Mark T., Eric A. Stewart, Jonathan Intravia, Patricia Y.

The substantial decarceration that took place in New York City (NYC) between 1996 and 2014 demonstrates that important changes in the manner in which the law is administered can be made at the ground level.  Not all reform has to come from above.,", Many jurisdictions struggle to control or reduce the number of people who are incarcerated. NYC in the past couple of decades has benefitted from both a reduction in crime and a reduction in imprisonment.   Though, in the past, increased imprisonment might have been seen by some as the easiest way to reduce crime, what is notable during this period is that both crime and imprisonment decreased dramatically in NYC., Other decarcerations (see Criminological Highlights 3(5)#1, 12(1)#5,  14(3)#6) have occurred because two factors came together: There was a desire to reduce the rate of imprisonment and a willingness to implement a series of changes to accomplish that goal. Often administrative changes were just as important, or more important, than legislative changes. NYC’s recent decarceration is an example of changes originating from the bottom – in this case, the municipality – rather than from the top (the nation’s capital).  NYC was solely responsible for a 28% reduction in the state’s total prison population.  Between 1997 and 2015, the number of prisoners in NY’s state prisons who were sentenced in NYC declined from about 48,000 to 23,000, whereas the number of prisoners from the rest of the state increased from about 22,000 to 29,000., The increase in NYC’s imprisonment prior to 1997 was driven, in large part, by drugs.  Starting in the late 1990s, the number of felony drug arrests dropped dramatically from about 46,000 to about 16,000.  Starting in 2011, misdemeanor drug arrests (often for marijuana) also declined, by about half.  In addition, a smaller proportion of felony drug cases that resulted in a finding of guilt ended up with a prison sentence.  Drug admissions to state prison declined from 44% of all admissions in 2000 to 23% in 2013. Sentence lengths for drug offenders also declined.  In 1996, 34% of prisoners in NY had a drug conviction; in 2014 it was 12%.   By 2014, state authorities had closed 13 prison facilities., NYC’s jail population (those with short sentences or in pretrial detention) decreased from 21,688 in 1991 to 9,762 in 2016, largely as a result of fewer admissions.  Average length of stay in jail, however, did not decrease.   Although felony arrests dropped dramatically between 1997 and 2014, misdemeanour arrests in NYC increased dramatically between 2002 and 2010, before beginning to drop.  Fewer people were sentenced to probation and they tended to be discharged from probation earlier, meaning there were fewer who could be incarcerated for failing to comply with probation orders. All of these changes were, no doubt, made politically easier by the fact that crime – most notably violent crime — decreased dramatically between 1991 and the 2000s in NYC., Conclusion:  NYC’s dramatic decarceration demonstrates that, in principle, large reductions in imprisonment rates can occur.  Most of the reduction occurred by moving relatively low risk people (e.g., those involved in less serious drug offences) out of the justice system or out of its prisons and jails.  Unfortunately, there have been few evaluations of the impact of the changes in policies and programs on crime.  The fact that the decarceration took place in NYC rather than in the state as a whole suggests that the local support in NYC was sufficient, without formal legislative change, to accomplish these goals., Reference: Greene, Judith A., and Vincent Schiraldi (2016).  Better by Half: The New York City Story of Winning Large-Scale Decarceration While Improving Public Safety. Federal Sentencing Reporter, 29(1), 22-38., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV16N3.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-16-no-3-%E2%80%93-january-2017,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 16, No. 3 – January 2017",Regular Issue,2017
Girls in Canada’s youth courts are much more likely than boys to have broad treatment conditions imposed on them as a condition of pretrial release.,"Although there has been a substantial decline in the rate that youths are brought to youth courts in Canada, the rate for one offence – failure to comply with a court order (typically the charge of failing to comply with a condition of pretrial release imposed in bail court) — has not shown a similar decline.  Currently these charges are the most serious charge in 17% of youth court cases., To some extent, the cohrts themselves are responsible for this large number of ‘status offences’ in Canadian youth courts: previous research (Criminological Highlights 12(5)#3, 13(1)#1, 13(5)#5, 15(3)#1) has demonstrated that imposing large numbers of conditions – many of which have little relationship to the offence – on youths who are released, especially when combined with long waits until their cases are disposed of,  increases the likelihood of youths failing to comply with their bail conditions., This paper looks carefully at the bail conditions imposed on boys and girls in one of Canada’s largest youth courts.  Although the Youth Criminal Justice Act states that youths cannot be detained in custody as a substitute for social welfare purposes (s. 29(1)), there is nothing in the Act that explicitly prohibits courts from imposing treatment or welfare-based bail release conditions.  Although higher courts have decided that it is not sufficient simply to impose conditions on a youth just because someone in the courtroom at the time the decision is made thinks it might be a good idea, it would appear that there are few restrictions on conditions imposed on youths., This paper looks at whether or not treatment orders were included in the bail conditions imposed on a random sample of youths – 425 boys and 75 girls – who were released by a Toronto court between 2009 and 2013. Girls were significantly more likely, overall,  to have treatment orders imposed on them (70% of girls and 45% of boys received treatment conditions). Typically if a youth received a treatment order it was rather broadly defined.  For example, it might require a youth to be assessed by a doctor or to “follow a doctor’s orders” or to attend a program such as counselling, anger management, or substance abuse.  Usually the conditions included both attending a treatment program and “being amenable” to treatment., For boys, treatment orders were significantly more likely to be imposed if the most serious offence involved violence, if the youth was facing more than one charge and if the youth had a previous charge.   Girls, for each category of each of these variables (e.g., cases involving violence and cases without violence), were more likely to receive treatment orders than boys.  More importantly, however, none of these three variables was significantly related to whether a girl received a treatment order., Conclusion: Simply being a girl, it would seem, was sufficient for the court to require a treatment order in 70% of the cases, quite independent of the number and nature of current charges and whether or not there had been previous charges. Boys not only were less likely than girls to receive treatment orders, but the likelihood of receiving a treatment order for boys appeared to relate to features of the case.  Since youths when they appear in bail court have not been assessed to see if there is a need for treatment and they have obviously not been convicted of anything, it is curious that girls in bail court appear to the court almost automatically to ‘need’ treatment.  “Are we observing anachronistic vestiges of the view that females in conflict with the law must be either ‘mad’ or ‘bad’?” (p. 94), Reference: Sprott, Jane B. and Allan Manson (2017) YCJA Bail Conditions: “Treating” Girls and Boys Differently.  Canadian Criminal Law Review, 22, 77-94., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV16N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-16-no-4-%E2%80%93-april-2017,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 16, No. 4 – April 2017",Regular Issue,2017
Ordinary people are better at determining whether female witnesses are telling the truth when the women are wearing a hijab or niqab than when they are wearing no form of face or head covering.,", The wearing of a niqab (a veil that covers a wearer’s face except for her eyes) is contentious in many communities.   In court, such face coverings are seen as problematic because of the belief that the trier of fact – a judge or a jury – must see the witness’s face in order to determine whether she is telling the truth., Determining whether such beliefs have merit starts with the simple fact that people, in general, are not very good at telling whether what a stranger says is true.  But in addition, “A meta-analysis of 50 studies revealed that overall lie detection accuracy was similar, whether observers received audio (i.e., more restricted) or audiovisual (i.e., less restricted) information” (p. 402)., In this paper, two studies, using the same basic design and materials, were carried out first with Canadian university students (Experiment 1), and then with university students from Canada, the Netherlands (using only those with relatively good English language skills) and the UK.   Female students observed a video of woman who had been asked to watch a stranger’s bag.  Half of the students saw a video in which the woman stole something from the bag; half saw a video in which the woman did not steal anything.  The students were then told to imagine that they were called as a witness for the accused – to state that they did not see her steal anything.  Hence half were asked to lie; half were told to tell the truth.   They were then randomly assigned to wear a black niqab, a black hijab or to remain unveiled.  A black shawl was used to cover their clothing.  A trained research assistant arranged the veils and shawls.   Each “witness” was then examined and cross examined.  From these videos, sets of 20 clips – 10 with the witness telling the truth and 10 with her lying (in random orders) – were created for each of the three veiling conditions (niqab, hijab, no veil)., Male and female students were then shown one set of video clips and were asked to indicate whether, in each clip, the witness was telling the truth.  Note that a response bias – toward saying that the witness was lying or telling the truth – could not increase or decrease accuracy., The results from the two experiments were very similar across countries.  “Contrary to the assumptions underlying [some court decisions suggesting that being able to see the face is important for determining veracity], lie detection was not hampered by veiling.  In fact, observers were more accurate at detecting deception in witnesses who wore niqabs or hijabs than those who did not veil.  Discrimination between lie- and truth-tellers was no better than guessing in the latter group…. It was only when witnesses wore veils (i.e., hijabs or niqabs) that observers performed above chance levels” (p 407)., Conclusion:  In this study, then, wearing a veil actually improved lie detection.  It would appear likely that when the witness they were observing was wearing a veil – either a niqab or a hijab – those charged with the responsibility of determining if the witness was telling the truth focused on the actual statements coming from the person they were observing.  “Seeing a person’s entire face does not appear to be necessary for lie detection; banning the niqab because it interferes with one’s ability to determine whether the speaker is lying or telling the truth is not supported by scientific evidence” (p. 408)., Reference: Leach, Amy-May, Nawal Anmar, D.

"Australia, like some other countries, has experienced a large increase in imprisonment rates in the past 30 years.  There appear to be significant costs of the increased rates of imprisonment and few benefits.  It may, however, be possible to reverse the trend.",", Between 1918 and 1984, the (national) Australian imprisonment rate averaged about 60 per 100,000 population, varying between about 45 and 81.  After 1984, however, it increased almost every year to a high of about 142 per 100,000 in 2013.  The increase occurred in each state and in the Northern Territory, though there were differences across states (see Criminological Highlights, 15(4)#5).  The increase “has been particularly marked in the case of Indigenous Australians and women” (p. 138)., Prison was used more sparingly before 1984.  For example, in 1980, 29% of those convicted of break-and-enter and theft were imprisoned; in 2015, 50% received a sentence of imprisonment.  Prior to 1984, there was a presumption of bail for most offences.  There was, as well, in at least one state, a presumption in favour of release on parole.  But during the 1970s and 1980s, crime was increasing; and punitive policies quickly followed (e.g., mandatory minimums, increased maximum penalties and reduced opportunities for release).  But since 2000, crime in Australia has decreased.  Imprisonment rates – and policies supporting high rates – have not.   The bulk of the reduction in crime is exceedingly unlikely to have been caused by the increased imprisonment since the most optimistic ‘incapacitation’ estimates would suggest that imprisonment could not account for more than 10% of the reduction in crime that Australia experienced., Data from Australia mirror what is known in Canada for youths (Criminological Highlights, 4(4)#3): “Courts are much more likely to send a person to prison if he or she has already been imprisoned, even after adjusting for other factors that influence the risk of a prison sentence” (p. 145).  Hence, to some extent, imprisonment leads to more imprisonment (at least among repeat offenders)., A number of suggestions have been made for addressing the challenge of “imprisonment growth in an era of decreasing crime”.  A focus on increased “offender rehabilitation” programs seems unlikely to affect anything since few prisoners, now, receive any program known to have favourable effects.  Reducing or abolishing the use of short sentences would reduce prison admissions dramatically, but would have less impact on prisoner counts.  Finding alternatives to imprisonment for non-criminal breaches of restrictions placed on those being punished in the community would be helpful, just as would finding alternatives to prosecution for minor offences.  Australia, like Canada and some other countries, also has a problem of a large pretrial detention population. Addressing this could have a dramatic impact on the size of the prison population.  Finally, it is suggested that “toning down the political rhetoric on law and order” might “offer Australians a more rational, more considered approach to law and order [that would allow the spending of monetary savings] on things they really want” (p. 148-9)., Conclusion:  The growth of imprisonment in Australia is not caused by crime, but rather by the beliefs and values of those making decisions about how to punish those who have offended.  Reducing the use of imprisonment to levels that served Australians well for decades, therefore, is not going to be the result of finding a single solution.  Rather it will probably involve multiple approaches and a change in the views about how best to respond to crime., Reference: Weatherburn, Don (2016). “Rack ‘em, Pack ‘em and Stack ‘em”: Decarceration in an Age of Zero Tolerance.  Current Issues in Criminal Justice, 28(2), 137-156., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV16N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-16-no-4-%E2%80%93-april-2017,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 16, No. 4 – April 2017",Regular Issue,2017
Child protection intervention in the form of admissions to foster care is most likely to occur in US states with punitive social policy regimes such as high incarceration rates and a high proportion of cases resulting in death sentences.,", Large numbers of children – 5.9% of all US children, 11.4% of African American children, and 15.4% of Indigenous children – enter the foster care system at some point in their lives. The variation across states is also dramatic – from a low of 1.42 to a high of 10.46 foster care entries per 1000 children in the population per year. This paper examines the variation, across states, in the use of foster care in relation to other policies, including criminal justice policies., Entry into foster care can be seen as “a regrettable but necessary component of a broad and generous welfare state…” or as “a vehicle through which states monitor and punish parents and families who fail to conform to hegemonic parenting standards” (p. 578).  However, since poverty is “among the key factors [predicting] child maltreatment” it follows that entry into foster care should be expected to relate to poverty levels. The study looks at rates of entry into foster care as a function of poverty measures as well as various other social policies.  These include programs designed to address poverty as well as criminal justice policies.  Various other social policies are included in the predictive models as well. Estimates of these indicators from the 50 states for 10 years (2002 to 2011) were included as predictors of the use of foster care., The findings suggest that the rate of entry into foster care (per 1000 child population) was lower in states with more generous welfare systems and in states with relatively lower crime rates.  However, even after crime rates were controlled for, adult incarceration rates and the number of death sentences per prison admission were positively associated with high rates of entry into foster care.   As an example of how entry into foster care is related to other social policies, it appears that, holding all other variables constant, states with the most generous welfare rates tended to have lower foster care entry rates., In addition, however, entry into foster care was related to criminal justice policies.  “A state with a criminal justice regime that is less punitive than the average state… is expected to have 3.4 foster care entries per 1000 children… whereas states with broad and punitive justice regimes are expected to place 4.9 children per 1000 into foster care.”, Conclusion: “After controlling for relevant demographic, social, and political contexts, states with expansive and generous welfare regimes place fewer children into foster care than do states with expansive and punitive criminal justice system” (p. 576).  States with high crime and high imprisonment also tended to have high rates of entry into foster care. It would appear that “disruptive methods of child protection [e.g., placing a child in foster care] are institutionally aligned with punitive forms of social control” (p. 577). In addition, given the negative relationship between welfare generosity and the foster care institutionalization rate, it would seem that states are making an implicit choice in how they deal with children growing up in poverty: to invest in more generous welfare programs or to invest in programs that move children from their families into foster care., Reference:  Edwards, Frank (2016).

Youths who are arrested during high school are less likely ever  to enroll in a four-year postsecondary education program than equivalent youths who were not arrested.,", There is substantial evidence that contact with the criminal justice system can have negative effects on youths (e.g., Criminological Highlights 14(6)#1, 11(4)#3).  This paper examines the long-term impact of arrest on an important aspect of youths’ lives: the likelihood that they will enroll in a 4-year post-secondary education program., An arrest can have a direct impact on a youth’s chances of being accepted into a college or university program since many educational institutions require applicants to provide information about their discipline history and criminal record. Surveys of college admissions officers indicate that “two thirds would consider denying admission to a student who had been convicted of marijuana distribution and half would consider denying [admission] to a student who had ever been [simply] arrested for the same crime” (p. 641).  But in addition, there can be indirect effects: “the stigma of an arrest may trigger social exclusion at school” and “teachers or guidance counselors [may] perceive arrested students as poor investments” (p. 624) and not encourage them to do what is necessary to gain admission to a 4-year program., The study used data from a large (US) longitudinal study. Youths, who had graduated from high school and who had been arrested during their first 3 years in high school, were matched with very similar students who had not been arrested.  A statistical technique (propensity score matching) was used to create equivalent groups of youth who had the same likelihood of being arrested (given their background characteristics on 59 variables such as involvement in delinquency, substance use, friends who engaged in anti-social behaviour). In this way 162 arrested youth were matched with one or more control youths (who had not been arrested)., 31% of youths who had not been arrested in high school enrolled in a four-year postsecondary institution within 9 months of graduation, compared to only 21% of those who had been arrested.  There was, however, no (significant) difference between the groups in the enrollment rates in 2-year colleges.  The difference in enrollment rates in a 4-year program between those arrested and those not arrested persisted for 10 years after graduation.  At that point, 50% of those who had not been arrested, but only 41% of those who had been arrested ever enrolled in a 4-year post-secondary education program., A substantial amount of the difference in the likelihood of enrollment in a 4-year postsecondary educational institution for those arrested and those not arrested appears to be due to two factors: grade point average and enrollment in advanced courses in the fourth year of high school.   Arrest did not significantly predict college entrance exam scores and suspensions from school did not predict enrollment in a 4-year postsecondary program, so neither factor could be said to account for the difference in 4-year postsecondary enrollment., Conclusion: Youths who are arrested in high school had a substantially lower likelihood of ever attending a 4-year post-secondary educational institution.  Given that prior to the arrest, the youths were equivalent on many relevant dimensions including cognitive abilities and involvement in crime, it would appear that being arrested sets in motion a set of processes that has a permanent negative impact on youths’ educational attainment., Reference: Widdowson, Alex O., Sonja E.

Regular – but not temporary – employment or receiving public assistance can reduce property offending by youths released from a treatment facility at age 18.,", The effect of employment on crime is not straightforward. Although it might be logical to assume that crime – especially property crime – would be less frequent if a person was employed, this relationship is not as simple or universal as some might think (see Criminological Highlights, 4(3)#6, 6(4)#5, 8(6)#4, 10(2)#3, 13(3)#5, 14(2)#7, 14(5)#7, 15(3)#3, 15(5)#3)., The analysis in this study allows one to estimate not only the effect of employment on crime (property and violent), but also the effect of engaging in crime on subsequent employment.  In addition, it allows one to separate out the effect of third variables that might lead to both unemployment and crime, for example “individual preferences and abilities that select individuals into offending [and] … into unemployment” (p. 183). Such preferences and ability could suggest, spuriously, that there was a causal relationship between unemployment and crime., In this study, 270 male youths who spent at least 2 months in a ‘judicial treatment institution’ in The Netherlands were followed from age 18 to 32.  92% had committed at least one offence prior to age 18.   Monthly data were collected from government files on temporary or continuing employment, as well as unemployment insurance, disability insurance and public assistance (a welfare payment providing the minimum income needed for subsistence).  Offending was measured as convictions for offences (identified by month of the offence) that took place during this 14 year period.  Controls were included for whether the person was incarcerated, married, or a parent., As with other ‘high risk’ offenders, this group had a relatively low employment rate: on average only 31% were employed in any given month, with about 74% of those who had any employment having regular employment.   In the sample as a whole, property crime declined with age; violent crime did not., Regular employment (where a person was on the payroll of an employer) significantly reduced a person’s subsequent property offending.  Temporary employment had no effect on a person’s subsequent property offending. Neither regular nor temporary employment had an effect on violent offending., Whether or not a person received any type of social welfare (unemployment insurance, disability insurance, or public assistance) had no overall effect on subsequent property or violent offending.  However, receiving public assistance – subsistence payments requiring no proof other than need – did appear to reduce subsequent property offending., Conclusion.  It is possible that the stability that regular employment demands in a person’s life explains why regular, but not temporary, employment appears to reduce property crime.  That apparent stability did not carry over to violent crime: employment of any kind had no impact on violent crime. Receiving public assistance – a form of social welfare provided to the most disadvantaged residents of The Netherlands where this study was carried out – did reduce property offending. However, the fact that no type of social welfare program or employment affected violent offending suggests that violent offending is largely a function of factors other than a person’s financial circumstances., Reference: Mesters, G., V. van der Geest, C.

Being imprisoned for six to twelve months has more dramatic negative impacts on employment prospects than imprisonment for less than six months.,", Those who have a criminal record have a difficult time getting a job (Criminological Highlights 4(3)#6).  But there are other reasons that those who spend time in prison may be very likely not to have work.  Those spending substantial periods of time in prison also run the risk of losing relevant work skills, becoming detached from the institution of work, and developing closer ties to those more likely to be involved in crime than with employment., This study examines the relationship between the time that a sample of 702 men spent in prison and their likelihood of being employed after release.  Sentences of a year or less are common in many countries.  In Canada, for example, approximately 90% of those released after serving a sentence of imprisonment were in prison for a year or less.  This paper, therefore, looks at those released from Dutch prisons after serving a year or less to determine what impact it has on the their employment record., The paper examines the employment records of those who were in prison for at least a week and up to a year.  “Time in prison” included both pretrial detention and sentences served immediately after conviction.  Five groups of prison lengths were created: 1-6 weeks, 3 weeks to 3 months, 3-4 months, 4-6 months, and 6-12 months.  Groups were equated by using a ‘propensity score’ technique such that pre-existing measures on each person were used to predict their likelihood of serving each of these sentence lengths.  In this way, the researchers were able to create groups of people who spent varying lengths of time in prison but who, generally, were very similar on relevant dimensions.  Employment was measured through an interview that took place approximately 6 months after release. Two different self-report techniques (which produced very similar results) were employed., There were no consistent differences among the four groups that had spent less than 6 months in prison.  In the first month after release, about 33% of those who had been in prison for less than 6 months were employed.  This increased to about 40% employed 6 months after release.  However, the time in prison did not seem to matter for those who were in prison for 6 months or less., The group that was different from the 4 groups who spent less than 6 months in prison were those who had been imprisoned for a relatively long period: 6-12 months.  In the first month after they were released, only 20% were employed.  Six months after release only about 27% were employed.  Their rate was obviously considerably lower than the employment rates for the groups imprisoned for less than 6 months.  It appears that those who spent 6-12 months in prison were both less likely than those who spent less time in prison to regain their pre-prison employment or to find new employment., The differences in employment rates did not appear to be related to treatment programs in prison or recidivism rates. Those who spent very short periods of time in prison were less likely than others to participate in any rehabilitative prison programs.  In addition, recidivism rates did not differ significantly across the groups: about one quarter of the study participants reported committing at least one offence during the 6 month follow-up period., Conclusion: It would appear that those who are imprisoned for 6 months or more are less likely to be employed after release than those who spend less time in prison.  Six months for these prisoners appeared to be an important threshold: for those who spent less time in prison, the ‘time in prison’ did not seem to matter.  But being in prison for 6 months or more did appear to reduce employment prospects.  Hence, “although employment is largely insensitive to imprisonment length among short term prisoners [i.e., those with less than 6 month prison stays], an apparent threshold exists at approximately 6 months.  Beyond 6 months, longer imprisonment corresponds with incremental deterioration in employment prospects” (p. 422)., Reference: Ramakers, Anke, Robert Apel, Paul Nieuwbeerta, Anja Dirkzwager, and Johan Van Wilsem (2014).  Imprisonment Length and Post-Prison Employment Prospects.  Criminology, 52(3), 399-427., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV16N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-16-no-4-%E2%80%93-april-2017,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 16, No. 4 – April 2017",Regular Issue,2017
Legal changes can reduce crime: A change in the law in Denmark that reduced dramatically the risk of incarceration for those convicted of certain crimes also reduced dramatically the risk that the sons of fathers convicted of these crimes would commit offences.,", There is substantial evidence that there are negative impacts of incarceration on the families of those sent to prison (e.g., Criminological Highlights 14(2)#1, 12(6)#7, 12(5)#1, 13(1)#7, 12(6)#8, 9(5)#6, 13(3)#3).  This study examines a legislative change in Denmark in 2000 that dramatically expanded the use of probation with community service as a penalty for certain offences rather than imprisonment. Looking at those not sentenced to fines (which were not targeted by the legislation) the use of imprisonment for the remaining offenders (the “treatment group”) dropped dramatically as a result of the reform., The study looks at the offending of children who were born in Denmark and were age 12-18 at the time of their fathers’ conviction. The study sample included fathers whose conviction took place in the year prior to the legislative change or the year after the reform that increased the use of probation/community service.  The dependent measure was whether children of these fathers who were convicted during this period (the year before and the year after the change in the law) were charged with a crime. A 10 year follow-up period was used (after the father’s conviction).  Various statistical controls were introduced (in three different ways) in order to eliminate effects that might be due to socioeconomic factors, family characteristics, and previous criminal justice involvement of the father.  Data were collected from centralized government registries., About 87% of the children in the pre-reform ‘treatment’ group experienced the incarceration of their fathers, compared to only about 24% of the children in the post-reform treatment group.  Hence the children in the study had quite different experiences pre- and post- reform. Within 10 years of the conviction of the father, 64% of the male children whose fathers were convicted before the reform (where the father was likely to go to prison) had been charged with an offence.  For those boys whose fathers were convicted post-reform (where the father was unlikely to be imprisoned), only 57% were charged with an offence within 10 years., In order to test whether other changes in Denmark might be responsible for any effects of the legislative change, the offending rates of children of fathers convicted of crimes (before and after the reform date) but whose offences were not covered by the legal reform were also examined.  The incarceration rate for fathers convicted of these other offences was relatively stable across the period being examined. Male offspring of these fathers, however, were charged at a slightly higher rate if the father was convicted after the reform date (a 60% offending rate) rather than before (57%).  Various statistical techniques were used to determine whether the effects of the reform for male offspring of fathers who were convicted were stable.  Looking across these analyses, it would appear that incarceration of a male child’s father increases somewhat the likelihood that the boy will commit an offence., There were, however, no consistent effects for female offspring of incarcerated fathers. Girls were considerably less likely than boys to be charged with an offence, but the incarceration of the father appeared to have no significant effect., Conclusion:  As with previous studies, it would appear that the incarceration of a parent can have harmful – in this case criminogenic – effects on children in the family.  In this case, boys – but not girls – were more likely to commit offences in the 10 years after a father’s incarceration.  When one considers, then, the intergenerational transmission of crime, it would appear that at least part of it has to do with criminal justice policies., Reference: Wildeman, Christopher and Signe Hald Andersen (2017).

Being suspended from school increases the likelihood of being arrested.,"Though it is obvious that youths who are suspended from school are likely to be more troublesome than those who are never suspended, an important question, from a policy perspective, is whether being suspended increases, decreases, or does not affect the likelihood that a youth will get into more trouble in the future., This paper uses data from the US National Longitudinal Study of Youth collected in four waves between 1997and 2000.  Each time youths were interviewed, starting when they were 14 years old, they were asked if they had received a school suspension in the previous year.  They were also asked if they had been arrested since the previous interview.  Across the whole period, 14.5% of the youths had been arrested at least once. Within each wave, about 11% of the sample reported receiving a school suspension.  Youths were also asked about their own delinquencies; the number of delinquent acts engaged in over the prior year was used as a control variable.  Other control variables included race, age, gender, and family income., The analysis examines two ways in which suspensions could affect arrests.  First, it examined the effect of a suspension in one period on a youth’s likelihood of arrest after being suspended.  Second, it looked across youths at the impact on arrests of the number of years in which the youth experienced a suspension from school., Black youths, males, older youths, those from low income families, and youths who reported higher levels of delinquency were more likely to be arrested.  But holding these factors constant, school suspensions had additional effects on arrest. Youths who were suspended were more likely to report being arrested in years in which they were suspended than in years they were not.  Looking across individuals, and controlling for these theoretically important factors, the more times youths were suspended, the higher the likelihood that they would be arrested by the police., “These findings suggest that school discipline functions as a negative turning point for some youth. Prior work… has shown that contact with the criminal justice system often begets increased contact with the criminal justice system in the future” (p. 645).  Furthermore, these data show that “even when youths stay in school [after being suspended] but receive formal punishment, they are likely to experience [additional] formal contact with the criminal justice system through arrest” (p. 646)., Conclusion:  Previous work “demonstrates that youths who experience punitive punishments are likely to find themselves in prison due, in large part, to dropping out of school” (p. 648).   In addition, however, while “prior work has shown that punitive school discipline can lead to a whole host of destructive outcomes within school, such as diminished academic performance, grade retention, and decreased extracurricular participation, [the] findings [in this study] show that school discipline may serve as an important negative turning point setting youth up for additional formal sanctions even when they remain in school” (p. 648).  The results imply that although suspension from the perspective of the school may at least temporarily rid the school of a problem, the long term impact on society may well be to increase the negative consequences for the youths who are suspended., Reference: Mowen, Thomas and John Brent (2016).  School Discipline as a Turning Point: The Cumulative Effect of Suspension on Arrest. Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency, 53(5), 628-653., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV16N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-16-no-6-%E2%80%93-october-2017,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 16, No. 6 – October 2017",Regular Issue,2017
Why do Black Americans have less confidence in the police than White Americans? A study of how police officers in one city speak to Black and White citizens whom they stop for traffic violations suggests that police show less respect toward Black citizens than toward Whites.,", In studies carried out in the US and in Canada, Black citizens typically describe their local police in less favourable terms than do Whites.   Various explanations have been offered for this consistent finding.  This study suggests that the explanation lies at least in part with the police whom they interact with: the police use different language when interacting with Black and White citizens., One of the most common ways in which citizens come in contact with the police is in routine traffic stops. Unlike many studies of police-citizen interactions, this study does not rely on assessments by those who interact with the police. Instead it uses transcribed body-camera recordings from 981 routine traffic stops of White and Black community members carried out by 245 different members of the Oakland, California, police in April 2014. From the 143 hours of footage, 36,738 usable officer utterances were obtained.  The language used in these interactions was the focus of the studies reported here., In the first study, the text of a random sample of 414 officer utterances was chosen.  Each of 70 participants (39 female, 21 male; average age: 25.3 years) looked at a batch of transcriptions of 60 of these utterances by the police to the citizen along with the text of the community member’s utterance that immediately preceded it.   They then rated the police officer’s utterance on how respectful, polite, friendly, formal, and impartial the officer was.  The participants did not know the race of the community person or the race of the police officer.   There was a very high rate of agreement on the ratings of each of the utterances by the different participants., The key findings were clear:  “Officer utterances directed toward Black drivers were perceived as less respectful, polite, friendly, formal and impartial than language directed toward white drivers… even when controlling for the age and sex of the driver” (p. 6522)., Next, a “computational linguistic model of respect and formality” was developed, so that each utterance could be rated mechanically on these dimensions.  This model included such factors as apologies from the police officer, expressions of gratitude, reassurance, use of titles and last names and positive words, etc.  The 36,738 utterances were then machine coded.  Various control factors were included (community member’s age, gender; the officer’s race, whether a search was conducted, and what the result was of the stop (warning, citation or arrest))., The rating of these utterances by the police officers showed higher respect toward Whites than Blacks.  Officer race did not contribute significantly.   The effects held across the traffic offences of varying severity.  Race of the community member was not related to the formality of the language used by police officers.  Finally, additional analyses demonstrated that the results were not due to the behaviour of a small number of police officers., Conclusion: “A person’s experiences of respect or disrespect in personal interactions with police officers play a central role in their judgements of how procedurally fair the police are as an institution, as well as their willingness to support or cooperate with the police.” (p. 6521).  The results of this study suggest that the police use less respectful language toward Black citizens than they do toward Whites. Whites are considerably more likely to hear one of the most respectful utterances; Blacks are more likely to hear one of the least respectful utterances.   It would seem that a first step toward ‘earning’ the respect of Black citizens would be for the police to talk to Blacks using the same kind of language as they use when talking to Whites., Reference:  Voight, Rob and 8 others (June 20, 2017).  Language from Police Body Camera Footage Shows Racial Disparities in Officer Respect. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 114(25), 6521-6526 + supplementary material., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV16N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-16-no-6-%E2%80%93-october-2017,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 16, No. 6 – October 2017",Regular Issue,2017
"Providing opportunities for employment for men who have offended reduces self-reported crime, but only when the men report that they had strong commitment to their jobs.",", There is a good deal of evidence that work can reduce the likelihood that some people will commit offences. However, the evidence appears to demonstrate that the relationship between employment and crime is not a simple one (see Criminological Highlights 4(3)#6, 6(5)#7, 8(6)#4, 10(2)#3, 12(4)#8, 15(6)#4, 16(5)#1)., This paper examines the relationship between employment, characteristics of that employment, and self-reported offending for 717 men who were imprisoned for felonies in the US state of Nebraska.   Using a technique known as the ‘life event calendar’ whereby personal memories can be recalled and dated, the prisoners were asked about their involvement in a range of different crimes in the 36 months prior to their incarceration.  They were also asked about whether they were working during each of these months and, if they were, they were asked about the number of hours, the pay, and whether they felt committed to the job (on a 5-point scale running from “just a job”  to “a job I was very committed to”).  Finally they were asked about their involvement in other activities (e.g., going to bars, etc.; hanging around with friends) as well as their use of alcohol and other drugs., The advantage of this “within person” design is that it was possible to see how work affected the involvement in crime within each person over the three year period. Each person is, in effect, his own control.   For each person, the analysis was limited to those months (in the 36 months prior to the incarceration during which they were interviewed) in which he was not incarcerated (and, therefore had an opportunity both to offend and to work)., In general, people who were working in a given month were less likely to report being involved in crime than those not working in each of the 36 months (34% vs. 54%). This finding, of course, could be due to pre-existing differences between those working and those not working.  Looking within individuals, however, the findings were clear: people were less involved in crime when they were working.  However, it turns out that the nature of the work is crucial in understanding its effect on crime.   There was no difference in crime between months that a person was not working and months in which they were working at low quality jobs (low pay, few hours, “just a job”).  Said differently, “low-quality work situations do not significantly reduce criminal involvement relative to periods of unemployment” (p. 323).  The number of hours worked and the income earned also made no difference., “When men are more highly committed to their jobs, they have significantly lower crime risk” (p. 323).   These effects held whether one looked at the full 36 months (leading up to eventual incarceration) or only the last 6, 12 or 24 months prior to eventual incarceration.  In all cases, it was the subjective assessment of the job that mattered rather than the hours or pay.  Work also appeared to have an effect on the ordinary activities that these men engaged in.   However, “the routine activities [the man was involved in] together explained approximately [only about] one quarter of the relationship between work and crime” (p. 335)., Conclusion:  For people who are likely to be involved in crime, being involved in work that they feel committed to appears to be effective in reducing involvement in crime. Low quality work does not, however, have this protective impact.  One explanation for the crime reducing effect of high quality work may be that it shows individuals how much they stand to lose if criminal activities resulted in a loss of the job.  “The present findings suggest that a philosophy of “just give ‘em a job, any job’ll do” is likely to be doomed from the start…. Some attention should be devoted to the subjective evaluations of participants about the jobs that are made available [to them]” (p. 336)., Reference:  Apel, Robert and Julie Horney (2017).  How and Why Does Work Matter?  Employment Conditions, Routine Activities, and Crime among Adult Male Offenders. Criminology 55(2), 307-343., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV16N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-16-no-6-%E2%80%93-october-2017,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 16, No. 6 – October 2017",Regular Issue,2017
Canadian courts attempt to control the behaviour of people who are awaiting trial by placing conditions on their release on bail that restrict their freedom in a manner not contemplated by current bail laws.,", On an average night, about 35% of Canadian prisoners are ‘remand’ prisoners – typically awaiting trial.   Said differently, about a third of Canadian prisoners are legally innocent.  The rate of remand imprisonment has been increasing slowly since the early 1980s and cannot be attributed to any single change in legislation. The increase also cannot be attributed to increases in crime: Crime, including violent crime has been decreasing since the early 1990s., The 1972 Bail Reform Act suggested that release on bail should be presumed and that the prosecution must demonstrate a need for an accused person to be detained. Since then, successive governments first created and then added to the list of offences or circumstances in which an accused must demonstrate that release on bail is warranted.   The problem that has, until recently, not received much attention is the setting of conditions on those released on bail., This paper uses data from 152 days of observations of bail proceedings in 11 adult Ontario courts between 2006 and 2013.  Most accused were released with the consent of the Crown.  However, most (76%) of those released required a surety to guarantee their appearance in court and adherence to an average of 7.8 conditions of release.  Most (64%) accused persons released on bail were prohibited from possessing any weapons; 63% were required to live with their sureties; 20% were required to abstain from drugs; 18% were required to abstain from alcohol.  Other conditions included not being within certain areas of the city (27%), house arrest (7%), and curfews (19%).  There were some conditions that appeared to flow from the allegations against the accused (e.g., no contact with witness/victim (50%)).  On the other hand, there were some conditions such as “being amenable to the rules and discipline of the home” (71%) that were both vague and apparently unrelated to the offence., The problem is simple: accused (and their lawyers) will agree to almost anything to obtain release especially since the bail process is itself remarkably inefficient (Criminological Highlights, 15(2)#1).  But then once the conditions are imposed, violating them puts an accused person in jeopardy of a new criminal charge (failure to comply with a court order).  The law indicates that “conditions are supposed to address the grounds upon which the accused would have otherwise been detained and be rationally connected to addressing these grounds” (p. 677).   Instead, what we see are conditions being placed on accused people that do not relate to the offence (see also, Criminological Highlights, 13(5)#5).  Given that legally innocent accused may be living with these restrictions for many months, it is not surprising that conditions are sometimes violated. In about 10% of criminal cases in Canada, a bail violation is the most serious charge in the case., Conclusion:  Accused people are clearly being punished by courts that place restrictions on them which often have little or no bearing on the offence that was the basis of the original charge.  These conditions are obviously experienced as punishment.  “The result is a blurring of the lines between the presumed innocent and the proven guilty” (p. 682). At around the time that this paper was published, the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Antic (2017 SCC 27) noted that “It is time to ensure that the bail provisions are applied consistently and fairly. The stakes are too high for anything less. Pre-trial custody ‘affects the mental, social, and physical life of the accused and his family’ and may also have a ‘substantial impact on the result of the trial itself’” (para 66).  The Supreme Court then restated, in plain language, Canada’s law.  This paper demonstrates that such a restatement was clearly necessary., Reference: Myers, Nicole Marie (2017).

People being sentenced whose faces are independently judged to be attractive (or young and innocent-looking) are less likely to be perceived as threatening and less likely to be sentenced to prison.,", There is a long history of social science research suggesting that what people look like affects the manner in which they are judged by others.  “People routinely make character judgements based on physical appearance and… these judgements are consequential for individual life outcomes” (p. 520)., This study extends this line of research into decision-making in the criminal justice system by examining the sentencing outcomes for a random sample of 1,119 male felony defendants who were sentenced under the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area., Standardized colour facial ‘booking photos’ were located for these offenders.   Each of these photos was rated by four people (2 males and 2 females; two Blacks, 1 White, and 1 Hispanic) on perceived dangerousness, violence, blameworthiness, and ability to serve time in prison.  The people doing the rating had no information about any of the people in the photos.  The four scores were averaged across raters.  A score of “threatening appearance” was created by combining the four highly correlated measures.  In addition, the defendant’s race and the presence of tattoos and scars were assessed (from the photo) as was the defendants’ perceived attractiveness and whether the defendant was described as “baby- vs. mature-faced.”, The sentence received was categorized as a non-prison sentence, a suspended prison sentence, and a prison sentence.   Various controls were taken into account: the presumptive sentence under the guidelines, the offender’s age, criminal history, offence type, whether the accused had a private attorney, and whether the accused was convicted at trial., Above and beyond the control factors, Blacks offenders were seen as more threatening and Asian Americans were seen as less threatening than White offenders. Those who were judged as being attractive, being “baby-faced” and not having scars or tattoos were seen as less threatening., Those defendants judged to be more attractive or baby-faced were more likely to be sentenced leniently even when other legally relevant factors (e.g., the presumptive sentence, the offence and the criminal history) were taken into account.  Interestingly, however, whether or not the offender was judged to have a ‘threatening appearance’ did not seem to be independently important in determining the sentence., Conclusion: The results of this study appear to support the conclusion that “the power of facial appearance to prejudice perceivers could lead to alarming bias in the criminal justice system” (p. 536). The findings “reveal that defendant appearance invokes social attributions that connect certain offenders to enhanced impressions of danger, violence, culpability, and suitability to prison” (p. 538).  Obviously the sentencing guideline and the criminal history score were important factors in determining the sentence these offenders received.  But above and beyond these factors certain facial characteristics (e.g., low attractiveness) were associated with a higher likelihood of receiving a sentence of imprisonment., Reference: Johnson, Brian D. and Ryan D.

The problems facing Canada’s First Nations when they establish their own police services are predictable and perhaps inevitable. It would appear that a new approach to self-administered police services in these small communities is needed.,", Canada’s First Nations Policing Programs allow Indigenous communities to set up their own police services that are funded by provincial and federal governments.  These communities do, however, have an alternative: contracting with existing (non-Indigenous) police services., Between 1992 and 2017, 58 self-administered (SA) First Nations police services had been established across Canada, but by January 2017 20 of them had been disbanded.  The question this paper addresses is whether SA police services were set up to fail., SA First Nations police services tend to be small (average 22.1 officers), as are the communities they serve (e.g., as small as 361 people).   Many of the communities are not accessible by road.  The largest SA First Nations police service has responsibility for 35 geographically separated communities and has 134 officers and 30 civilians.   Funding arrangements are negotiated every 5 years for each community separately.  This paper examined results of a survey of sworn officers from these services, interviews with some senior officers, and publicly available documents., One reason for the failure of many of these services is that, as new institutions in small communities, they were politically vulnerable in part because of the inevitable lack of experience and management skills of those in charge.  Perhaps because they were new and were serving small communities, there were also internal political tensions. About half of the officers in SA services reported that political interference was a serious problem.   There were also suggestions that political interference may have contributed to another problem: high personnel turnover.  In addition, of course, the social and crime problems in many First Nations communities make the challenge of being the principal ‘first responders’ to all problems even more acute.  The majority of First Nations police officers saw suicide, family violence, child welfare problems, drug or alcohol problems and feuding families/groups as being serious., Because the funding for these police services is completely external (and negotiated in 5-year contracts), the flexibility that ordinary municipalities have (e.g., to raise taxes for more policing or special police needs) does not exist.  In addition, their small size – and often remote locations – provide additional challenges.   Infrastructure funding (e.g., for holding cells, secure storage,  or communication) is typically not independently budgeted.  If officers are not from the community, housing for them is often not immediately available.  These problems make it difficult to recruit and retain officers, especially since large agencies like the RCMP provide housing for officers in remote locations.   Generally speaking, officers in SA police are more likely to see inadequate resources as a problem than are officers who police First Nations communities on contract with the Ontario Provincial Police or RCMP.  Ironically, there is some evidence that the proportion of Indigenous officers policing First Nations communities has been decreasing in recent years., Conclusion:  The goal of encouraging Canada’s First Nations to have their own self-administered police services may have been a good one.  However, it appears that “the manner in which the program has been implemented has compromised its potential efficacy…. These police services often suffer from internal challenges such as small size, the small populations served, and political interference in policing…. Many of these problems appear to be relate to “the lack of stable and consistent funding that is appropriate to meet the demands in Indigenous communities” (p. 594). One important question, then, is whether, by setting up small stand-alone police agencies, Canada is ignoring the fact that these types of agencies are disappearing elsewhere in the world., Reference:  Kiedrowski, John, Nicholas A. Jones, and Rick Ruddell (2017).  ‘Set up to Fail?’  An Analysis of Self-administered Indigenous Police Services in Canada. Police Practice and Research, 18(6), 584-598., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV16N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-16-no-6-%E2%80%93-october-2017,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 16, No. 6 – October 2017",Regular Issue,2017
The presence of a drug court in a community can encourage police to bring minor drug cases to court that otherwise they would have ignored.,", The idea behind drug courts is that drug-dependent accused people, rather than being sent to prison, should be provided with treatment as an alternative to incarceration.  This study examines whether drug courts might have another effect – unintentionally encouraging drug arrests of those accused of minor drug offences., There are three reasons to be concerned that the presence of a drug court in a community might lead to increased arrests: (1) that drug courts are seen as an effective tool to control (drug related) crime in a community; (2) The belief that law is an effective therapeutic tool to link drug-related offenders, who are viewed as being sick or injured, with appropriate services; (3)The belief that through a community restorative drug court process family, friends, etc., can be mobilized to find effective solutions to problems the accused person is believed to be facing.   One problem is that studies of participants in drug court suggest that many (perhaps a third) score below the minimum threshold for drug dependency.  One study found that only 6% of drug court participants were above the moderate range of addiction severity. Drug courts, in other words, appear to have a large number of “clients” who don’t have drug addiction problems., This study examines drug arrests during a period when many cities were just beginning to create drug courts (1990-2002).   The main focus was on arrests for drug use in each of 8,137 US jurisdictions during this time.    The hypothesis tested was a simple one: drug use arrests (per 10,000 residents) might be expected to increase in the years after a city created a local drug court.   Various characteristics of each jurisdiction were controlled for including support for and size of police services, arrests for disorder offences, as well as the racial makeup of the community, proportion of the population age 15-24, average  income, and employment rate., The analysis was one that “allowed pre-post comparisons among drug court jurisdictions while including non-participating jurisdictions as a control for overall nationwide trends in drug arrests.  As such, the relative change in arrest rates was compared both within drug court jurisdictions (before and after) and between these jurisdictions [that had drug courts] and those that were never served by a drug court” (p. 689-690).  Obviously, however, since drug courts are not implemented on a random basis, causal inferences should be made with caution., Looking across all cities, arrests for serious crime and disorder decreased, but the rate of arrests for drug offences increased.   More importantly, there was a significant increase in drug arrests, during this period (1990-2002), after a jurisdiction implemented a drug court.  Various analyses were carried out (e.g., looking at relatively large and small cities separately, looking only at counties (and excluding cities and townships).  The results were the same: the implementation of a drug court in a jurisdiction was associated with an increase in the likelihood that police would charge minor drug offenders., Conclusion: “Drug courts were developed to aid the expansion of alternatives to incarceration for individuals with drug or alcohol dependencies who were charged with non-violent [offences]…. However, arrests for misdemeanor drug offences increased substantially during the 12 years following creation of this experimental program in 1989. Regression analyses in this study provide clear evidence that cities and counties that created drug courts experienced increases, rather than declines in arrest for misdemeanor drug use and possession” (p. 690).  It seems likely, therefore, that the availability of drug courts encourages police to bring minor drug users to court., Reference: Lilley, David R.

Parental incarceration contributes to intergenerational socioeconomic inequality.,", The high rates of imprisonment in the United States beginning in the mid-1970s meant that an increasing number of children experienced the imprisonment of one or both parents.  In some American schools, as many as a quarter of the fathers and a tenth of the mothers of the children in the school experienced imprisonment.  The negative impacts that the incarceration of a parent has on their children is beginning to be understood  (see The Effects of Imprisonment: Specific Deterrence and Collateral Effects — Research Summaries Compiled from Criminological Highlights)., Because mass incarceration started some time ago, it is now possible to examine the long-term impact on the offspring of parents who were incarcerated when the children were young.   This study examines the intergenerational effects of parental imprisonment on the earnings, feelings of powerlessness, and perceived socioeconomic status of those who experienced the incarceration of a parent.  The survey used in this study began in 1994 with a focus on children born in the 1980s.  The main outcome data were obtained in 2007-8 when the survey participants were in their late 20s and early 30s. Overall, about 16% had experienced, when they were children, the incarceration of their father; 4% had experienced the incarceration of their mother., These young adults were asked their annual earnings, their feelings of powerlessness (by indicating their level of agreement with statements such as “There is really no way I can solve the problems I have”) and perceived socioeconomic status in which respondents indicated where they felt they stood on a 10-point scale of “where people stand in America” on money, education, and respected jobs., Various school characteristics (e.g., parental imprisonment rates; attendance rates; racial characteristics of the school) as well as individual characteristics of the respondent (perceived closeness to each parent, parental education, race, gender, household income, family structure) were controlled for., Above and beyond these control factors, the imprisonment of the father or the mother each decreased the likelihood that a youth would receive a post-secondary degree.  When looking at personal earnings (when the respondents were in their late 20s-early 30s), paternal but not maternal incarceration had the effect of reducing the respondent’s personal earnings.  The imprisonment of the father or the mother each had a negative impact on the young adult’s perceived socioeconomic status.  Having experienced the imprisonment of either parent led to young adults reporting reduced socioeconomic accomplishments.   Finally, experiencing the imprisonment of one’s mother (but not father) increased a young adult’s feelings of powerlessness. Clearly the imprisonment of a parent has long term effects., Conclusion: “These findings are evidence of a trajectory of parental incarceration effects well into adulthood – net of a wide range of other factors – on the future socioeconomic prospects and social exclusion of the children of the American prison generation….  The educational attainment of the children of incarcerated parents is largely the mediating variable [for these effects]” (p. 441-2).  “Parental incarceration thus compromises the educational outcomes of children and their prospects for achieving the socioeconomic success that is central to the American Dream” (p. 423)., Reference: Foster, Holly and John Hagan (2016).  Maternal and Paternal Imprisonment and Children’s Social Exclusion in Young Adulthood.  Journal of Criminal Law & Criminology, 105(2), 387-429., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV16N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-16-no-6-%E2%80%93-october-2017,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 16, No. 6 – October 2017",Regular Issue,2017
"Judges use different types of strategies in responding to racial disparities in the criminal justice system. One of those strategy types – a noninterventionist approach that focuses only on judges’ own possible differential treatment – helps explain the persistence, despite well-intentioned judging, of racial disparities in the system.","There is little doubt that in many countries certain groups (e.g., Blacks, Indigenous people) are over-represented in the criminal justice system. Two explanations have been offered: The disparate impact explanation suggests that it relates to offending rates (e.g., as a result of differences in economic resources or in neighbourhood and school environments) or differential susceptibility to being charged (e.g., because of differential policing).  The differential treatment explanation suggests that police, prosecutors, etc., engage in “overt or implicit discriminatory treatment” (p. 333).  Understanding “judges’ interpretations [of racial disparities] would improve our understanding of their role in the reproduction of racial disparities” (p. 335). In this study, most (42 of 55) of the judges interviewed offered both explanations, but 13 of the 55 attributed racial disparities to disparate impact alone., This paper suggests that judges, guided in part by their understandings of racial disparities, have different approaches about how best to address disparities at four different stages of the justice process – arraignment (where charges are accepted and pretrial release decisions are made), plea hearing, jury selection and jury management, and sentencing., At each of the four stages of the process, judges interviewed employed  either a non-interventionist or an interventionist strategy.  For example, at plea hearings involving Black defendants, judges using a non-interventionist strategy reported simply accepting the plea agreement that had been offered.  Alternatively, some judges reported using an interventionist strategy – where, for example, they might reject or question the agreement if it appeared to be different from what most White defendants would receive.  With respect to jury selection, judges in this jurisdiction using an interventionist strategy might choose the jury foreperson to match the defendant’s race and do what was possible to ensure that there were at least some jurors chosen of the same race as the defendant.  At sentencing, judges using an interventionist strategy might attempt to craft sentences that account for “the disparate impact of poverty and restricted life chances” (p. 351) on minority defendants.  A judge using a noninterventionist approach at this stage might simply strive for consistency across racial groups within his or her own sentences., Judges’ willingness to employ interventionist strategies varied across the four stages of the court process.  About a quarter of the judges employed interventionist strategies at the arraignment and jury selection stages, but only about 15% at plea hearings and at sentencing.  Although about half reported using non-interventionist strategies at all stages, all but one of the remainder reported having different approaches at different stages., Conclusion:  “Judges… employ two sets of strategies – noninterventionist and interventionist – that manifest themselves differently at different stages of the court process. Noninterventionist strategies largely allow racial disparities to go unchecked with respect to possible differential treatment by other actors and with respect to the disparate impact of the criminal justice system, whereas interventionist strategies attempt to address these processes” (p. 353). Hence “even when judges are not explicitly racist and even when they acknowledge, and attempt to account for, their implicit biases, they still may unintentionally contribute to racial disparities through noninterventionist decision-making that does not account for potential differential treatment by others or for the disparate impact of poverty or facially neutral laws….” (p. 354)., Reference:  Clair, Matthew and Alix S.

American cities that only recently became new destinations for immigrants experienced large decreases in levels of crime.,", Until the 1990s, most immigrants to the US settled in a relatively small number of cities. Since, then, however, immigrants have begun settling in cities that, before 1990, had very few immigrants.  This study looks at the impact of large increases in the number of immigrants in cities that, prior to 1990, had few immigrant residents., There is substantial evidence that large concentrations of immigrants in US cities is, if anything, associated with lower levels of crime (e.g., Criminological Highlights 10(6)#7, 11(1)#4, 13(6)#7).  This study asks a related question: what happens when immigrants move into ‘new destinations’ – cities that once had low concentrations of immigrants., Crime data for 1252 American cities and towns with populations of at least 20,000 in 2007 were obtained for two periods – 1999-2001 and 2005-2007.  “New destinations” were defined as cities or towns in which the number of foreign born increased by at least 150% between 1990 and 2005 and which had at least 1000 foreign born in 2005.  The analysis examines the change in crime rates between 1999-2001 and 2005-7 as a function of changes in an index that combined the percent recent foreign born (those who entered the US in the previous 5 years) with percent Latino. Various controls were included including changes in the overall population, percent of the community who were males age 15-29, measures of economic disadvantage, and household instability., “Despite surges in immigration of at least 150%…., new destinations appear to have experienced greater declines in crime than places that did not experience such growth.  This was especially the case for property crime….” (p. 38).  Generally speaking, across all 1252 cities and towns, those locations in which the concentration of immigrants increased tended, if anything, to have lower levels of overall crime as well as violent and property crime.  However, the decreases were not statistically significant.  The most important finding comes from an examination of ‘new destinations.’   Large increases in the numbers of immigrants between 1999-2001 and 2005-7 in these ‘new destinations’ were statistically significantly associated with decreases in overall crime, as well as in violent crime and property crime., Conclusion:  Social disorganization theory “suggests that immigration is one of several large-scale social processes that can operate to foster crime by increasing social heterogeneity and residential instability….” (p. 38).   The findings “contrast sharply with hypotheses drawn from [this] theory…” (p. 39).  It would appear that when new immigrants settle in ‘new destinations’, their impact overall is even larger than it is in cities where their increased presence would not be as obvious.”   At this point, however, it is not clear whether the crime-reducing impact of high concentrations of immigrants in ‘new destinations’ is a result of self-selection of immigrants who settle in these ‘new destinations’ or if the reduction is the result of some other factor.  What is clear, however, is that current non-immigrant residents of ‘new destinations’ do not have to be concerned that the arrival of new immigrants will be associated  with increased crime., Reference: Ferraro, Vincent (2016).  Immigration and Crime in the New Destinations, 2000-2007: A Test of the Disorganizing Effect of Migration.  Journal of Quantitative Criminology, 32, 23-45., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV16N1.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-16-no-1-%E2%80%93-august-2016,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 16, No. 1 – August 2016",Regular Issue,2016
"Experiencing problems with debt is intimately related to crime: Having debt problems increases the likelihood of committing crimes, and committing crimes increases the likelihood of experiencing debt problems.",", Crime is not evenly distributed across groups that differ in wealth.  Experiencing problems related to debt, however, is quite separate from income disparity or wealth.  This study examines the reciprocal relationship between experiencing debt problems and criminal offending, controlling for various social and economic factors known to be related to offending., There are many reasons to believe that experiencing debt and offending would be related.  For example, those who are characterized as having low self-control appear to be more likely to commit crime, and they also might be more likely to incur debt. Alternatively, those experiencing debt may be more motivated to commit property crimes.  This paper attempts to disentangle the causal relationship between debt and crime by, among other things, looking longitudinally at changes in debt problems and offending within individuals., The study was carried out in Finland, a country in which it was possible to link records of registered debts, socioeconomic characteristics of the population, and offending data over a seven year period.  The study focuses on 150,010 individuals who were between 20 and 30 years old at the start of the key period of the study (2005).   There were, in a sense, two related studies: an examination of variation in crime at one point (2005-6) in time related to the characteristics of the sample, and a longitudinal study of the relationship between changes in debt status and offending during the period 2005-2012., “Young people with low education, low income, and limited employment history have an above-average risk of ending up with debt problems” (p. 324). However, experiencing debt problems in 2005-6 was also related to higher rates of both property and violent offending in that same year even when other individual characteristics (age, sex, education, income level, whether the person was working or unemployed,  whether they owned property, and whether their parents experienced debt in 2004) were taken into account., When variation in offending within individuals across time was examined in relation to changes in debt problems, it was discovered that the relationship between experiencing debt problems and crime was still evident, but was much smaller than when this same relationship was examined across individuals, suggesting that some, but not all, of the overall relationship is due to differences in individuals. In addition, it was found that within individuals, “the increase in levels of crime takes place almost instantly after the start of the debt default period” (p. 322) reinforcing the conclusion that the experience of debt increases crime.  After that initial increase, crime did not increase.   In addition, however, crime-related debt (unpaid fines) increases after conviction and remains relatively high throughout the follow-up period., Conclusion:  When looking at individuals over a 7 year period, it appears that crime was more likely to occur during periods of debt enforcement. Though this association was stronger for property crime than it was for violent crime, the association between debt and violent crime was significant.  The process, however, “is reciprocal, where levels of non-crime-related debt increase slightly before the crime is committed, and crime related fines in turn contribute to levels of debt problems when they enter into enforcement after being initially left unpaid” (p. 325).  If we are  interested in encouraging those who have committed offences to desist from crime, we should consider the possibility that “an emerging desire to leave a life of crime behind is hampered by the burden of debt caused by the earlier criminal lifestyle and resulting periods of incarceration” (p. 327), Reference: Aaltonen, Mikko, Atte Oksanen, and Janne Kivivuori (2016).  Debt Problems and Crime.  Criminology, 54(2), 307-331., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV16N1.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-16-no-1-%E2%80%93-august-2016,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 16, No. 1 – August 2016",Regular Issue,2016
"After-school programs designed to prevent youths from committing offences are often viewed favourably by youths, but a review of high-quality evaluations of these programs suggests that one cannot count on them to reduce offending.",", After-school programs are seen as having the potential of reducing offending by youths. Theoretically, they could lead to a reduction in offending for a number of reasons including the possibility that they reduce the amount of time youths spend unsupervised by adults. They might also be effective if they reduced the amount of time that crime-prone youths spent with more delinquent youths.  Alternatively, the activities that the youths are exposed to might themselves have crime-reducing effects., This review examined all studies that could be found that evaluated the crime reducing impact of after-school programs. The programs that were examined were ones that targeted youths who otherwise would have been unsupervised.  Outcome measures varied somewhat across studies but all involved some estimate of delinquent or antisocial behaviour., The first challenge, however, was to find evaluations that were high quality.  A key component of being high quality was that there had to be a comparison group that was similar to the treatment group. The design could involve a randomized experiment or it could include some other approach resulting in an equivalent group of youths who did not have access to an after-school program.  Over 11,000 papers about after-school programs were found, though only 36 could be found that would qualify as evaluations of the programs. Of these, only 12 studies qualified as competent evaluations with sufficient data and other relevant information available to be able to understand and evaluate both the design and the results., Of these 12 studies, only three reported significant crime reduction associated with participation in the after-school program.  More concerning is the fact that two studies reported findings showing that participation in after-school programs was associated with increased offending.  Pooling across all 12 studies, the only conclusion one could come to is that, as a group, after-school programs have not been shown to have favourable impacts on crime., Intervention treatments varied across studies. Five studies involved academic programs, 2 focused on recreation, and 5 involved skills training or mentoring.  Treatments took place in different contexts; some focused only on ‘high risk’ youths; some involved high school students while others involved primary school students;  different measures (official reports of crime vs. self-reports) were used; some studies involved randomized experiments, others involved some type of quasi-experimental design. No grouping of studies had overall favourable effects.  Hence it could not be demonstrated that some subset of after-school programs is effective in reducing offending., Conclusion:  Although one cannot conclude that after-school programs are effective in reducing crime, this does not mean that they should be discontinued.  As one researcher noted, they “serve real needs for parents. Even without evidence of crime prevention effectiveness, public expenditures on [them] may be well-spent” (p. 285).  After-school programs are designed with many purposes in mind.  Crime prevention may be only one such purpose. What is clear, however, is that to the extent that after-school programs are justified as having favourable impacts on youths, it is necessary “to ensure that the program is implemented as planned and remains true to theoretical and operational design parameters” (p. 286).  In addition, if they are justified by their effects on youth,  rigorous research designs need to be built into the programs that will allow strong inferences about their effectiveness., Reference: Taheri, Sema and Brandon C.

"Juvenile drug courts vary considerably in their goals, target populations, and treatment activities.  A study of nine such courts found consistency on two dimensions: there was no evidence that they reduced reoffending and they focused their efforts on youths who did not generally use drugs or alcohol in ways that were unusually harmful.",", Specialty courts are popular for many reasons, among them being that those brought to criminal courts – as youths or adults – often are facing other challenges.  The question, however, is not whether many who are brought to court have various mental health or related needs that might benefit from treatment, but rather whether criminal courts are well-placed to provide effective help., This paper examines a set of 9 juvenile drug courts in four regions in the US.  The courts were similar in that after identifying youths who were using illegal drugs, the courts rewarded the youths for cooperation and punished them for non-compliance.  Typically youths were released when it was deemed that they had been cured of their drug problem. However, as often is the case when the focus is more on the name of the institution (‘drug courts’) rather than the substance of the treatment (what happens to the youths), there seemed to be little research-based treatment knowledge driving the operation of the drug courts., 686 youths in juvenile drug courts in 9 jurisdictions were matched with 686 ‘ordinary young offenders.’ Youths were matched on a risk assessment instrument, race, gender, and drug/alcohol abuse/dependence. Though the matching was not perfect, differences between the groups were subsequently controlled statistically. In addition, a separate analysis including only those who constituted ‘good matches’ was carried out, with substantially similar results., One problem with juvenile drug courts was evident from the start: “The majority of [youths in drug courts] did not engage in problem [drug] use nor did they take drugs that might be considered to be more serious, such as cocaine or opiates.  Additionally, [another measure obtained from the youths] suggests that these youths had fairly low treatment readiness…   This might limit responsiveness to intervention” (p. 309)., Two measures of recidivism were used: arrest/referral to court and formal adjudication of charges by a court (juvenile or adult).  Compared to control youths, juveniles sent to drug court were more likely to be arrest/referred to court and more likely to have their charges formally adjudicated.  This was examined both for the period of time when the youths were being supervised and afterwards. Statistically, the youth’s measured risk level, age, sex, and race were all controlled in these analyses. In general, the youths in the drug courts were more likely to recidivate than ‘ordinary’ youths. Drug court youths were more likely to fail drug tests, to be found to have violated a condition of supervision or to show violations related to schools, perhaps as a result of higher levels of supervision.   A separate analysis involving those who completed drug court or probation successfully also found that those going to drug court had, if anything, higher reoffending rates., Conclusion:  Although research has found that some drug courts for adults have favourable outcomes, this study underlines one of the standard effects of ‘treatments’ assigned to youths: They tend not to be effective when assigned to youths who have little need for treatment.  These nine drug courts contained significantly more low risk youths than the control group.  Furthermore the regime generally lasted 9-18 months.  The drug of choice for the youths was generally marijuana (71% of the youths) or alcohol (24%). 67% reported using drugs or alcohol less than once a week.  In addition, the treatments that were used – talk therapy and education – have been shown to have limited effects, and families and other caregivers were typically not involved.  Creating a ‘drug court’ clearly is not on its own sufficient. Attention needs to be focused on who is sent to such special programs, what the treatment consists of, and how it is delivered., Reference: Sullivan, Christopher J., Lesli Blair, Edward Latessa & Carrie Coen Sullivan (2014).

A review of high quality studies demonstrates that sex offender treatment can reduce reoffending.,", A previous review of sex offender treatment programs (Criminological Highlights 9(5)#7) found that sex offender recidivism could be reduced with appropriate treatment. Determining the effectiveness of sex offender treatment is difficult because sex offending itself is a very heterogeneous category, treatment approaches vary dramatically, and assessing effectiveness is difficult because rates of sexual recidivism are quite low.  Most studies of sex offender treatment, however, are inadequate – typically because of the difficulty of identifying appropriate comparison groups., This paper looks only at those studies in which there were no serious doubts that the comparison group (i.e. the group that did not receive treatment) was equivalent, prior to treatment, to the treatment group.  It is, therefore, slightly more selective than the earlier review in that the requirement of an equivalent non-treatment control was more rigorous.  In all, after examining more than 2,000 papers, the researchers identified 27 studies (involving 29 independent comparisons of a treatment group with a control group) that were scientifically rigorous enough to be included in this review. About half were published after 2000., The majority of the studies (21 of the 29) involved cognitive-behavioural treatment and almost all (26) involved treatment programs aimed specifically at sex offenders.  They were largely carried out in Canada (11 studies), the US (8), Great Britain (3) or Germany (3). Only 6 of the 29 studies involved random assignment.  Outcome measures consisted of conviction for a new offence for some studies and arrests or new charges for others. Follow-up periods ranged from one year to almost 20 years, with 24 of the 29 comparisons involving follow-up periods of more than 3 years.  The 29 comparisons involved data from 4,939 treated and 5,448 untreated sex offenders., The average sex offence recidivism rate (pooled across studies) for those who were treated was 10.1% compared to 13.7% for those not receiving treatment.  Though this difference was highly significant, it is obviously not large, in part because the rates of committing new sex offences for those convicted of sex offences are so low., Some studies also reported rates of general reoffending.  The average general reoffending rate for the treated groups was 32.6%; for the untreated it was 41.2%.  All of these figures should be interpreted cautiously since the follow-up periods varied considerably across studies.  What is clear, however, is that the treated group generally did better., The largest effects came from two studies involving multi-systemic therapy.  The size of the effects from the 20 cognitive-behavioural therapy treatment studies was statistically significant, but much smaller.  Other forms of treatment did not show statistically significant positive impacts., Conclusion: “Taken together, the… analyses of reasonably well-controlled evaluations suggest that treatment of sexual offenders can be effective, but the results are not homogeneous.  In particular, treatment in prisons and pure group formats seem to be less promising [than treatment outside of prison and treatments that include at least some individual therapy] …. Research and practice should ask more frequently what [form of therapy] works for whom, in what contexts, under what conditions, with regard to what outcomes, and also why” (p. 623).  Knowing that change in re-offending rates is possible with those who have committed sex offences is a good first step, but it is only a first step., Reference: Schmucker, Martin and Friedrich Lösel (2015).

"Although we know quite a bit about the effects of restorative justice conferences, there appears to be a reluctance to use these techniques on a systematic basis in many countries.",", Previous research has suggested that restorative justice conferences can be useful in responding to criminal offending, though there is some evidence that suggests that they are more likely to be effective as a supplement than as a substitute for normal case processing (Criminological Highlights 9(5)#1, 10(1)#6,  15(4)#4)., This paper looks at 12 randomized experiments examining the effects of restorative justice conferences (RJC) in Australia and England. Unlike many restorative justice interventions, there was a serious attempt to test the effect of a single controlled model of delivery or conferences in which trained facilitators were “told to ask just 3 questions… and to ensure that everyone had a chance to say all that they wanted about each question.  The questions were (1) What happened? (2) Who was affected by it and how? and (3) What should the offender do to try to repair the harm caused by the crime?” (p. 505)., In some of the 12 experiments, victims who participated in RJCs were less fearful of a repeat attack from the same person. Victims also tended to be more pleased with the manner in which their cases were handled if they had participated in an RJC., For certain types of conferences, the frequency (but not the likelihood) of reoffending was reduced in the short, but not the long term.  Findings from two of the studies suggested that for certain types of cases, the experience of an RJC was, at least in the short term, criminogenic, though these effects did not persist over time. Generally, however, the results suggest that there is a reduction in subsequent offending associated with participation in an RJC, though it is important to note that the effects are not uniform. Furthermore, it is clear that those offenders who did participate in the conferences were more favourable about the criminal justice process than were those who received normal criminal justice processing., The history of these RJC random-assignment experiments was not straightforward.  It was never easy to get cases referred to RJC programs, particularly in those locations in which the RJC (on a random basis) was to be used as a substitute for court processing.  In two of the studies, it was estimated that only 11%-12% of ‘eligible’ cases were referred.  Given this high degree of selection of cases, it is difficult to know whether the results would generalize to a less highly (police-selected) sample.  Said differently, even if RJCs are effective for the type of cases that have been referred to this procedure, we don’t know if the findings would be the same for a broader selection of cases., The researchers were successful in running actual experiments: Cases were successfully assigned at random to RJC or treatment as usual.  And given that these experiments used a well-defined method of running RJCs, it means we know what treatment was actually delivered., Conclusion:  Restorative justice conferences (RJCs) clearly have favourable effects in some, but not all, types of cases.  The difficulty in attracting cases to RJCs limits our ability to know whether such approaches would be effective with a more heterogeneous set of cases.  One problem is that RJCs apparently are more likely to be conducted with people involved in minor matters than serious crimes, which may reflect “poor triage [since this practice means] giving  RJCs to people who have little need of it, and denying it to those whose need is greatest” (p. 534)., Reference: Sherman, Lawrence W. and 10 others (2015).

"Most of the explanations that have been offered for the ‘crime drop’ that has occurred in many western countries are plausible sounding, but they are each almost certainly inadequate.",", Whether one looks at the results of victimization surveys or police reported crime, it would appear that the rates of many categories of crime have dropped quite dramatically in recent decades in many countries including the US, Canada, England & Wales, Australia, and New Zealand., Many explanations have been offered for the drop.  This paper suggests that none of them is a sufficient explanation though some may offer a partial explanation for the drop in certain crime rates. Previous work has tended to suggest ‘single factor’ explanations, such as the aging of the population. However, changing demographics (see Criminological Highlights 2(6)#7, 5(4)#4) may account for a small portion of the drop for some offences but not all of it. Similarly, it can quite easily be shown that explanations based on a specific change in society, such as the availability of abortion, are almost certainly wrong (Criminological Highlights 9(6)#8)., This paper takes a different approach.  It examines each of 17 hypotheses about the crime drop and uses four ‘tests’ of the ability of each explanation to account for the changes that took place, in recent decades, in crime rates. The four tests are the following:, (1) Can the explanation be applied to different countries? On the ‘abortion’ issue, for example, the crime trends for Canada and the US are very similar, but only the US had changes in the availability of abortion at the critical time in question., (2) Before crime rates went down, they typically went up quite rapidly.  Does the explanation account for this increase?, (3) Some rates for some crimes have increased recently. Can the explanation account for that variation?, (4) The timing of the crime drop.  Can the explanation account for the fact that the changes in  rates vary across types of crime?, Seventeen hypotheses have been proposed for the crime drop.  These include the following:, changing demographics, a strong economy, consumer confidence/price inflation, laws that allow the carrying of concealed weapons, gun control laws, capital punishment, changes in rates of imprisonment, new or changes in policing strategies, more police, waning of the hard drug market, legalization of abortion, lead poisoning, immigration, civilizing processes, internet-induced changes in life styles, cell phone ownership and guardianship, and improved security systems., As already noted, these explanations have one important thing in common: they choose a possible cause that could affect large numbers of people (e.g., the presence of lead), note that there is a change in that hypothetically causal variable, and then correlate that change in the causal variable to changes in crime (in this case, when youths who grew up in an environment when lead was presumably more likely to be in the atmosphere).  The problem, however, is that the explanation may fit one set of data but not all the data. In the case of lead in the US, for example, “all proxies for lead increased dramatically from around 1910  through 1970.  If the lead hypothesis is correct, then crime should have displayed a measurable increase between 1925 and 1985” (p. 451). Unfortunately for the hypothesis, crime rates were much more varied than one would expect., Conclusion: Each of the 17 hypotheses that have been suggested as explanations for the crime drop was subjected to four separate empirical tests.  No explanation for the crime drop was fully consistent with the data. One explanation – that we now have improved security (e.g., to protect from thefts of and from vehicles) – fits the data for certain crimes but is less persuasive for others. Variation in the propensity to commit crime within a society appears to be better understood than changes in crime rates within a society across time., Reference: Farrell, Graham, Nick Tilley, and Andromachi Tseloni (2014).

Prison sentences punish more than just the person who is imprisoned: Children who experience the imprisonment of a parent are likely to suffer in a number of social and personal domains when they become young adults.,"It is estimated that more than half of American prison inmates have children and that about 1 in 43 American children have an incarcerated parent. There is a growing body of literature demonstrating the negative impact of imprisonment on the children of those imprisoned (e.g., Criminological Highlights 14(2)#1).  A substantial amount of this research focuses on the immediate effects on children.  This paper examines whether these negative effects are evident when the children who experienced the imprisonment of a parent reach adulthood., The study analyzed data collected as part of the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health between 1994 and 2008.  It used a statistical technique known as propensity score matching, where youths are given a score – in this case based on 20 variables – on their likelihood of having a parent incarcerated.  The variables used to create the measure of the likelihood of having an incarcerated parent included the youth’s race, economic situation, family structure, parental alcoholism or drug use, and neighbourhood disorder and safety. Youths who, as adolescents, had a parent who had been incarcerated at least once were matched with youths whose parents were not incarcerated but had the same likelihood of ending up in prison.  The circumstances of these children at age 18-24 and 26-34 were then examined on eight different measures., “Across different domains in early young adulthood [age 18-24], parental incarceration… is associated with greater levels of grown children’s offending, mental health problems (i.e., depression), and illegal drug use… In addition, children of incarcerated parents obtain less formal education and are more likely to cohabit [but not marry]” (p. 21). The size of some of these effects is not small: offending rates are about 26% higher for those who had experienced the incarceration of a parent.  These effects carry over to the later time period (when the youths were young adults, age 26-34).  In some cases (e.g., criminal offending) the effects of having experienced the incarceration of a parent were larger at this later stage of the young person’s life.  But in addition, when they were age 26-34, those who had experienced the incarceration of a parent were more likely to report problems with alcohol and lower annual earnings.  On average, those who had experienced the incarceration of a parent earned about three thousand dollars less per year., Other published work demonstrates that “parental incarceration… can adversely affect young children and does so along multiple life domains, including offending, health, and education…[These results suggest that] parental incarceration may constitute a turning point that exerts harmful effects during and after the transition into adulthood” (p. 24-5).  Obviously, the effect of parental incarceration may vary “depending on how frequently parents have been incarcerated, the duration of a parent’s incarceration… and whether children reside with their parents during the transition into adulthood” (p. 27)., Conclusion: It is clear that there are immediate and long-term harmful effects on the children of those who are incarcerated.  Incarceration “may harm children through distinct causal mechanisms [such as] less supervision of children, which in turn may result in lower school attendance, reduced emotional attachment and weakened social skills [along with] financial insecurity” (p. 26).  Although sentencing laws and practice do not normally explicitly take into account the harmful effects of imprisonment on the offspring of those being sentenced, findings such as these raise serious questions about the overall usefulness of incarceration in circumstances where other punishments could be imposed as alternatives., Reference: Mears, Daniel P., and Sonja E.

"Though there are not many well-executed studies of the benefits and costs of crime prevention programs, what data there are suggest some types of programs can be considered to pay for themselves.",", When a crime prevention program is shown to be effective, it is reasonable to ask a second question: Is the program worth its costs?   This paper examines only programs that have been evaluated using high quality experimental or quasi-experimental designs and have looked at both monetary benefits and costs.  Remarkably, there were only 23 studies that met these criteria., In thinking about the benefits of programs, one needs to consider that for certain types of programs – programs that attempt to ensure that youths have healthy early lives, for example – the benefits are almost certainly under-estimated if one looks only at the crime-related outcomes. Situational crime prevention programs, on the other hand, are likely to have benefits only in the area of reduced crime.  Some costs are relatively easy to estimate (imprisonment costs, for example) whereas others (e.g, the psychological costs to victims) are less straightforward.  A second problem in estimating benefits is that for some programs – programs aimed at parental child-rearing practices or other issues early in development – the crime-prevention benefits are not expected to be demonstrated until many years later.  Costly interventions in the lives of very young children, therefore, might not appear to be cost-effective in terms of crime prevention until many years later even though there may be more immediate benefits to the child.  A comprehensive study of an early developmental intervention program would ideally, therefore, evaluate not only a wide variety of crime reduction benefits, but also reductions in substance abuse and health costs, success in education and employment, and benefits to other family members. And it would follow the children for many years., Eleven studies of developmental prevention were examined. Interventions varied in length from 10 weeks to 6 years and typically involved a focus on ‘at risk’ children shortly after birth or in some cases when a woman found out she was pregnant. Seven studies had long follow-up periods (7-36 years).  All had high quality research designs.  For most of them, the benefits substantially exceeded costs.  Eight showed unambiguously favourable benefit-to-cost ratios. “Developmental prevention appears to be a highly promising strategy in reducing the monetary costs associated with delinquency and later criminal offending and improving the life-course development of at-risk children and their families” (p. 473)., Eight situational crime prevention programs were examined on such matters as improved lighting in high crime areas.  In six of them, there were favourable benefit-cost ratios, but the follow-up periods tended to be rather short.  In addition, they tend to be more likely to show positive effects on crime when implemented in high crime areas., Four high quality studies of community crime prevention were found. These interventions are “intended to change the social conditions that are believed to sustain crime in residential communities” (p. 484) and often attempt to intervene in ways that address specific issues within a given community.  These, too, tended to show favourable benefit-to-cost ratios., Conclusion: One advantage of developmental prevention is that its monetary benefits often go far beyond reduced crime. “On the basis of benefit-cost ratios, the most cost-beneficial developmental crime prevention programs include preschool intellectual enrichment and cognitive-behavioural treatment” (p. 490) both of which are likely to lead to long-term benefits far beyond simple crime reduction.  However, situational and community-based programs also have shown monetary benefits.  The most important lesson, perhaps, is that crime prevention programs need to be implemented in a fashion that allows for rigorous long-term evaluation.  The evaluation itself may be difficult and involve non-trivial investment of resources.  Without it, however, ineffective – or even harmful – programs are likely to continue to be implemented., Reference: Welsh, Brandon, David P.

It is not clear that wearing body cameras will reduce the use of force by police.,", Although police are authorized to use force against civilians in certain circumstances, incidents involving inappropriate or excessive police use of force that happened to be recorded have led to the suggestion that the police should be equipped with body worn cameras (BWC) as a way to reduce violent acts by and against the police.  The assumption appears to be that if police and citizens know that their actions will be recorded, their use of violence will decrease. The results of studies of BWCs are not, at this point, conclusive, though there is some evidence suggesting that they are effective in reducing police use of force on civilians (see, e.g., Criminological Highlights, 15(6)#8), These two papers report findings from 10 separate experiments in 6 jurisdictions, mostly, apparently, in the U.K.  Individual officers, on a given day, were randomly assigned to wear and use the BWC.  Other officers, on each shift, were assigned to the comparison (No BWC) group. The unfortunate aspect of this design is that officers were constantly aware of whether or not they were wearing the BWC on each shift and, equally importantly, were aware of the fact that they were participating in an experiment.  It undoubtedly would have been more ‘true life’ if BWCs had been made ‘permanently’ mandatory in some geographic areas and not others. If that had been done, officers would become accustomed to their new equipment. That design was, unfortunately, not used., Three different measures were used in assessing the value of BWC: (1) Reports by officers of any use of force beyond verbal commands during an arrest. (2) Reports by officers of assaults by citizens on them, and (3) Complaints against the police filed by citizens., Averaging across the 10 experiments, there was no overall impact on police use of force, as reported by police officers, in the shifts in which police had BWCs compared to those in which the BWCs were not used.  However, there was substantial variation across the sites, with 3 studies showing higher reporting of use of force during the control shifts and 7 showing more reports of police use of force when BWCs were worn.  Interestingly, police themselves in 8 jurisdictions reported higher rates of assaults on them by citizens when they were wearing a BWC than when they were not.   Finally, simply carrying out the study reduced dramatically the number of complaints filed against the police in all jurisdictions – though the complaints that were received were equally likely to relate to actions taken when officers were wearing BWCs as when they were not.    It would seem that the publicity surrounding the experiment changed either police behaviour, or citizens’ willingness or comfort in filing complaints, or both. The fact that the ‘complaint rate’ against officers wearing or not wearing BWCs was the same suggests that it is not the wearing of the BWC per se that is responsible for the apparent change in the rate at which complaints were lodged. ., Conclusion: Although the experiment carried out and reported here used ‘randomized’ procedures, it cannot be said that the results are conclusive.  The method whereby in a given week, a specific officer would sometimes wear a body-worn camera (BWC) and sometimes not means that the experiment was likely always to be a salient part of their thinking.  But in addition, the study relies, necessarily, on reports by the police as well as (in the second study) complaints by citizens, rather than any form of objective or disinterested assessment of police behaviour.  Thus, we have no way of knowing whether a reduction in complaints about the police – which, in this study, was not related to the wearing of BWCs – was because of improved police behaviour or because those who came in contact with the police and would, otherwise, have filed a complaint did not do so for fear that some aspect of their own behaviour (e.g., bad language directed at a police officer) would come under increased scrutiny.  On the basis of these two studies and others it seems premature to conclude that this equipment helps reduce the use of force by police., Reference: Ariel, Barak & 7 others (2016).

"Children and youths who are victimized are more likely, subsequently, to commit violent offences because the victimization experience increases the likelihood that they will anticipate positive feelings about their own violent offending and will decrease their anticipated feelings of shame.",", There is a substantial literature demonstrating that victims of violence are, themselves, more likely than non-victims to commit violent acts.  However, there is less evidence explaining why this relationship exists. This paper explores the hypothesis that “victims [of violence] become more attuned toward the benefits of violence perpetration than toward its costs” (p. 287)., The study uses longitudinal data from youths in Zurich, Switzerland, for four years starting from when the children were on average 11.3 years old. Various control measures (e.g., risky leisure activities, attitudes toward violence, self-control) were assessed when the child was 11., When the child was approximately 13 years old, violent victimization in the previous 12 months (e.g., robbery, sexual assault, assault) was assessed. In addition, they were given 3 short vignettes about violent interactions with a same sex child to assess how they thought they would feel if they, themselves,  acted violently.  One was as follows: “Imagine that another adolescent from your school comes up to you and says “Get lost, you idiot!” so loudly that others can hear it.  Refusing to take it, you punch the other adolescent right in the face.  She/he falls on the floor, her/his pants rip, and she/he begins to bleed heavily from her/his nose.  You yourself are unharmed. Other people are not involved.”  Youths were then asked whether they would feel good doing this, whether they would be ashamed of their behaviour, whether their friends would admire them, and whether they thought the other person would retaliate., Self-reports of “victimization [when the child was age 13 were] positively related to positive perceptions of violent action, including feeling good about violent behaviour and being admired by friends. In addition, victimization was negatively related to negative perceptions of violent action, including the perceived seriousness of violent behaviour, feeling ashamed with parents and friends, the perceived seriousness [of the violent acts] by friends, and the perceived risk of retaliation” (p. 293)., Two years later, when the youth was 15, they were asked about violence perpetration in the previous 12 months.  As was expected, prior victimization (measured at age 13) was positively related to offending at age 15.  The youths’ assessments (at age 13) of how they and others would feel if they committed violent acts were also related to reports of offending at age 15. For example, those who anticipated that their friends would admire them if they committed acts of violence reported committing more violence at age 15.   More important, however, was the fact that the strength of the initial relationship between victimization prior to age 13, and reported violent offending at age 15 decreased by about 38% when the mediating factors of how the youths thought they would feel about their own violence were included. Most notably, anticipating positive feelings about being violent appeared to account for a substantial amount of the victimization-offending relationship.  When these feelings about the consequences of offending were controlled for, the relationship between prior victimization and offending was no longer statistically significant., Conclusion: It was found that “being victimized influences people’s experience and appraisal of subsequent interpersonal conflict situations, which in turn influences the likelihood that they will engage in violent offending in these future situations…. More specifically, the results showed that prior victimization increases the likelihood that individuals anticipate positive feelings about violent offending while reducing feelings of shame…. [Furthermore] feeling good about violence increased the likelihood of engaging in violent offending….” (p. 300).  “The effect of victimization on later offending was partially mediated by an altered appraisal of violent situations” (p. 301)., Averdijk, Margit, Jean-Louis Van Gelder, Manuel Eisner, and Denis Ribeaud (2016).

Well-intentioned gang streetworker programs designed to help people move out of gangs are more likely to increase offending than to decrease it.,", Many levels of government invest scarce funds into programs that claim they will reduce offending, typically on the basis of testimonials or very persuasive sounding ‘case histories.’  The assumption appears to be that, at worst, these programs won’t work, and at best, they will help solve the crime problem.  The difficulty, as this study (as well as others – e.g., Criminological Highlights, 5(4)#1, 6(2)#4) demonstrates, is that well-intentioned programs can make things worse. Said differently, crime prevention programs can cause increases in crime., Gang streetworker programs have a long history.  A 1950s program in Boston in which seven professionally-trained streetworkers were directed “to contact, establish relations with, and attempt to change resident gangs” (p.7) showed no favourable impact when compared to gangs that had not been part of the program. A Chicago study in the 1960s did show some effects: “the greatest delinquency increases [recorded in the study] were experienced by youth who were served most intensively by their assigned streetworkers” (p. 7).  More recent studies show, at best, mixed results of similar gang intervention approaches, with one study carried out in Pittsburgh showing a “statistically significant increase in aggravated assaults and gun assaults in its targeted neighbourhoods” (p. 10).  One explanation for these results is that “the presence of streetworkers may have increased the cohesion of gangs, making some gangs more organized, in turn leading to increased violence” (p. 10)., In Boston, a streetworker program was started in 2009.  It “deployed 15 streetworkers to develop relationships with and serve members of the 20 treatment gangs. Most streetworkers were assigned to a single gang…” (p. 11).  Many of the streetworkers were former gang members who knew how gangs worked and were hired because of their specialized knowledge. The second strategy used in this program involved delivery of social services (e.g., life skills programs, education, employment opportunities) to treatment gang members., Since concern about gun violence was the main impetus for starting the program, serious gun violence trends involving treatment gangs were compared, in a quasi-experimental design, to serious gun violence for equivalent gangs that did not receive treatment. Three different approaches to matching treated and untreated gangs were used., If all one did is to look at changes within the gangs that were assigned a streetworker, it would seem that the treatment (gang streetworkers and providing services) was effective: shootings went down by 23%. However, the untreated gangs showed a 31% decrease in shootings. Compared to what would have happened with no intervention, then, it would seem that providing services increased the number of shootings beyond what would have happened without the intervention., Conclusion:  This program was implemented and monitored carefully.  Measurement of gun violence in the two groups was carried out in an equivalent manner. Hence the increase in violence associated with gang streetworkers needs to be taken seriously, especially given the rather mixed findings over the past 60 years of research on this approach to dealing with gang violence.  Although it is not known for certain why this ‘crime prevention’ program increased, rather than decreased, serious crime, it is thought that the intervention “may have strengthened gang identify and cohesion by its extensive use of group-based programming” (p. 15).  “Given the existing evidence base, jurisdictions suffering from gang violence problems should be advised to avoid implementing gang streetworker programs” (p. 17).  More generally the lesson is clear: it cannot be assumed that well-intentioned anti-crime treatments can do no harm., Reference: Braga, Anthony A. (2016) The continued importance of measuring potentially harmful impacts of crime prevention programs.  Journal of Experimental Criminology, 12, 1-20., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV16N2.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-16-no-2-%E2%80%93-march-2016,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 16, No. 2 – March 2016",Regular Issue,2016
Crafting and evaluating programs that contribute to the peaceful re-entry of prisoners into society need to be taken seriously.  Effective programs appear to be those that address directly the factors leading to offending in those most likely to reoffend.,", Even though thousands of sentenced prisoners are released each year from prisons (over 600,000 from state and federal prisons in the US in 2013 and about 10,000 in Canada serving sentences of a year or more), relatively little is done to help these former prisoners re-enter society as peaceful citizens, even though, at least in the US, public opinion polls suggest that the public supports the idea that public funds be invested in re-entry programs., The challenge for those dedicated to helping prisoners re-enter society “is to avoid the trap of developing programs that ultimately prove to be ineffective. In fact the … creation of numerous programs is far outstripping knowledge about what works in re-entry… and most programs are not evaluated” (p. 538).  A challenge, of course, is that it is sometimes assumed that because programs that address observable problems that former prisoners face (e.g., employment, housing) can be justified on humanitarian grounds, they will also  reduce re-offending. The data suggest that this cannot be assumed., The data that are available suggest that high risk former prisoners will benefit from more intensive and extensive services.  Low risk prisoners are unlikely to benefit from special services that might be provided to them. More generally, however, lack of integrity in program implementation – where those delivering services modify an existing program to fit what they think works – almost certainly ensures that even a program proven to be successful in previous studies will not be successful.  One program, (Criminological Highlights 9(2)#4) for example, was implemented in a manner that the intervention was clearly too brief to have a chance to be effective and had treatment groups that were at least twice as large as those that had been shown, in previous studies,  to be effective. Furthermore, it did not include a key component of the original designed program., An analysis of apparently effective re-entry programs suggests the following conclusions: (1) No single program is going to work for all ex-prisoners.  (2) The evidence even on effective programs is slim; hence evaluation of all programs needs to be integrated into any re-entry program. Multiple continuing evaluations need to be carried out, especially when a program is implemented in a new setting. (3) It is difficult to generalize about what might be effective to new settings or different kinds of prisoners., “The history of corrections instructs us that most programs fail, not only because they are poorly implemented but also because they were poorly conceived in the first place” (p. 552).  It is suggested that the focus of programs should be on “those deficits (‘criminogenic needs’) that increase the likelihood that [former prisoners] will recidivate… and [the focus should be] only on those causes of recidivism that can be changed” (p. 554)., Conclusion: The problem faced by those concerned with prisoner re-entry is that “re-entry programs are marked by a lack of a clear theoretical model and by a failure to specify which risk factors are being targeted and whether [these identified risk factors] are empirically established predictors of recidivism. In many instances, program advocates seem to rely on liberal common sense that doing something for [former prisoners]… will improve their lives and enable them to escape a life in crime. This intuition may not be fully incorrect, but it ignores the reality that interventions will likely fail or have only modest results when targeting weak predictors of recidivism or targeting them in the wrong way” (p. 555). “Good intentions may have disappointing results” (p. 564).  It turns out that in this area, as in many others, there is no good substitute for good data., Reference: Jonson, Cheryl Lero and Francis T. Cullen (2015).

"For some people who are found guilty in criminal courts, it is plausible that they could either receive a prison sentence or they could be given a community based sanction. A U.K. study found that after one year in the community, those who had been sent to prison were more likely to commit an offence.",", Though it is tempting to see incarceration as a way of reducing offending, existing data would suggest that those who are imprisoned rather than being given community sanctions are, if anything, more likely to reoffend (see The Effects of Imprisonment: Specific Deterrence and Collateral Effects). This study, carried out in the UK, compares the offending patterns of 1,162 people who were imprisoned with an equal number of comparable people who were given sentences involving community supervision., The challenge in carrying out studies of the effects of imprisonment on crime are many, but the largest problem is creating an equivalent non-imprisoned comparison group.  Although there have been some random or equivalent control trials (see Criminological Highlights 3(4)#4, 11(4)#2), clearly there are some people for whom equivalent comparators cannot be found (e.g., those whose offence almost automatically leads to a prison term and those whose offence almost never requires a prison term)., This study, then, uses ‘propensity score matching’ to identify equivalent pairs of male offenders who could have received either a prison sentence or a non-prison sentence.  Of the more than 5000 people for whom data were available, reasonably equivalent pairs (one of whom went to prison, the other getting a community sanction) were found for 2,324 of them.  Hence the study examines those who could have, under current practice, received either prison or a community sanction.  All 2,324 of them were supervised in the community – either as a sentence involving a community order, or after release from a prison sentence of at least one year. They were all followed for one year while being supervised in the community., Those who had been sentenced to prison were significantly more likely than those given a community supervision order to be convicted of an offence within one year of the start of their supervision in the community (51.1% vs. 44.5% were reconvicted).   Those who had previously been incarcerated were, as well, much more likely to be incarcerated as a result of their offence.  In addition, those who had been incarcerated who did reoffend committed their first offence sooner than did those who had been sentenced to a community supervision order., The sample was broken down into five groups that, roughly speaking, could be described in terms of their likelihood of being incarcerated at the time of their original sentencing.  Generally speaking, the differences between the imprisoned and the community sanction group were largest for those who, at the time of sentencing, were least likely to go to prison (e.g., those with the least serious offences and/or least serious criminal records). Said differently, prison seemed to have the largest negative impacts on those who were the most likely candidates for a sentence involving community supervision., Conclusion: “The results of this research add to the growing evidence base [suggesting] that the experience of prison can be criminogenic” (p. 1072). In this study, being sent to prison “was associated with a small but significant increase in the proportion of people reoffending… and a substantial increase in the proportion of individuals being incarcerated…. [These findings are] strikingly similar to others found in England, the US, the Netherlands, and Switzerland” (p. 1070)., Reference: Jolliffe, Darrick and Carol Hedderman (2015).  Investigating the Impact of Custody on Reoffending Using Propensity Score Matching. Crime and Delinquency,  61(8), 1051-1077., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV16N2.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-16-no-2-%E2%80%93-march-2016,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 16, No. 2 – March 2016",Regular Issue,2016
"Two long-term childhood psychosocial interventions into the lives of 7 year olds showed almost no positive effects on delinquency, substance abuse, and antisocial behaviour when the children were 13-15 years old, even though the programs had previously been evaluated by their designers.",", There is an increasing amount of evidence that “preventative action aimed at reducing risk factors and promoting protective factors during infancy and childhood can reduce the likelihood of later crime…. Among the most promising approaches are programs that target parenting skills and/or promote social and emotional skills during childhood” (p. 22)., This study examined two programs: “Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies” (PATHS) and the parenting program “Triple P.”  The PATHS program is designed to “enhance affective, cognitive, and social competencies, and reduce aggression and behaviour problems in primary school-age children” (p. 24). Triple-P, on the other hand, is “a multilevel parent training program based on cognitive-behavioural therapy” (p. 24)., The programs were implemented as universal, population-level programs, rather than for particular subgroups of ‘at risk’ children, on the theory that all families and children could benefit from the programs.  The programs were evaluated in 56 schools in Zurich, Switzerland.  14 sets of four similar schools were identified and then each school in a set was assigned to one of four conditions: A control condition, where neither program was implemented, schools that received the PATHS program only, schools that received the Triple-P program only, and schools that received both programs. In all, 14 schools were assigned to each of the four treatment or control conditions.  Various outcome measures were used when the children were 13 and 15 including, among other things, self-reported delinquency, teacher reported deviance, self-reported contacts with the police, substance use, prosocial behaviour, and non-aggressive conduct disorder., In all, looking across the two programs, there were 52 separate effects reported (26 at age 13 and 26 at age 15).  “The present study found practically no evidence for long-term intervention effects” (p. 41).  The effects that were found were inconsistent across time, and across apparently similar measures.  Furthermore, some were in the opposite direction from what would be expected., One reason for the lack of effect may be that this was a universal program rather than an intensive program targeting particular (e.g., at-risk) children; therefore it might have little impact on children and families not ‘at risk’. Furthermore, the Triple-P program involved only four sessions of 2-2.5 hours each, and only 27% of the parents attended even one session. Only 19% of all parents attended all of the 4 sessions, notwithstanding the fact that the program was apparently delivered as it was designed to be.  The PATHS program was delivered in the normal classrooms, 2-3 times a week for a total of about 67 minutes per week., Conclusion: Various explanations might be offered for the failure of the two programs to show favourable effects. One possibility is that they were universal rather than targeted programs and simply aren’t powerful enough to show strong effects, especially since the attendance rate of parents was rather low in one program. Alternatively, it could be that – notwithstanding favourable impacts reported by those who developed the programs – the programs simply aren’t effective when implemented by those who are committed to following a curriculum and have no financial or intellectual interest in the outcome.  It could be that these programs are not effective in school settings where other educational and behavioural programs are already part of the curriculum as they were in Zurich. Finally, it could be that “it simply is not realistic to expect a long-term effect of these programs on later delinquency and problem behaviour” (p. 42).  There was one important benefit, however: by allowing a high quality independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the programs, the Zurich school system determined that two program that had ‘promise’ did not work in that setting., Reference: Averdijk, Jan Zirk-Sadopwski, Denis Ribeaud, and Manuel Eisner (2016).

Allowing people with criminal records to work in jobs that are presumptively restricted to those without criminal records reduces the likelihood that they will re-offend.,"There is a substantial amount of information suggesting that people with criminal records have a difficult time getting employment and housing. Obtaining employment is one of the reasons that people attempt to have their criminal records suppressed (Criminological Highlights 6(3)#2, 15(3)#5, 15(2)#6, 16(3)#2).  This paper examines the question of whether allowing people to avoid the negative impact of a criminal record on obtaining employment reduces subsequent re-offending., Specifically, the paper examines the impact of waiving a normal prohibition against hiring people with criminal records (i.e., arrests or convictions). It focuses on a specific type of employment in which many job applicants have criminal records: Low wage jobs in the health care industry for which people do not need a specific license (such as those required of doctors or nurses), but do have contact with patients.  These were generally unskilled jobs in facilities such as nursing homes, assisted living residences, etc.  71% of the applicants were women; 50% were Black., The criminal background check for those wishing to be employed in these jobs in New York State involved a two stage process. A person could apply for the position, and then, if they had no record (only 48% of all applicants), they would be cleared for the job.  Alternatively, a person with a record would normally be initially and tentatively denied the position, but would be invited to provide evidence of rehabilitation to reverse the proposed denial.  “About 59% of those with criminal records did submit evidence of rehabilitation.  52% of those who submitted evidence of rehabilitation were cleared for employment. Those who had criminal records but did not submit evidence of rehabilitation were automatically denied the possibility of employment., Information on criminal justice involvement of all job applicants was collected for the 3 years after the application was submitted.  Only about 9% of the job applicants with criminal records reoffended, though this rate was, not surprisingly, considerably higher for men than for women (approximately 11.2% for men and 7.1% for women).  Older job applicants were less likely to reoffend., There was a 4% reduction in reoffending over the 3-year period for those cleared for work. In the context of a reoffending rate of around 10%, this reduction is obviously quite substantial.    Given their higher base rate of offending, it is not surprising that the beneficial effect of being cleared for work was larger for men than for women.  There was essentially no impact on being cleared for work for older women, a finding that also isn’t surprising, given that they had low reoffending rates overall, whether cleared for employment or not., Most, but not all, of those cleared for work did, in fact, get jobs.  It appears that the large reduction in reoffending by men who were cleared for employment “can be explained by increased employment opportunities in the health-care industry that would otherwise be unavailable” (p. 196)., Conclusion: Enabling those with criminal records to obtain employment that would otherwise be unavailable to them appears to reduce subsequent offending.  The job applicants in this study were, on average, about 39 years old.  Previous research (Criminological Highlights 4(3)#6) has suggested that employment for those over age 27 is particularly likely to reduce reoffending.  It would appear that there are advantages to both those who have offended and society more generally to reducing the barriers to employment for those once arrested or convicted., Reference: Denver, Megan, Garima Siwach, and Shawn D.

The use of force by New York City police officers against Black suspects in stop-and-frisk operations increased immediately after two fatal shootings of police officers by Black suspects.,", Explanations that are offered for police use of force against civilians usually relate to characteristics (including race) or behaviour of the civilian or characteristics of the police officer involved., In contrast, this study suggests that “racial bias in policing and discrimination more broadly is not static but fluctuates, partly driven by significant events that provoke intergroup conflict and foreground racial stereotypes” (p. 380). This paper looks at police use of ‘ordinary’ force against citizens during the two week period before and after two New York City (NYC) police officers were killed by Black suspects. In addition, the use of force was measured before and after two other incidents in which NYC police officers were killed by Hispanic and White suspects. During the period that the data were examined for this study (2006-2012) Blacks were estimated to be about 25% of the population of NYC, but were the subject of about 54% of the recorded stop-and-frisk operations., Two police officers were shot and killed by Black suspects in July 2007 and in December 2011.  In March 2007 and in March 2011, police officers were shot by a white and a Hispanic suspect, respectively.  “Use of force” by police officers during stop-and-frisk operations was estimated from the data on the NYC police stop-and-frisk report form.   Various forms of physical force were listed on the form.  This study coded any use of force (“Hands on Suspect” or more) as use of force.  For Blacks, 22% of the stops involved this level of force; for Hispanics it was 24%; for Whites it was 16%., Comparisons were made on police use of force in stops in roughly the same location and at approximately the same time of day three days before and three days after each of the killings of police officers.   The data show that there was “increased use of physical force by police officers against Blacks substantially in the three days after the shooting” (p. 395).  Use of force by the police against Black NYC residents subject to stop-and-frisk increased from 21.9% before the killing of the white police officer to 25.4% after the 2011 event.  For the 2007 event, police use of force against Blacks increased from 22% (before) to 25% (after)., The use of force against White and Hispanic suspects did not change from the period before to the period after the killing of the White police officer by the Black suspect.  Furthermore, “the two [killings of White police officers] involving a Hispanic and White suspect did not increase the use of force against any of the groups” (p. 397)., Detailed daily estimates on the use of force demonstrated an immediate increase the day after the killing of a police officer by a Black suspect, and then a fairly rapid decline such that within about 2 weeks, the rate of use of force had returned to its previous levels., Conclusion:  The findings suggest that racial bias in policing is not static. Its rate is “partly driven by significant events that provoke intergroup conflict and foreground racial stereotypes….  Extreme violence against police officers can lead to periods of substantially increased racial disparities in the use of police force” (p. 410).   The findings suggest that “local events create intergroup conflict, foreground stereotypes, and trigger discriminatory responses.  From this perspective, discriminatory behaviour arises not only from static conditions but also from temporal sequences of events and responses” (p. 410)., Reference: Legewie, Joscha (2016).  Racial Profiling and Use of Force in Police Stops: How Local Events Trigger Periods of Increased Discrimination.  American Journal of Sociology, 122(2), 379-424., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV16N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-16-no-5-%E2%80%93-july-2016,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 16, No. 5 – July 2016",Regular Issue,2016
An Australian study demonstrates that ordinary citizens who are intimately aware of the details of a specific criminal case are much more likely to agree with the sentence handed down by the court than public opinion surveys would suggest.,", Research in many countries suggests that ordinary citizens believe that sentences handed down in criminal courts are too lenient.  The irony of this view, of course, is that few people have enough detailed information about criminal cases to evaluate whether the ‘sentence fits the crime.’  They typically have little information about the details of the crime or about the offender., Previous research, including one prior Australian study (Criminological Highlights, 11(6)#2, 14(1)#6), has found that jurors who have found an accused guilty are much more content with the sentence handed down in the case they heard than public opinion surveys would suggest.  Indeed, in many cases, jurors’ preferred sentences were more lenient than that imposed by the judge.   Jurors, as representatives of the public at large, then, do not differ much from judges in their views of appropriate sentences., This study, replicating the earlier Australian study, was carried out in the state of Victoria. It used data from 987 jurors who served on juries in 124 trials.   Most of the principal offences for which the accused was found guilty were sex offences (39%) or violent offences (32%).  Jurors were invited by the trial judge to participate in the study in trials where a guilty verdict was returned but before the offender had been sentenced.  Those who voluntarily participated were then asked if they would be willing to participate in a second survey (after the judge had sentenced the offender)., For 62% of the jurors, the preferred sentence – suggested by the jurors before the offender was actually sentenced – was more lenient than the sentence that was subsequently imposed by the judge. In 2% it was the same and for 36% of the jurors their preferred sentence was more severe than the sentence imposed by the judge. Not surprisingly, the jurors who filled out the follow-up questionnaire thought that the judge’s sentence was either very appropriate (55%) or fairly appropriate (32%).  In cases where offenders were sentenced to prison, jurors who thought a prison sentence was appropriate recommended a prison sentence that was, on average, 12 months shorter than that imposed by the judge., The exception to this general finding was that for sex crimes, jurors tended to equally split between those who wanted a more lenient and those who wanted a harsher sentence than that imposed by the judge. In particular, jurors tended to be harsher than judges for sex offences involving victims under 12 years old.   This effect was similar to that found in the earlier Australian study., When asked about sentences generally, however, the results were quite different.  These jurors thought that sentences in their state were, on average, too lenient for all categories of offences., Conclusion: The method used in this study – asking jurors about their views of the sentence they thought should be imposed in the case they heard – “confirms earlier findings suggesting that top-of-the-head surveys showing dissatisfaction about judicial leniency cannot be taken at face value and reveal that the community is not as uniformly punitive as polls suggest” (p. 198).   Jurors, it seems, are quite happy to give their views of what should happen to the person they just found guilty and a substantial portion of them are willing to give their views of the judge’s sentence when it was handed down. They generally are fairly content with actual sentences in the case they heard.  Interestingly, however, jurors do not appear to generalize from their own experiences to sentences across the board: they still believed that most sentences are too lenient., Reference: Warner, Kate, Julia Davis, Caroline Spiranovic, Helen Cockburn, and Arie Freiberg (2017).  Measuring Jurors’ Views on Sentencing: Results from the Second Australian Jury Sentencing Study.  Punishment & Society, 19(2), 180-202., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV16N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-16-no-5-%E2%80%93-july-2016,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 16, No. 5 – July 2016",Regular Issue,2016
"What determines whether prisoners see the resolution of a dispute as legitimate?  It is not the outcome of the dispute. Rather, it is whether the correctional officer is seen as acting in a procedurally fair manner.",", It is believed that “when individuals believe authorities are legitimate, they are more likely to accept and comply with the decisions of those authorities regardless of their self-interests…. If individuals view authorities as illegitimate, then they may be more likely to become defiant or disrespectful toward authorities, which could be linked to noncompliance” (p. 683). Said differently, the legitimacy of those in power in institutions like prisons is important for the peaceful operation of the institution., This paper examines the determinants of 5,616 prisoners’ views of correctional officers’ legitimacy in 46 correctional facilities in two US states. The prisoners had all served at least 6 months in the facility. A subset of 1,856 of these prisoners reported they had been confronted by correctional officers who alleged they had violated a prison rule.   These prisoners were asked questions about two aspects of this dispute: (1) The favourability of the outcome. This was measured with four questions related to such factors as whether the outcome of the dispute was better, the same as, or worse than the prisoner expected.  Prisoners were also asked (2) whether the correctional staff showed ‘procedural justice’ in dealing with the dispute by such actions as being polite and honest, showing concern for the prisoner’s rights, using fair investigatory procedures, and giving the prisoners a chance to give their side of the story.  The focus of the study was the extent to which these two measures related to the prisoners’ views of correctional officers, generally, as fair, doing a good job, and treating prisoners equally., Looking first at all inmates (those who had and had not been confronted for a rule violation), the study found that those confronted by correctional staff for a rule violation were, not surprisingly, less likely to see correctional officers as generally acting legitimately. This finding held even after 15 other variables (including various characteristics of the prisoner, such as race or whether they were gang members) were controlled for., More important was the finding –  looking only at those prisoners who had been confronted for a rule violation – that those who thought their own dispute was resolved favourably were no more likely to view correctional officers as generally acting legitimately than those who thought the correctional officer resolved the dispute in a manner that was not in their favour., What was important for prisoners’ views of correctional officer legitimacy was whether they felt that the dispute had been handled in a legitimate, procedurally fair manner.  In other words, “an instrumental perspective on prison discipline that [suggests that prisoners] who receive more favourable outcomes will be more likely to view correctional officers as legitimate” (p. 699) was not supported by this study.  Instead, it was found that prisoners, like everyone else, thought it important they were treated fairly and respectfully; this fair, respectful treatment led to the view that officers were doing a good job., Conclusion: This study found that prisoners who “perceive the outcomes and treatment they received during their encounters with correctional officers as more fair will, in turn, hold stronger beliefs regarding the legitimacy of those officers” (p. 699).  This is important, in part, because “correctional officer legitimacy has… been associated with the stability and predictability of prison environments.
Such environments are more likely to facilitate inmate well-being” (p. 698).  In other words, procedural fairness is important for “improving the safety and well-being of inmates and staff, and also for facilitating behavioural change among inmates” (p. 698)., Reference: Steiner, Benjamin and John Wooldredge (2015).  Examining the Sources of Correctional Officer Legitimacy.  Journal of Criminal Law & Criminology, 105(3), 679-704., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV16N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-16-no-5-%E2%80%93-july-2016,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 16, No. 5 – July 2016",Regular Issue,2016
Major events in large Canadian cities may be less likely to result in disorder and arrests of large numbers of citizens if coherent and comprehensive legal frameworks are developed before the events take place.,", A number of reviews have been carried out of disruptions at large events such as the G20 meeting in Toronto in 2010. These events are sometimes seen as ‘policing failures.’  This paper explores potentially controversy-attracting events and suggests, instead, that attention should be focused, initially, on the complex legal frameworks in which they take place., This paper takes what is known about the policing problems uncovered after the disruptions at the Toronto G20 meetings and explores what could be learned from a very different event: the winter Olympics in Vancouver in the same year. One symptom of the problem in Toronto is that 1,105 people were arrested in connection with protests at the G20; however, only 117 were ever found guilty of anything., Among other challenges facing those in charge of making arrangements for the G20 was the fact that Toronto had only 4 months to plan and implement procedures. Four concerns had to be simultaneously addressed: security for the event itself, management of vehicle and pedestrian traffic for those in Toronto, facilitation of collective expression, and law enforcement (e.g., apprehension of violent or destructive people, whether politically motivated or otherwise)., The problem with relying on common law power of the police to “preserve the peace” is that it does not define the limits of what can be done, and in specific circumstances the common law does not define, even geographically, where ‘special’ powers might appropriately be exercised.  Thus, for example, it provides no help on defining where the public can be excluded from normally public spaces.  Hence when three different degrees of restrictions were placed on parts of Toronto, there was no clear authority for doing this., The Toronto G20 also suffered from the fact that there was “inter-agency confusion regarding police powers” (p 197).   The Toronto Police Service, for example, was uncertain of its authority to construct security perimeters. In contrast, the Ontario Provincial Police believed their exclusion zones around the G8 meetings in Huntsville, Ontario (which took place immediately before the G20) were justified by the common law.   A little-used provincial law was resurrected to accomplish this without publicity, making it impossible for members of the public to obey a regulation that almost nobody knew about.  More generally, lines of authority were never clear among the various quite independent federal, provincial, and municipal police authorities.  Describing the inter-agency problems as a ‘failure of communication’ is an understatement, since it was not clear what was to be communicated or by whom., In contrast, in Vancouver, planning for the Olympics was comprehensive and carefully thought out. Public debate, long before the event, was sparked by proposals concerning the restrictions on public access (for protest/demonstration purposes).  Legal gaps were filled with a provincial law and a municipal bylaw (which was subsequently amended to address certain concerns); jurisdictional issues relating to the two police services involved were worked out far in advance.  Debate largely occurred before, rather than during the events in large part because all issues were in the open in Vancouver. This was not the case in Toronto., Conclusion: If the legal structure governing behaviour in large public events is properly structured, citizens and policing authorities will know how the event will be managed. In that way, management of these events can be structured so as to minimize the likelihood that police-citizen relationships are destabilized and individual rights threatened. Prior to the event, then, the authority of the various police services needs to be clarified, and concerns about balancing of interests need to be addressed explicitly., Reference: Pue, W.

Youths charged with offences in late adolescence and then transferred to adult court are likely to earn less money when they reach their early 20s in large part because they have spent considerably more time in custody than youths who remained in youth court.,", There is a substantial amount of information supporting the conclusion that transfers of youths accused of committing crimes to adult court do not have specific or general deterrent impacts (Criminological Highlights, 1(3)#2,  1(5)#5,  3(5)#5,  6(6)#2,  8(4)#7). More generally, transfers do not reduce subsequent offending.  These two papers examine whether transferring youths to adult court has an impact on educational attainment and income., Both papers use data from the “Pathways to Desistance” project that followed youths for seven years after they were found guilty of serious offences when they were 14-17 years old.  The project was carried out in two locations: Philadelphia and Phoenix. The study by S (see references) looked at males and females from both cities.  The A&L study looked only at males from Phoenix.  Each used ‘propensity score matching’ in an effort to equate youths who were transferred or to those dealt with in juvenile court.  The exact methods of matching varied somewhat, as did the statistical analyses.  Given the similarity of the results across studies, these differences indicate that the results are not a result of a particular operationalization of the constructs., Both papers examine the impact of transfers on the educational prospects and on employment or earnings of the youths.  The S study used a composite measure for employment (including hours worked and income earned) during the first four years after the decision on where the case would be heard or the full seven years.  The A&L study, in contrast, looked at average hourly wage and average hours worked during years 6 and 7 (at the end of the follow-up period only)., Taken together, the two studies suggest that the overall educational attainment of those transferred and those allowed to remain in juvenile court were similar, though the transferred youths were more likely to receive a high school equivalency rather than a high school diploma.   On income, the A&L study suggests that, in years 6 and 7, the youths who were transferred made less money.  This, however,  is apparently because the transferred sample spent, on average, a higher proportion of those two years out of the community (i.e., in custody) compared to the youths adjudicated in youth court.  Indeed, the S study, which looked at the 7 year follow-up period as a whole, found that youths who were transferred did, in fact, fare worse on employment outcomes.  However, when time in the community was adequately controlled for, there was no overall effect of the court in which the youths were adjudicated.   This was true for both the 4-year and the 7-year follow-up periods., Conclusion: Taken together, these studies suggest that there probably is not an overall impact of transfer to adult court on the level of educational attainment, but transfer clearly does impede the ability of young adults to earn a living, in large part because youths transferred to adult court spend more time incarcerated and less time in the community.  One limitation of these studies is that they followed the youths only until they were in their early 20s.   Nevertheless, given the known lack of deterrent value of juvenile transfers and the harmful impacts of imprisonment (on youths and adults), the two studies raise serious questions about the value of juvenile transfers., References: Sharlein, Jeffrey (2016).  Beyond Recidivism: Investigating Comparative Educational and Employment Outcomes for Adolescents in the Juvenile and Criminal Justice Systems.  Crime & Delinquency (Advanced availability, 2017).  Augustyn, Megan Bears and Thomas A.

"A carefully constructed assessment tool for predicting the likelihood of repeat spousal violence is more accurate than police investigators’ predictions. Nevertheless, for those men predicted by this assessment tool to have a high likelihood of future violence, the prediction was wrong in about 80% of the cases: most men did not reoffend.",", In responding to cases of intimate partner violence (IPV), police often decide on what actions to take based on their predictions about what the perpetrator might do in the future.  Hence, there is appetite for a measure that quickly and easily can help in making a decision as to whether to warn, charge, or arrest and remove someone apparently involved in IPV., Previous research (e.g., Criminological Highlights 3(2)#7) has suggested that predictions of future IPV are often inaccurate. This paper investigates the accuracy of a prediction measure developed in cooperation with the police in Israel.   Among other goals, the study investigated the relative accuracy of police investigators’ predictions of future violent behaviour on the part of those apprehended for IPV.  Two general outcome variables were used: any general complaint to the police about the IPV suspect and complaints involving physical violence., In order to be useful for police, a predictive instrument has to be relatively easy and fast to administer.  But more importantly, it has to be based on information that is readily available in most cases.   In this case, the final version of the prediction instrument consisted of 45 items related to the offence and the offender.  All were to be answered as “yes” or “no”.   The ‘critical’ items (e.g., “Are there signs of severe bodily injuries on the complainant?” or “Was she raped?”) were given much higher weights in the final score than the ‘moderate’ items (e.g., “Did the perpetrator pressure the complainant to cancel her complaint?”).   IPV “experts” divided the total scores on the prediction instrument into three risk categories., Police officers responding to 1,133 IPV cases then gathered the information necessary to calculate a prediction score.  In addition, police investigators themselves made subjective predictions concerning the future behaviour of the suspect.  They were not given the final prediction score, but obviously were very aware of the data that went into calculating it since they gathered it., For a period averaging 26 months, police records were monitored for repeat offending of the 1,133 suspects in the study.  Two types of offending were noted:  General complaints from the victim (e.g., harassment, threats, damage to property, violation of court protection orders, etc.) and physical violence or murder threats., The police officers’ assessment was that about 20% of the IPV suspects were high risk for reoffending.  However, their subjective risk assessments did not predict future behaviour on the part of the suspect.  About 17.5% of the suspects were, in fact, the subjects of general complaints and about 13.6% were the subjects of complaints about violence. But the investigator’s assessment had no value in predicting future behaviour.  The statistical scale did somewhat better. 6.2% of those rated as ‘low risk’ on the scale were re-involved with the police for physical violence compared to 16% of those whose scale value put them at ‘high risk’. The findings for ‘general complaints’ were similar., Conclusion: Though this assessment tool showed statistically significant predictive value of IPV, one needs to look carefully at the results to see the limitations.  748 people were assessed to be ‘high risk’ by the scale, but only 120 of them in fact were brought to police attention for physical violence and only 153 for ‘general complaints.’  The lesson is clear, and not unusual: Even though a measure predicts future behaviour to a ‘statistically significant’ degree, that doesn’t mean it will do a very good job.  In this case, the vast majority of those who were predicted to be ‘high risk’ for IPV showed no subsequent abusive behaviour toward the original complainant., Reference: Dayan, Kobi, Shaul Fox, and Michal Morag (2013).  Validation of Spouse Violence Risk Assessment Inventory for Police Purposes.  Journal of Family Violence, 28, 811-821., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV16N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-16-no-5-%E2%80%93-july-2016,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 16, No. 5 – July 2016",Regular Issue,2016
"One “dirty little secret of deterrence research” (p. 86) is that people do not estimate the likelihood of apprehension the way “rational actor” or other theories predict they should.  Sanction risk perceptions, instead, seem to be both imprecise and, in some instances, “produce logical inconsistencies fundamental enough to violate the laws of probability” (p. 103).",", Though the likelihood of offending may be related, to some extent, to the perceived certainty of punishment, this assertion ignores the determinants of the perception of apprehension.  Simply put, people may not be very good at processing information that is relevant to assessing their likelihood of being apprehended for an offence.  Previous research has demonstrated that perceived likelihood of apprehension and actual likelihood of apprehension are quite independent of one another., In this study, a series of experiments was carried out with online volunteers to see how they estimate probabilities of apprehension.  For example, objectively, the more detailed a hypothetical situation is, the less likely it is to occur because its occurrence requires all of the details to occur.  In one study people were randomly assigned to three conditions, two of which were: (a) “Please think about drivers in your city/town. If a typical driver decided to drive drunk on a Saturday night, what is the PERCENT CHANCE that he or she would be ARRESTED by the POLICE?” (b) “Please think about drivers in your city/town. If a typical driver decided to drive drunk on a Saturday night, what is the PERCENT CHANCE that he or she would run a STOP SIGN, cause a CAR ACCIDENT, and be ARRESTED by the POLICE?”  The second is, objectively, less likely because all three events must occur rather than just the one.  In fact, people’s estimate were quite similar (32% and 29%, respectively., In another study, testing the “anchoring” effect of information, respondents were given one of two versions (using either the higher or lower numbers) of the following scenario:  “Suppose that you drive to a new restaurant. When you go to leave the parking lot, you accidentally hit another car, badly damaging its back end. There are a few people in the parking lot, but none are close by. If you decided to just DRIVE AWAY without taking any other action, do you think your PERCENT CHANCE of getting CAUGHT by the POLICE would be higher than [19%, 79%], or lower than [19%, 79%]?” (Half of the participants received “19%” the other half received “79%”).  They were then asked “Now thinking about the last question, what specifically is the PERCENT CHANCE that you would be CAUGHT by the POLICE if you drove away?”  Those whose initial anchor was high (79%) estimated that their precise likelihood was 49%; those whose initial anchor was low (19%) estimated that their likelihood was only 32%.  It would seem that their responses were ‘anchored’ by the information in the question., Conclusions:  The results of a number of experiments (only two of which are described here) in which people made probabilistic estimates of the likelihood of certain events occurring or of their own behaviour suggest that people’s estimates of what they would do, or their likelihood of apprehension for certain offences, does not necessarily follow simple rules concerning probabilities.  These studies suggest that objective probability may be less important than deterrence theorists would suggest.  Attempts, therefore, to reduce crime by manipulating perceived sanction risk might want to look far beyond objective risk and consider the factors that actually affect the way in which people estimate the likelihood that they will be apprehended., Reference:  Pogarsky, Greg, Sean Patrick Roche, and Justin Pickett (2017).  Heuristics and Biases, Rational Choice, and Sanction Perceptions.  Criminology, 55(1) 85-111., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV16N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-16-no-5-%E2%80%93-july-2016,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 16, No. 5 – July 2016",Regular Issue,2016
Guns used by gangs in Chicago are largely imported from other states and tend to have had a number of previous owners.,"Cities with high homicide rates tend to focus their attention on trying to control access to firearms since a large proportion of homicides, in many locations, are carried out with firearms. In the US, 68% of homicides were carried out with firearms. In Chicago, where this study took place, about 80% of homicides involve firearms.  The comparable figure for Canada is 31%., Controlling gun availability is often seen as an effective – or perhaps the major – method of lowering the rate of firearms injuries and deaths.  However, to control availability, one needs to understand where the firearms involved in injuries and deaths come from.   This study uses information about the original purchasers of firearms confiscated by the police from Chicago gang members.  Guns on the street, in Chicago, are apparently much more expensive to obtain than the same gun from gun dealers, reflecting, presumably, the relative difficulty in obtaining guns illegally.  New guns in the US are almost exclusively sold by licensed firearms dealers who typically need to be able to identify the purchaser and determine that the person is not disqualified from owning the firearm.  However, private transactions after that initial purchase are less well regulated, or are not regulated at all.  A survey of US prison inmates, for example, suggested that the main sources of firearms (73%) for them were friends, family, or purchases on the street none of which involved questions about the qualifications of the purchaser.   Few firearms came from retail stories (12%) or other sources (14%)., When a firearm was confiscated by the Chicago police between 2009-2013, a request was made to a federal agency for a trace of its origins.  64% of the 8410 requests were successful.  Although the gang members themselves were young, the guns they were caught with were old – an average 11.6 years had elapsed between the initial purchase and the confiscation. Only 10% of the guns confiscated from gang members were less than 2 years old.  Very few (7.8%) of those who had possession of the firearm were the original (registered) owner. Many (about 20% of those where the gender of the purchaser could be identified) of the guns confiscated from male gang members were purchased by women., Illinois has, for many decades, required a background check on purchasers of firearms from gun dealers.  This was not the case for many states, particularly those in the deep south.  In 1994, however, all US gun dealers were required to do a background check. Prior to this change, it seemed that many (35%) of the guns recovered in Chicago came from the deep south, presumably because of the ease in purchasing them there. After gun dealers in the deep south were required to examine purchasers, the proportion of Chicago guns recovered by the police that originated in the south dropped to 15%.  Gun dealers themselves, through direct sales to gang members, do not appear to be an important source of gang guns:  “Direct, well-documented sales of guns by dealers to gang members account for less than 2% of the total [of guns recovered by the police]” (p. 723). “Most guns taken from gang members in Chicago pass through the hands of at least one intermediary – a third party that helped the gun move from dealer to gang member” (p. 725). Indeed, “trafficking is more common for guns that wind up confiscated from gang members than non-gang members” (p. 753)., Conclusion: It may be that gang members who are responsible for shootings in Chicago have relatively easy access to guns.  But these guns have been around for more than 10 years after they were first sold. Even though there are widely reported preferences for new guns (and guns on the street seem to cost more than guns bought from dealers), the fact that ‘gang guns’ tend to be old suggests that the underground market in guns is not as efficient as the legal market.  Said differently, in a location where there is relatively little control on firearms, regulation and enforcement does seem to restrict somewhat the access to the most preferred guns., Reference: Cook, Philip J., Richard J.

"Policing strategies that focus on local forms of disorder can be reduce crime. However, aggressive order maintenance strategies that target individual disorderly behaviours appear to be ineffective.",", Dealing with physical and social disorder appears to be a central feature of some police services’ crime prevention strategies.  Whether such strategies are effective, however, is contentious (Criminological Highlights 1(4)#5, 4(5)#4, 5(1)#6. 8(4)#1, 8(5)#8, 9(1)#2, 10(3)#4, 14(5)#3), in part because the strategies used and the problems that are targeted vary considerably., In this paper, a very thorough search of the published and unpublished research literature on the policing of disorder took place. All adequately designed studies addressing the question of whether policing disorder reduces crime were examined.  To be included in the review, there had to be some kind of ‘control areas’ within the cities. Hence in all cases, the disorder-oriented police strategy was compared to a control area where, typically, policing took place in its normal fashion.  Twenty-eight studies reporting 30 independent tests of policing disorder interventions were found. Two studies were from the U.K.; the rest were carried out in the U.S.  In 9 of the studies, a random, controlled, experimental design was used. In the rest, an attempt was made to find equivalent areas in which the intervention did not take place., Across all 30 tests, there was a significant effect of police interventions.  Those areas in which social and/or physical disorder was targeted tended to have statistically significantly lower crime rates. However, the effect is described as ‘modest.’  To get an idea of what ‘modest’ means, imagine that in a targeted area, there were, on average 50 criminal incidents a month prior to the intervention being instituted, and that this varied such that for most (95%) of the months we would expect to find  between 40 and 60 incidents.  The targeted police interventions described in these 30 studies would be expected to reduce the number from 50 to approximately 48.85 incidents., However, only the community problem solving programs instituted by the police demonstrated significant crime reduction.  Using the hypothetical example above, these programs would be expected to reduce the number of crimes from 50 to 48.6 crimes per month., Those programs that attempted to carry out ‘aggressive order maintenance’ programs (e.g., focusing on minor forms of disorder such as public drunkenness, prostitution, vandalism, disorderly youth, or traditional arresting of those thought to be gang members) did not show statistically significant effects., The effective types of programs seem to have had fairly similar impacts on violent crime, property crime, and disorder and drug offences., Conclusion:  Policing that focuses on “community problem-solving that seeks to change social and physical disorder conditions at particular places produces [statistically] significant crime reductions” (p. 581) though these effects are relatively modest in size.  “When considering a policing disorder approach, police departments should adopt a ‘community coproduction model’ rather than drift toward a zero-tolerance policing model, which focuses on a subset of social incivilities….” (p. 581). This latter approach appears to be ineffective., Referernce: Braga, Anthony A., Brandon C. Welsh, and Cory Schnell (2015). Can Policing Disorder Reduce Crime? A Systematic Review and Meta-analylsis.

"A comprehensive employment assistance program for prisoners returning to the community reduced re-arrest, but not re-imprisonment.",", Most of those who enter prisons eventually are released. Unfortunately, however, even those who are skilled and motivated to find work quickly discover that jobs are particularly hard to get if one has a criminal record (Criminological Highlights 6(3)#2).  These two facts – along with the assumption that former prisoners need to work in order to survive in the community – suggest that it is important to find ways of increasing the likelihood that prisoners will be able to find and hold work when they are released., Work programs for former prisoners have a mixed history.  Some programs appear to work for certain people (Criminological Highlights 4(3)#6, 3(4)#2, 13(3)#5), but it would seem that simply providing skills to prisoners or finding them an initial job may not be enough.  Recently it appears (see 15(3)#5) that more comprehensive programs that begin while a person is still in prison and continue providing support after the prisoner is released may be more effective.  This paper reports the results of an experiment in which prisoners were randomly assigned to a program with ‘wrap around’ employment services starting in the prison or to receive the services that were normally available for those being released., The program evaluated in this paper involved 6 months of programming before the prisoner was released. This consisted of both vocational assistance and social-work interventions (3-4 months of programming designed to change risk factors thought to be related to future crime). For example, they had especially easy access to alcohol and drug programs. At the time of release, plans were put in place for those who were randomly assigned to the special comprehensive program to receive assistance in housing, transportation, obtaining relevant documents, and job searches.  Those randomly assigned to this treatment program were given automatic direct access to all these programs that, theoretically, were available to all state prisoners; those assigned to the control condition had (theoretical) access to them, but had to wait until there was a spot., The data from both groups demonstrates the challenges facing those trying to help reintegrate prisoners. About a third of each group had less than a high school education. Most owed restitution, and more than half had no funds when released.  Those assigned to the ‘experimental’ high-services group, on release, were eligible for work that, for about 6 months, was subsidized by the program.   Not surprisingly, prisoners in the treatment group were more likely to be employed during the first year.  However, the remarkably low median total income that was earned during the entire first year - $462 for the control group, $2690 for the treatment group – underlines the challenge facing those concerned with successful reintegration. Even those receiving special attention did not, on average, earn enough to subsist in society.   By the end of the first year, 72% of the control group and 63% of the treatment group had been re-arrested (a significant difference).  There was not a significant difference in the likelihood of re-incarceration., Conclusion: There is some support for the conclusion that wrap-around services – including employment services – can reduce recidivism.  From previous research it appears that “offering low-wage menial jobs and job-placement assistance without much help in other domains is not promising for achieving the goals of recidivism reduction or sustained increase in employment” (p. 377).  The problem may be that “released prisoners who have never had a regular connection to the labour market may be largely indifferent to [an offer of a temporary low-wage menial job offer], and [the] results on earnings seem to confirm that view as the norm…. A stronger test [of the value of an employment program for prisoners] would require a bigger ‘dose’ of legitimate opportunity [in the area of employment]” (p. 378)., Reference: Cook, Philip J., Songman Kang, Anthony A.

"Even in highly structured sentencing guideline systems, the prosecutor in charge of a case has a large impact on the sentence that an accused receives.",", In many jurisdictions, prosecutors and defence lawyers agree on a “joint submission” to the judge on what the sentence for an accused should be.  However, guideline systems often restrict the range of possible sentences that the parties can recommend just as mandatory minimum sentences restrict judges.  This study examines the variation that exists in the sentences handed down in a legal setting (the US federal guidelines) where the most obvious power of the prosecutor is to tell the judge that the person found guilty gave help to the prosecutor., Federal prosecutors in the US can recommend a downward departure from the guideline if they assert that the accused has given ‘substantial assistance’ to the prosecutor (e.g., by naming the source of drugs that were found on the offender). This study was carried out using data from 1998-2000, when the US federal guidelines were seen as mandatory rather than advisory (as they have been since 2005). The paper examines the influence of the judge and the prosecutor on the sentence that is imposed., The study uses data from 3 locations in which 18 judges sentenced 2686 offenders to prison. There were 97 different prosecutors and 431 judge-prosecutor combinations.  Various factors (e.g., the presumptive sentence for the offence under the guidelines, criminal record, race, type of offence, plea) were controlled for., Controlling for all available case characteristics, sentences varied depending on the judge and the prosecutor assigned to the case.  But above and beyond variation attributable to judges and prosecutors independently, it appears that the combination of judge and prosecutor makes a difference.  In other words, certain combinations of judges and prosecutors led to sentences that were not explainable by looking only at the identity of the judge and the prosecutor.  Particular combinations of judges and prosecutors appeared to lead to harsher or more lenient sentences than one would expect., Conclusion: Even at a time when the guidelines were considered mandatory, “Sentences varied by 6.5 months based on the judge [who sentenced the offender] and by more than a year based on the prosecutor…. Sentences also varied based on the judge-prosecutor dyad; in fact… the variation attributable to the judge-prosecutor dyad was greater than the variation attributable to the individual judge or prosecutor” (p. 615).  Given the power of the prosecutor under US guidelines, it is not surprising that “the results reveal greater disparity in sentencing based on the prosecutor than based on the judge.  This finding reflects the fact that the federal sentencing guidelines [prior to 2005] severely constrain the discretion of judges but do little to restrain the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in making decisions that affect sentence disparity” (p. 616)., Reference: Kim, Byungbae, Cassia Spohn and E.C.

"Some criminal justice treatments occasionally cause harm and some treatments that generally are seen as effective have, in many instances, no impact whatsoever.",", Most criminal justice interventions are never adequately evaluated.  Since people change over time without formal interventions, adequate evaluations almost invariably require some comparable comparison group that usually receives whatever treatment is normally available to people in that circumstance – the so-called ‘treatment as usual’ comparison group., In addition to the possibility of a program having no positive effects (and hence to not only be a waste of an opportunity to intervene effectively but also a waste of resources), there are a number of examples of interventions that have been demonstrated to have negative impacts on those who receive them (Criminological Highlights 5(4)#1, 6(2)#4).  This paper examines a number of systematic reviews that have been carried out of criminal justice interventions that have been adequately evaluated to examine whether harmful effects occur – defined in this case as interventions that increase the likelihood of subsequent offending. In this paper, systematic “Campbell Collaboration” reviews where some measure of individual offending was included as the outcome variable were examined to determine just how many programs had been shown to have favourable, null, and unfavourable effects.  These reviews covered 15 different types of interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy for offenders, mentoring programs,  drug courts, anti-bullying programs, and serious juvenile offender programs., One difficulty in drawing strong inferences about what constitutes a ‘good’ or a ‘bad’ intervention is that there are substantial differences across studies within a given ‘type’ of intervention.  For example, drug courts vary in the manner in which they are operated, the type of person who is assigned to the intervention, the type of treatment that may be associated with the court, and, of course, the nature of the comparison group that is used.  A simple ‘box score’ of the outcomes of drug court evaluations, therefore, may not be very helpful in predicting whether a given drug court will have a good, a bad, or no impact on future offending by those subjected to the drug court itself.  To be specific, this review found 71 drug court evaluations showing desirable effects, 78 showing no effects, and 5 demonstrating undesirable impacts. It is likely that there is no simple “drug court” model that has been used; instead, it may be that many of these 154 drug court programs have little in common with one another other than the fact that courts and those who have apparently used illegal drugs are involved.  Hence, it would be necessary, if one is interested in developing useful interventions, to ensure that any new program be properly monitored.  One cannot assume that just because many programs of a certain type have been shown to be effective, that a newly developed program that resembles those other programs will also be effective., In this review, most (n=391) of the interventions that were properly evaluated had no positive or negative impact though a fair number (n=232) had statistically significant positive impacts.  Twenty-two, however, had undesirable impacts on those subjected to them., Conclusion: “Unless social programs are evaluated for potential harm as well as benefit, safety as well as efficacy, the choice of which social programs to use will remain a dangerous guess” (p. 246).  More generally, “High quality designs are needed to be able to identify any harmful or beneficial treatment effects” (p. 246).  Given that programs vary across location and different instances of the same type of program may be offered to different types of people, it is difficult to determine in advance that any specific type of intervention is certain to be ‘good’ or ‘bad.’  However, given the range of outcomes that were found for 15 types of intervention, it is clear that those who rely on testimonials or good motives to justify a program are encouraging society to be wasteful of resources or worse., Reference: Welsh, Brandon C. and Michael Rocque (2014).

The use of risk assessment instruments for youths in determining pretrial release has an unanticipated effect: it reduces the use of pretrial detention.,", The usefulness of risk assessment instruments in the criminal justice system is usually measured by whether or not they predict future misbehaviour.   This study suggests that they may serve another function: reducing the use of pretrial detention., Typically, decisions about whether to release someone who has been arrested are based on subjective judgements.  A ‘risk’ analysis of these decisions suggests that decision makers are likely to be ‘risk averse’ and,  as a result, detain people who, in fact, are unlikely to misbehave in any important way (Criminological Highlights 11(1)#6).  An ‘objective’ risk assessment tool, then, may improve the decision-making process by giving comfort to decision makers that a decision to release is justified., When making pretrial release decisions, it is often impossible to obtain the full range of information that might be useful for a risk assessment.  The result is that risk assessment instruments (RAI) at this stage of the process are often developed ‘by consensus’ rather than as a result of an empirical investigation. They may, therefore, include factors that do not in fact predict whether or not an accused will appear in court when required or commit an offence while on release., In 2004, New Jersey developed a RAI for those making decisions on pretrial release for youths. It included 7 items related to the current charge, criminal record, and previous compliance with court orders. The goal of the study was to see whether the use of the RAI affected the proportion of youths who were detained., Cases before and after the introduction of the RAI were matched so that equivalent samples of accused people could be compared on whether or not the accused was released.   The “after” cases came from a period when the decision making tool had become standard practice.  The before and after cases were equivalent, then, on past and current offences, history of noncompliance with court orders, age, gender, race/ethnicity, and the time of day when the decision on detention was made., Prior to the implementation of the RAI, the detention rate had been 67%.  After the RAI was in place, the detention rate dropped to 40%. The size of this effect could have been influenced by other initiatives implemented at the same time including the provision of new alternatives to detention.  When using the risk assessment tool,  decision makers appeared to give more weight to various ‘objective’ factors in the detention decision, including the number and nature of the charges, and previous failures to appear. Whether the effect was purely the result of the RAI or was due to other policy-based interactions, the results do demonstrate that rates of pretrial detention can be reduced considerably., The largest impact appeared to be on the ‘average risk’ juveniles. They were considerably more likely to be released after the RAI was implemented than before, unless they were charged with very serious offences.  There was little impact of the RAI on low risk youths who, in both periods, tended to be released unless they committed a very serious offence.  There was little impact on high risk youths who were typically detained., Conclusion: It would appear that providing pretrial release decision makers with an ‘objective’ risk assessment increased the likelihood of pretrial release, especially for those who were of average risk.  The use of risk assessment instruments, then, can be seen as having at least two separate goals: to provide decision makers with an objective assessment of risk but also to reduce the detention of those who are not objectively high risk., Reference: Maloney, Carrie and Joel Miller (2015).  The Impact of a Risk Assessment Instrument on Juvenile Detention Decision-making: A Check on “Perceptual Shorthand” and “Going Rates”?  Justice Quarterly, 32(5), 900-927., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV15N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-15-no-5-%E2%80%93-march-2016,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 15, No. 5 – March 2016",Regular Issue,2016
Portugal’s decriminalization of possession of small amounts of drugs in 2001 had little impact because most of the changes had occurred prior to the change in the law.,", Previous research (see Criminological Highlights 11(5)#7) has demonstrated that when Portugal decriminalized the possession of small amounts of drugs in 2001 there were few measurable impacts on drug use or drug prosecutions.  This paper examines the reasons that so little change took place notwithstanding the rather dramatic change in the law., In 2001, Portugal decriminalized the acquisition, possession and personal use of small quantities of all psychoactive drugs.  One of the purposes of the change was to destigmatize addicted users and encourage them to seek treatment. Other aspects of the drug laws (e.g., production, distribution) did not change, nor did the new law permit or regulate use. In other words, to obtain drugs, one still had to rely on illicit markets and one still risked being apprehended by the police.  Portugal’s more liberal approach to drugs (i.e., decriminalizing simple possession of drugs) is consistent with policies in other European countries (e.g., Spain and Italy) that do not impose criminal sanctions for possession of small amounts of drugs., The orientation of Portugal’s criminal law prior to decriminalization “was symbolic rather than punitive… and [was] designed to encourage [the drug consumer] to seek treatment” (p. 751). The new law decriminalized the possession, for purposes of personal use, of an amount of any psychoactive drug deemed to be what a single person would use in 10 days.  However, those possessing an amount below the thresholds for criminal intervention were still issued an administrative citation., The number of police contacts with drug users (arrests and citations combined) did not change appreciably after the legal change was made, though most of these contacts shifted from resulting in court appearances to appearances before non-criminal bodies. However, the number of drug trafficking convictions declined by 27% and the year-end count of those in prison for drug offences dropped by 47%.  It would seem, then, that the criminal justice system “embraced de facto practices of greater leniency for at least some drug users and purveyors whose behaviour remained criminally sanctioned… . The drug reforms were, in part, an articulation of shifting sentiments and codification of penal practices already occurring with respect to drug use” (p. 758)., Survey data on recent use of any drug went up very slightly (from 3.4% admitting some recent use in 2001 to 3.7% in 2007).  Use of a psychoactive substance some time in one’s life went up more: from 7.8% to 12%.  The use of cannabis (and other drug use) measured by student surveys increased during the 1990s, but levelled off in 2003., Conclusion: “The reforms [in Portugal] were not a move toward liberty [in the use of drugs] but a shift from one arena of government involvement to another” (p. 775).  Other drug-related offences were left unchanged in the law. Nevertheless, there appeared to be fewer drug cases going into court even among those infractions that were still criminalized.  The law largely removed criminal sanctions and substituted an invitation to seek treatment. In effect, then, it would appear that the changes in law reflected changes in Portugal’s culture with respect to psychoactive drugs that had largely already occurred, rather than causing great changes in the manner in which those involved with psychoactive drugs were dealt with., Reference: Laqueur, Hannah (2015).

"‘Conflicted conservatives’ – those who identify themselves as being conservative, but who have liberal spending preferences – look like self-identified liberals in their opposition to police use of force.",", Conflicted conservatives – people who identify themselves as being political conservatives, but who favour liberal spending policies over conservative policies – comprise about 20% of the American electorate and about half of the self-identified conservatives.  Because they appear less committed to voting for a particular political party, they are, from an electoral perspective, an important group. This paper examines their views of police use of force., Conflicted conservatives are utilitarian in their outlook and, therefore, are relatively likely to vote for a candidate – of any party - who is likely to deliver the outcome they desire.  Criminologists often distinguish between utilitarian concerns about crime and “symbolic beliefs arising from worldviews, moral outrage or retributive desires” (p. 653).  It would be expected that conflicted conservatives views of criminal justice would be driven by utilitarian concerns rather than retributive desires., Using US General Social Survey data collected between 1972 and 2014, respondents were identified as being liberals, moderates, conflicted conservatives, or consistent conservatives.  Their place on the overall political spectrum was determined by their indication of where they stood on a 5-point scale ranging from “extremely conservative” to “extremely liberal” (p. 656). Consistent and conflicted conservatives were distinguished according to whether or not they favoured increased spending on issues such as improving and protecting the environment, improving the nation’s education system, and improving the conditions of Blacks., Support for police use of force was assessed with a series of questions about police use of force.  “Global support” was assessed with a question that asked whether respondents “could imagine a situation in which you would approve of a policeman striking an adult male citizen” (Global support, p. 656).  Support for “reasonable force” was assessed with questions such as one that asked whether they supported striking someone attempting to escape custody.  Support for “excessive force” was assessed with questions such as their approval of striking a citizen who used vulgar or obscene language with a police officer., Consistent conservatives were more supportive of police use of force (global, reasonable, and excessive) than conflicted conservatives. Indeed, conflicted conservatives, on some measures, were indistinguishable from moderates or liberals.   This is not an issue of simply how conservative they are.   Self-described ‘extremely conservative’ and ‘conservative’ respondents did not differ in their global views of police use of force or in their views of police use of reasonable force from those who described themselves as slightly conservative.  Those who described themselves as slightly conservative were, however, less supportive of police use of excessive force than the extreme conservatives. For conflicted conservatives, but not consistent conservatives, global support for police use of force was associated with confidence in government., Conclusion: It appears that conflicted conservatives are a distinct political group, looking much more like liberals and moderates than consistent conservatives in their level of support for police using force.  Said differently, understanding conservatives’ criminal justice attitudes requires more information than simply where on the political spectrum a respondent is.  Those conservatives who favour government spending on important social issues such as health are very different in their views of the police use of force from those who oppose this form of funding., Reference: Silver, Jasmine R. and Justin T.

Suspending or expelling children from school increases their subsequent criminal justice involvement.,"Previous research has suggested that children who miss school because of a school suspension or expulsion do less well academically than comparable non-punished peers, are more likely to commit offences, and are less likely to complete high school (Criminological Highlights 8(5)#4, 15(1)#1, 12(6)#1)., In addition, in the US, data suggest that “non-Whites are much more likely than Whites to be removed from school for less serious rule violations, including tardiness, disrespectfulness or classroom disruption….  In contrast, White children are more likely to seek and receive therapy or medication than Black and Hispanic children” (p. 117).  This study looks at the relationship between early school punishment and involvement in the criminal justice system, as well as the relationship between early therapy/medication and criminal justice involvement, during late adolescence and young adulthood., As part of the US National Longitudinal Study of Youth, mothers of young boys were asked if their children had ever been suspended or expelled from school between ages 6 and 14. Similar questions were asked about involvement in therapy or use of medication for troubles in school.  These children had been followed from birth onwards; hence it was possible to get measures of behaviour in childhood and performance in school before any suspension or expulsion might have taken place., Various differences among the children prior to the age at which they might have been suspended/expelled were controlled for.  These included school performance measures (e.g., test scores, repeating a grade) as well as race/ethnicity and poverty. In addition, measures often shown to relate to involvement in crime for young adults were controlled, including attitudes toward taking risks, whether the youth had graduated from high school, income, and depression., Above and beyond the effects of these childhood and young adulthood variables, being suspended or expelled from school increased the likelihood of involvement in the criminal justice system (conviction for charges other than minor traffic violations).  However, being suspended/expelled was unrelated to subsequent involvement in the mental health system. On the other hand, those youths who received therapy or medication for school-related problems were more likely subsequently to have some involvement with the mental health system, but were not more likely to be involved with the criminal justice system., The effects of school punishment are equally strong for Blacks, Hispanics and Whites. However, the relationship between early therapy or medication and subsequent involvement with the mental health system is stronger for Whites than it is for other groups., Conclusion: “By creating the impression that a boy is a ‘troublemaker’ and cutting him off from important educational resources, including classroom time and extracurricular opportunities, school punishment can contribute to a process of criminalization that significantly increases the odds of involvement in the criminal justice system” (p. 135).  Receiving treatment for school problems, however, is unrelated to subsequent criminal justice involvement.  “This process of criminalization, but not medicalization, contributes to what many legal scholars call the ‘school to prison pipeline’ in which children with behaviour problems are essentially tracked out of school and into the criminal justice system instead of alternative social control institutions like the mental health system” (p. 135)., Reference: Ramey, David M.

"In order for a country’s border enforcement efforts to be effective in limiting the number of illegal migrant workers, it is first necessary to understand something about the flow of these workers into and out of the country.",", It is estimated that between 1986 and 2008 the number of undocumented residents of the US increased from about 3 million to about 12 million, “despite a fivefold increase in the number of US Border Patrol officers, a fourfold increase in hours spent patrolling the border, and a twenty fold increase in nominal funding” (p. 1557-8)., This paper suggests that “the unprecedented militarization of the Mexico-US border not only failed in its attempt to reduce undocumented population growth but backfired by increasing the rate of undocumented population growth into the country and turning what had been a circular flow of male workers going into 3 states into a settled population of families living in 50 states” (p. 1558).  This study is based in part on detailed histories of border crossings collected, since 1982, from household surveys in 143 selected communities in Mexico as well as interviews of those who settled in the US but originated in these same communities., In 1965, the US began placing limits on Mexican immigration and, over the next 15 years, increasingly limited the number of temporary workers in the US.  In the late 1950s, it is estimated that approximately 450,000 Mexicans entered the US as temporary (largely agricultural) workers. By the late 1970s, this program had been completely eliminated.  Migration, however, did not stop; “it simply continued under undocumented auspices” (p. 1559).  However, during this period the migration was “overwhelmingly circular” (p. 1560).  What had changed is that the workers were no longer legal.  Public sentiment was aroused; in 1985 President Ronald Reagan declared the undocumented workers “a threat to national security” (p. 1561)., The militarization of the border, created with an approximately 10-fold increase in border control funding between 1980 and 2010, changed the locations and, most importantly, the risks of crossing from Mexico to the US.  Crossings became both more expensive and more hazardous. The likelihood of apprehension (and deportation back to Mexico) increased, though this could be reduced if potential migrants spent additional money on (illegal) help in crossing the border.  Many, however, simply tried again.  It is estimated that of those who tried to enter before 2008, 95% eventually succeeded.   Circular migration – entering the US temporarily to work and then return to Mexico – became less attractive, given the costs and risks of entry to the US., Not surprisingly, Mexicans were most likely to enter the US illegally when there was demand for their labour, Mexican wages were low, and when they had connections with those already in the US.  However, the age of those entering the US illegally increased between 1970 and 2010.  Few returned to Mexico, given the costs and risks involved.  In 1980, it is estimated that approximately 45% returned to Mexico within a year. By 2010, it is estimated that this had dropped to close to zero., Conclusion: The massive increase in US Border Control expenditures after 1986 “had no effect on the likelihood of taking a first undocumented trip northward or the odds of gaining entry to the US on such a trip, but it did have a strong effect in decreasing the likelihood of returning to Mexico once an entry had been achieved” (p. 1588).   “The combination of increasingly costly and risky trips and the near certainty of getting into the US created a decision-making context in which it still made economic sense to migrate but not to return home to face the high costs and risks of subsequent entry attempts” (p. 1590).  Dramatically increased policing of the border, then, had a net effect of increasing the number of undocumented workers in the US., Reference: Massey, Douglas S., Jorge Durand, and Karen A.

"Police interactions with ordinary citizens involving ‘stop, question, and frisks’ appear to have very little effect on crime.",", High rates of policing of locations known to be high in crime (crime ‘hot spots’) appear to have a modest impact on crime in that location, but the impact is apparently temporary and may only be effective if high density policing is coupled with certain types of police activity (Criminological Highlights 12(3)#3, 13(3)#2, 14(5)#3)., This study looks at the impact of “stop, question, and frisks” (SQFs) of ordinary citizens in New York City (NYC).  SQFs often take place in locations identified by the police as ‘hot spots.’ This and other forms of active policing are sometimes seen as the cause of the drop in homicides in NYC.   It is estimated that in 2003, there were approximately 160,000 SQF stops and 597 homicides. The number of SQF stops increased such that by 2011, there were 685,000 and ‘only’ 515 homicides.  After the courts ruled them unconstitutional in 2013, the number of such stops dropped to about 47,000 in 2014 and homicides also declined to 333. This study attempts to see whether SQFs – carried out at high rates before they were found to be unconstitutional - actually have an impact on crime., The method was to look at crime on ‘street segments’ – essentially a city block, including the two intersections – during the years (2006-11) when an unconstitutionally high number of SQFs were carried out.  The goal was to see if an SQF carried out on a given street segment in a given week had any effect on crime on that same street segment the following week.  Looking across all 5 NYC boroughs, the data suggest that an SQF one week reduced non-traffic related crime on that street segment in 3 of the 5 boroughs., However, “in the peak years of SQFs in NYC, almost 700,000 SQFs would lead to only a 2% decline in crime” (p. 47).  Attributing the decline in crime solely to the SQF is problematic in that it is impossible to separate out the effect of the SQF on crime from the mere presence of police. In addition, attributing this modest drop in crime to the SQF ignores the “degree that SQFs are coupled with other policing strategies” (p. 49).  Specifically, “[i]n light of research findings on the effectiveness of directed patrol, the prolonged presence of police in a crime hot spot might very well be the active ingredient of SQFs, as opposed to anything that the police were doing” (p. 61).  As one commentator noted “the efficacy of the SQF tactic, at least from the standpoint of marginal deterrence, is considerably more ambiguous than its advocates might like to admit” (p. 62). Finally, even if there is a small effect, it is impossible to know whether this effect relates only to only certain types of SQFs (e.g., those involving actual offenders)., Conclusion: Although the data suggest that stop, question and frisks (SQFs) may be associated with small reductions in crime in the location in which the police stop took place, one has to consider the other effects of SQFs: “The aggressive use of SQFs could erode citizens’ willingness to report crime to, or to cooperate in investigation or intelligence gathering with, the police. In a recent survey…  young respondents who were stopped more frequently reported less willingness to report crimes even when they were the crime victims” (p. 63).  Even if it could be shown that the apparent effects of SQFs on crime are due to SQFs and not some other correlated factor, “[t]he question is whether this approach [SQFs] is the best one for crime prevention at hot spots and whether its benefits are greater than its potential negative impacts on citizen evaluations of police legitimacy” (p. 50)., References:  Weisburd, David, Alese Wooditch, Sarit Weisburd, and Sue-Ming Yang (2015).

"For young people who were incarcerated as youths, gaining employment as adults reduces involvement in crime.",", The transition from adolescence into the adult workforce is particularly difficult for those with criminal records. This study attempts to understand the apparent reduction in crime that often takes place for those who do manage to find employment.  Simply put, is it the financial support that is critical or is the reduction in crime due to other aspects of the employment relationship?, The study examines the lives of 270 boys and 270 girls who experienced an average of about 21 months in a juvenile justice institution in the Netherlands.  Their employment and criminal justice involvement were then followed until age 32.  The goal was to understand the impact of employment and other forms of income support on offending. Under the Dutch system, income support could be in the form of payments while the person was unemployed, public assistance, or payments because of a disability.  Hence, for 14 years (from age 18 to age 32), the effect of employment and income support on offending could be estimated for each individual.  In addition, controlling for various other personal and demographic factors, the effect of employment differences on involvement in crime across individuals could be estimated., During this 14 year period, 75% of the men and 40% of the women were convicted of at least one offence. Most (about 85%) were employed at least once, though typically for about a quarter of each year.  For two types of analysis (the effect of different levels of employment across individuals and the effect of changes in employment on offending within individual), being employed was associated with decreased offending.  This was equally true for both men and women.  For men – but not for women – receiving public assistance appeared to reduce offending.  When property offending was examined alone, it appears, once again, that the impact of employment was consistent across statistical models and gender.  Income support, once again, only seems to reduce property offending for men. In addition, when looking across individuals, it appeared that the length of employment for men was associated with reduced violent offending., Employment, in general, was more strongly associated with reduction in offending than was income support suggesting that in addition to “merely receiving an income, the nonmonetary aspect of work, such as social control or reduced opportunity to engage in crime because of changes in daily routine activities, are important in reducing criminal behaviour” (p. 563)., Conclusion: The findings suggest that “informal social control that [is a normal part of] employment is important in explaining the reduced offending rates for both men and women, even though [Dutch] women are more likely to work part-time and might attach less value to work than men” (p. 563).  More generally, however, findings such as these suggest that programs for those returning to the community from prison may have an importance and impact that is larger than one would expect simply from the effects of providing additional support., Reference: Verbruggen, Janna, Robert Apel, Victor R.

Being randomly assigned to receive housing and support services from Housing First – a Vancouver (Canada) program that provides housing and mental health services to people who are homeless and who suffer a mental disorder – reduced subsequent criminal convictions.,", The combination of being homeless and mentally ill is associated with relatively high rates of offending.  Not surprisingly, therefore, prisons tend to have a disproportionate number of people suffering from a mental illness.  This study addresses the problem of the mentally ill in the criminal justice system by attempting to deal with, simultaneously, their housing and mental health needs., Adults with a diagnosed mental disorder who were homeless or precariously housed (i.e., they lived in transitional housing after at least two periods of homelessness in the previous year) and who had at least one prior contact with the British Columbia (Canada) justice system were randomly assigned to one of three types of treatment: 
(a) Scattered site (SS) treatment in which individuals were offered choice of housing (typically among 2-3 available units) in buildings scattered across the city of Vancouver. Approximately 20% of the units were occupied by the previously homeless.  The study participants assigned to this treatment type were provided with access to psychiatric and primary healthcare services by a treatment team, 24-hours a day, 7 days a week. 
(b) Congregate housing (CONG) in which individuals were placed in a former hotel in which all residents were study participants. All residents had access to psychiatric and primary health services at any time. In addition, there were attempts to promote a community among residents through various programs and activities.  
(c) A treatment-as-usual (TAU) group of individuals who received the normal services available to those experiencing homelessness and mental illness., Conviction data – drawn from the Provincial Courts in British Columbia – were obtained for all participants for a period that varied between 9 and 24 months.  Those assigned to the “Scattered Site” treatment were significantly less likely to be convicted of any subsequent offences than the treatment-as-usual group.  The Congregate group was marginally less likely to be convicted than the treatment-as-usual group., Obviously, it is not possible from this study to disentangle the separate and combined effects of the housing and mental health services.  It is also not clear why there was apparently a difference between the Congregate and the Scattered Site conditions., Conclusion: The results of this random assignment experiment “demonstrate that Housing First [housing plus mental health support] produces significant reductions in reconvictions compared to usual care.  People who are both homeless and mentally ill are frequently in contact with the justice system, a process that is both destabilizing to the individual and costly to society… Housing First has been shown to improve housing stability and health service involvement.  [These results show] improvements in public safety and reductions in crime” (p. 6)., Reference: Somers, Julian M., Stefanie N.

We do not have evidence that crisis intervention teams – designed to help police deal more effectively with the mentally ill –  are effective in reducing the use of criminal charges and in minimizing the use of force by police.,", With the reduced use of secure mental health facilities to house the mentally ill, the police in many jurisdictions are called upon to respond to various forms of disruption and crime involving people apparently suffering from mental illness. Crisis Intervention Teams (CITs) are designed to help the police link the mentally ill with community programs, thus providing an alternative to criminal justice processing. This paper examines the currently existing data on the effectiveness of CITs in achieving this goal., One model that has been used (the “Memphis Model” of CITs) has been to provide training to police officers about mental illness and in handling mental illness crises. The focus is on de-escalation techniques, providing resources within the community for the mentally ill, and on ensuring the police know about these resources so that mentally ill people can be treated in the community rather than being arrested., Various outcome measures are relevant in determining whether CITs ‘work.’ These include the possible reduction in charges, decreased use of force, increased officer safety, and reduced time spent by police officers processing those with mental illnesses who come in contact with the police.  This review examines the existing research on arrests, use of force, and police officer safety. In order for a study to be considered as providing evidence on one or more of these factors, it was necessary that there be a comparable control group where the CIT was not available., Perhaps the most discouraging finding is that out of 820 papers reporting ‘evidence’ about CITs, only 8 studies were carried out that both had an appropriate control group and had measures of one or more of these outcomes. Seven were US studies, one was Australian.  In understanding the ‘outcome’ findings, one needs to remember that there is no ‘standard’ definition of a CIT.  Hence differences across studies may well reflect differences in procedures used by the CIT or differences in other aspects of the program and its clients., There was no overall impact of the availability of CITs on arrests, though the results of the five studies were “significantly heterogeneous” (p. 85) suggesting that the different patterns may reflect more than just random variation.  Various different measures (self-reports, official records) were used in different studies on officer use-of-force. None of the five studies showed favourable impacts on use-of-force and the combined effect of the use of a CIT across the eight studies, once again, was not significant.  Injury to police officers, as it turns out, was rarely reported and could not be assessed adequately. Data are not available on other possible benefits such as the reduction of stigma and time spent in processing cases., Conclusion: In this review of the “highest quality studies available of the effectiveness of CIT (Crisis Intervention Team) models” (p. 90), there was no convincing evidence that they reduce arrests or officer use of force.  One possible explanation for the ‘null’ effects is that, in recent years, even officers working in environments without formal CIT programs may have become more willing to look for alternatives to arrest.  But the simple conclusion that the CIT model is “effective” and should be implemented more broadly cannot be sustained on the basis of available research.  On the other hand, police services should be encouraged to experiment with – and evaluate – what the most effective approach is in responding to calls involving the mentally ill in their communities., Reference: Taheri, Sema A.

It is unlikely that warnings from Canadian police given to youths are adequately understood by them.,", As with adults, Canadian police must inform accused youths of their legal rights. For example, youths have a right to legal counsel; they can consult parents or other adults, and youths can choose to have parents and/or counsel present during questioning.  They are not required to make statements to the police., The Youth Criminal Justice Act specifies that the warnings to the youth of the youth’s rights must be “in language appropriate to his or her age and understanding” (s. 146(2)(b)). However, the form of the various warnings is not specified in the legislation. Hence police services have developed special formal warnings for youths that can be read to youths when they are arrested.  This study examines a simple question: Is it likely that youths understand these warnings?, There is a good deal of research (e.g., Criminological Highlights 11(3)#7) that suggests many police warnings designed for ordinary citizens are often written in ways that make them difficult to understand.   In this study, 50 warning statements from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and from at least one police service in each province and territory were studied. There were 31 “unique” warnings. (The remainder were used by more than one police service). The police services that provided the warnings for the study are responsible for policing at least 90% of Canada’s population., Two very different forms of assessment of these 31 different warning forms were employed. First, the ‘complexity’ of the forms was assessed.  For example, long statements are generally more difficult to understand. The warnings varied in length from 239 to 1192 words. The statements were also assessed according to standardized measures of the school grade level needed to comprehend the statements as well as the grade level at which specific important words would be likely to be understood.  The estimated grade level needed to understand the warnings ranged from approximately Grade 6 (age 12) to Grade 12 (age 18). Many of these warning statements contained words that would not be expected to be understood by those well over the age of criminal responsibility in Canada (age 12)., In a separate study, 32 students, aged 15-17, in St. Johns, Newfoundland & Labrador were read the forms used by their local police service. They were asked to indicate whether they understood what was read to them and their confidence in their comprehension of the warning. They were then asked to write down the information that they would give to a close friend who was arrested.  Broadly speaking, the students were, not surprisingly,  able to recall more of the warnings when tested after each section was read to them than when they were asked to recall what they had been told after all information had been delivered. However, only 22% of the respondents recalled more than half of the information contained in the warning., Conclusion:  Perhaps because warnings are often long and written in language that is difficult for youths to understand, it is it not surprising that young people do not fully understand the warnings that are normally used by police.  “Also of importance was the fact that participants [who were read the warnings used by their local police] reported high levels of confidence in how much they understood and almost always confirmed that they understood the rights that were presented – despite the overall low level of comprehension.  This finding suggests that simply asking youths whether they understood the rights is not a useful procedure for ensuring that youths actually understand their rights” (p. 821). But, in addition, other research would suggest that even if they understand the ‘words’, youths may not be able to resist the pressures to make statements to the police (Criminological Highlights 13(4)#2)., Reference: Eastwood, Joseph, Brent Snook, and Kirk Luther (2015).  Measuring the Reading Complexity and Oral Comprehension of Canadian Youth Waiver Forms.

Police officers are less likely to use force against civilians when they believe that their actions are being recorded.,", has made it possible, at least in theory, to monitor more closely how officers respond to difficult interactions with civilians.  Results from three recent papers suggest that police officers, when they believe their actions are being recorded, are less likely to use force with civilians., Body-worn cameras (BWCs) are the most recent piece of technology whose effects on police behaviour have been examined.  The challenge, of course, is not just to monitor the behaviour of police officers when they are wearing BWCs, but to find an appropriate comparison to know whether any change is really caused by wearing the BWC.  Said differently, control groups are necessary., In a study carried out in Orlando, Florida, police officers volunteered to be part of a study of the effects of BWCs.  Eighty-nine officers volunteered for the study and were randomly assigned either to use the BWC during all shifts for the next 12 months or to carry out their usual duties without the BWC.  The main measures used were reports of incidents where force was used with a civilian. Citizen complaints were also monitored.  The results show that the two groups were similar on these two measures before the 12-month test period, but that during the 12 months of the study, the officers with the BWCs were less likely to have used force with a civilian at least one time and were less likely to have been the subject of a civilian complaint., In another study in a small California city, BWCs were employed on a random basis by all front line police officers on about half of 988 police shifts during a one year period.  In other words, on a random basis, all police officers during a shift would be wearing BWCs or none would.   The ‘shift’, then, was the unit of analysis and the research question was whether there was a change in the number of use-of-force incidents during BWC-shifts as compared to control shifts.  During this period, there were more incidents of police use-of-force during control shifts than during the BWC-shifts. There were very few complaints about police behaviour in either type of shift.  More interesting, perhaps, is the fact that the overall number of recorded uses of force in the police service dropped dramatically during the study (from about 65 per year to 25).  The number of complaints also dropped – from an average of 40 to 3.  Since these decreases are too large to have been the result of having cameras during only some of the shifts,  it may be that simply carrying out the experiment and the discussion and training that it entailed made officers more cautious about the use of force, whether or not they were wearing a camera at the time. Alternatively, this could be an effect of other events and concerns happening at the time., In a third study, a former Canadian police officer interviewed 231 police officers in two cities about the impact of potentially having their interactions with civilians captured by video cameras on citizens’ smart phones. Most (94%) reported that they had, at some point, been aware of being recorded by a citizen.  Most (84%) reported high level of awareness, during their normal activities, of the possibility that their actions would be recorded.  Most importantly, most officers (74%) reported that they thought that their behaviour had changed because of the possibility that it would appear on social media., Conclusion: It would appear that police officers are, not surprisingly, affected by the possibility that their everyday behaviour and their use of force will become an ‘objective record’ for the public to assess.   The data suggest that body-worn cameras may reduce the use of force by police officers in their interactions with the public., References: Jennings, Wesley G., Mathew D.

Punitive policies in schools interfere with the school performance of students who are not directly subject to those policies.,"Perhaps the most punitive policies under the control of schools involve the suspension of troublesome students.  School suspension rates in the US public schools have doubled since the 1970s. A key rationale for policies encouraging the suspension of troublesome students is that it benefits non-suspended students.  The difficulty, as some research has suggested, is that “a punitive school environment can subvert genuine institutional authority and create student apathy and disconnection” (p. 1071)., This study examines the effect of school suspensions on math and reading achievement in 16,148 students in Grades 6-10 in 17 schools over a three year (6 semester) period.  22% of the students had experienced at least one suspension during their school careers.  The number of suspensions in a school during a given semester was used to predict test performance at the end of that semester.  Because of the longitudinal design, students, in effect, act as their own control, since each student’s change in performance can be examined as a function of variation in school disciplinary practices over time. The analysis, however, focuses only on those students not suspended during the three years of the study in order to understand the effect of suspensions (of other students) on those still in school. Various other individual measures are included in order to control for differences in students (e.g., economic factors, disciplinary infractions, whether the student was receiving special education services) and differences in the schools (e.g., racial makeup, overall student characteristics, drug and violence problems), The effect of the number of school suspensions on the reading scores of those students not suspended is curvilinear. “Increasing school suspension is associated with very modest growth in reading achievement, to about the mean level of exclusionary discipline, at which point achievement begins to decline rapidly with increasing suspension” (p. 1076).   The harm associated with increasing exclusionary discipline is particularly strong in schools with low levels of violence. In very violent schools, the negative effect of high levels of suspension can still be seen, but the effect is less pronounced., The results for math achievement were very similar.  “High levels of exclusionary discipline threaten math achievement in all schools but are particularly problematic in organized and non-violent environments” (p. 1079)., In interpreting these results, it is important to recall that the effects that are described relate to those students who are not suspended.  In other words, excluding those who, presumably, are disruptive has negative impacts on those who are not misbehaving., Conclusion: The findings suggest that “punishment is not a discrete response to certain transgressions, but a system of social order that produces wider meanings and consequences” (p. 1083).  It may be that “high suspension environments can create a heightened sense of anxiety, constituting a psychological burden of control” (p. 1083). In addition, “frequent use of suspension [may] disrupt school communities” (p. 1083) or could undermine the sense that people are being treated fairly.  Whatever the reasons, the “findings level a strong argument against punitive and control-oriented school policies that result in high suspension rates” since these policies “threaten the academic success of all students, even those who have never been suspended” (p. 1085)., Reference: Perry, Brea L. and Edward W.

People who have been incarcerated for homicide offences are very unlikely to commit another homicide offence when they are released back to the community.,", Releasing homicide offenders into the community is often controversial.  The Canadian Minister of Justice recently introduced a bill requiring life without parole for certain homicide offenders, suggesting that it “demonstrates our continued commitment to protecting Canadians.”   The question  is whether there is a special need to protect ordinary citizens from those released on parole from, or after serving, a prison sentence for murder or whether protection from homicide specifically, or violent offences more generally, could best be accomplished by investing resources elsewhere., In a Swedish study, 153 homicide offenders were tracked for 32 years.  Five (3%) committed a subsequent homicide offence (2 murders and 3 other homicide offences).  Those homicide offenders who, during the follow-up period, committed any serious offence (10% of the sample) were substantially younger when they committed the first offence (29) than those who did not commit another violent offence (36).   Repeat homicides occurred an average of only 5.0 years (range 1-11 years) after the earlier homicide, reflecting the fact that in Sweden sentences tend to be considerably shorter than in the US or Canada.  Repeat homicide offenders tended to be young when they committed their first offence, and were still relatively young when they committed their second., An American study, examining the 3-year recidivism rates of prisoners released in 15 states, also shows low rates of homicide re-offending.  In that study 1.2% of 4,433 people released from prison after serving a sentence for any form of homicide were re-arrested for a subsequent homicide offence.  However, this group was dramatically more likely to be re-arrested for a property (10.8%) or drug offence (13%) than for homicide. Those released after serving time for homicide were responsible for fewer than 1% of all homicides that occurred during this period., A Canadian report on 4,131 people who had previously committed murder found that 13 of them who were on full or day parole committed repeat homicide offences from 1975 to 1999. One of these 13 had previously been convicted of capital or first degree murder. An additional 24 of the 7,652 offenders serving sentences for manslaughter committed another homicide offence while on conditional release.  Most of this latter group (16) were on ‘statutory release’ (a presumptive form of supervised release prior to the end of the sentence for those not released on parole).  “Repeat homicide offenders [of all types] on conditional supervision accounted for less than four tenths of 1% of the [15,266] reported homicide deaths in Canada [during this 24 year period]” (p. 5)., Conclusion:  Parole authorities are cautious about releasing those convicted of murder.  This is reflected by the fact that 82% of those serving sentences for 1st degree murder in Canada are currently in custody. The only certain way to reduce reoffending in the community to zero for those convicted of murder would be to prohibit release of everyone  serving a life sentence for murder.  To reduce the number of 'repeat homicides' by those convicted of 1st or 2nd degree murder to zero, Canada would have to imprison the 1749 people serving life sentences for murder currently in the community, at a net additional cost (imprisonment cost minus supervision cost) of $145 million a year.  Focusing on, and focusing resources on, this group, however, ignores the fact that 99.6% of homicides in Canada were not committed by those who had committed a previous homicide offence., References: Sturup, Joakim and Per Linquist (2014): Homicide Offenders 32 years Later: A Swedish Population-based Study on Recidivism.  Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health, 24, 5-17.  Langan, Patrick.A. and David.J.

Youths who are enrolled in “advantaged” schools – most notably boys and those who are especially high risk for offending – are less involved in offending than would be the case if they were in less advantaged schools.,", It is well established that youths’ own levels of delinquency are affected by the delinquency level of those whom they spend time with (see Criminological Highlights 6(4)#5, 6(4)#6,  7(4)#5, 10(5)#3, 10(6)#4, 14(2)#3, 14(2)#4).  This paper extends these findings by relating the characteristics of the school that a young person attends to the youth’s involvement in delinquency.  Specifically, the paper examines the differential impact of the school environment on youths who vary in personality characteristics related to involvement in delinquency., Schools in many cities vary dramatically in terms of the socioeconomic status of the families of the students, the ethnicity of the students, and the likelihood that students have been involved with the justice system.  Thus, like neighbourhoods (see Criminological Highlights 1(2)#2, 8(1)#5,  8(2)#4, 9(6)#6,  10(5)#3, 11(6)#8, 13(3)#6, 14(1)#5, 14(2)#5), schools may have an independent effect on a youth’s offending.  In addition, research has shown that youths with certain personality types – impulsivity and sensation seeking, for example – are more likely to be involved in crime.  This paper investigates the hypothesis that the impact of personal characteristics related to offending in youths – being male and being impulsive/sensation seeking – is reduced in “advantaged” schools (those with large numbers of youths from relatively well-off families, etc.)., Data were collected from a sample of 5619 Grade 9 youths from 89 schools in Stockholm, Sweden. A measure of ‘school advantage’ was developed consisting of three highly correlated indicators: the average student marks at the school, the percent of students in the school born in Sweden, and the percent of students with at least one parent with post-secondary education., A delinquency measure – self-reports of  the frequency of 19 different offences, calculated so as to give more weight to more serious offences – was calculated for each student. Various individual controls were also included in the analyses: gender, how long the youth had lived in Sweden, parents’ education, family structure, parental unemployment, alcohol and drug use, whether the youth smoked, and the youth’s marks. Impulsivity/sensation seeking was measured by the youth’s level of agreement with statements such as “I like doing exciting and dangerous things, even if they are forbidden” and “Sometimes I do things without thinking.”, Not surprisingly, delinquency was, overall, lower in the more advantaged schools, even controlling for the individual characteristics of the youths. Girls reported less delinquency than boys.   More interesting was the fact that the impact of impulsivity/sensation-seeking traits was lower in more organized schools, even taking into account all of the control variables. Said differently, in the more advantaged schools, there was very little impact of the youth’s level of impulsivity/sensation seeking; but in the less advantaged schools, there were strong effects of impulsivity/sensation-seeking.  Similarly, the difference between delinquency levels for boys and girls was lower in the advantaged schools., Conclusion: The impact of personal characteristics normally related to involvement in delinquency – being male and being impulsive/sensation-seeking are reduced in favourable settings (advantaged schools).   It is possible that the advantaged schools have higher levels of social cohesion and social control, or that the youths are simply exposed to fewer risk factors.  Whatever the reason, it would appear that providing favourable settings for ‘at risk’ youths, in particular, can reduce offending., Reference: Elkund, Jenny M. and Johan Fritzell (2014).

Providing a court with a victim impact statement does not necessarily make victims less anxious or angry.  Other factors – also in control of the justice system – may be more important determinants of the recovery process.,", There is a great deal of variability in how people are affected by criminal victimizations.  What is known, however, is that those who choose to provide the court with a victim impact statement (VIS) typically differ from those who decline to take advantage of this opportunity., Although not all of those who are offered the opportunity to provide a VIS to the court actually do so, it has been suggested that it is important to provide people with the opportunity because it helps give victims some control over their recovery process. Focusing on feelings of anxiety and anger, this paper first looks at the differences among three groups of people who were offered the opportunity to make a VIS: those who choose not to provide a VIS and two groups of people who chose to provide a criminal court with a VIS – those whose VIS was in written form and those who made an oral VIS statement in court.  The main interest in the study was change – from 2 weeks before the court appearance to 2 weeks after – in feelings of anxiety and anger as a function of the victim’s choice of how to respond to the offer to make a VIS., Dutch victims who were eligible to submit a VIS (as a victim of a serious violent crime or a surviving relative of one) filled out a questionnaire 2 weeks before the scheduled date for the trial and again 2 weeks after the trial.  They were also interviewed 4 weeks after the trial. Anger was measured by degree of agreement with such questions as “When I get angry I stay angry” and “My anger has had a bad effect on my health.”   Anxiety was measured by the degree of agreement with “I can sit at ease and feel relaxed.”  In addition, they were asked to indicate their feelings of the level of control they had over the recovery process.  This was measured with questions such as “I don’t feel there is much I can do to help myself feel better” (p. 24)., Women were more likely than men to choose to present an oral or written VIS. There were no age differences or differences in familiarity with the perpetrator for the three groups. Two weeks before the court appearance, those who had chosen to present a written or oral VIS were more anxious and reported lower levels of control over the recovery process than those who chose not to present a VIS.  Those who provided a written VIS also had higher levels of anger, before the court appearance, than the other two groups., Two weeks after the court appearance, the two VIS groups had higher levels of anxiety and anger than the group who chose not to present a VIS. “Delivering a VIS has no direct ‘therapeutic’ effects in the sense that this leads to significant decreases in feelings of anger or anxiety” (p. 30). Furthermore, there was “no evidence that delivering a VIS results in significantly higher feelings of control over the recovery process” (p 30).  However, those victims who felt that they had been dealt with in a procedurally just fashion appeared to show reductions in feelings of anger and anxiety., Conclusion: The data suggest that the act of providing a written or oral victim impact statement cannot be assumed to have positive therapeutic effects.  Nevertheless, the choice to provide a victim impact statement sets those victims apart from those who do not, and highlights the need to focus on “helping crime victims overcome the trauma they have experienced and examine possible positive effects of participating in criminal justice procedures” (p. 31)., Reference: Lens, Kim ME, Antony Pemberton, Karen Brans, Johan Braeken, Stefan Gogaerts, and Esmah Lahlah (2015).  European Journal of Criminology, 12(1), 17-34., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV15N1.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-15-no-1-%E2%80%93-april-2015,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 15, No. 1 – April 2015",Regular Issue,2015
Procedural justice is just as important for youths as it is for adults in understanding their views of the legitimacy of the police and their willingness to report crimes to the police.,", A number of studies have demonstrated that the manner in which the police treat those whom they come in contact with is important in understanding citizens’ views of the legitimacy of the police and their willingness to report offences to the police (see, for example, Criminological Highlights 4(4)#1, 7(1)#4, 11(4)#1).  This study examines whether the effect of fair treatment on the perceived legitimacy of the police is the same for youths as it is for adults., A heterogeneous sample of 513 youths (age 12-17) in grades 7-10 in a medium sized Australian city were sampled along with 2611 adults (age 18-94, mean=49) from the same city. In a written survey, police legitimacy was measured by the extent of agreement with statements such as whether “Most police are honest” and “I have great respect for the police.”  Respondents’ views of procedural justice by police were measured as the extent of agreement with statements such as “It depends on what mood a police officer is in whether they book you/tell you off” or “Police treat you differently depending on where you live”.  Police effectiveness was measured with questions such as “How well do police do in dealing with problems that concern people in your suburb/at keeping an eye on gangs of young people?” (p. 76).  Various control measures were included in regression analyses including age, gender, whether respondents were of Australian ancestry, and whether they had had recent contact with the police., Regression analyses, carried out separately for youths and for adults, showed generally similar effects for youths and adults. Those who rated the police favourably on the measure of procedural justice were more likely to see the police as acting legitimately in the community. A similar, and independent, effect on police legitimacy was found for police effectiveness. Further, those who viewed the police favourably on the procedural justice measures were also more likely than others to report that they would report crimes (e.g., a gang beating up someone).  However, one effect was significant only for youths: youths, but not adults, who saw the police as being highly effective were more likely to indicate that they would report criminal incidents to the police., The effects of procedural justice and police effectiveness on reporting criminal incidents to the police were mediated by views of the legitimacy of the police.  When adults and youths believe that the police act in a procedurally fair way, they see police as generally acting legitimately. This, in turn, appears to increase the likelihood that they would report crime to the police.  The results for adults are similar to those for youths, but it would appear that views of police legitimacy in adults do not fully mediate, or explain, the relationship between views of procedural justice of the police and the reporting of crime., Conclusion: “Procedural justice policing has many advantages over a coercive deterrence-based policing approach. The main advantage is that the motivation by young people to obey the rules and norms of society, as well as obey police directives, is self-regulatory under a procedural justice policing model. This means that… people voluntarily defer to police requests and directives and are less likely to challenge and defy police decisions” (p. 71). It appears that youths’ views of the police, once established, are related to cooperation with the police in much the same way as they are for adults. Once again, the findings demonstrate the importance of fair and respectful treatment by the police of ordinary citizens – for both youths and adults., Reference: Murphy, Kristina (2015).  Does Procedural Justice Matter to Youth?

"Residents of Canada, the UK, USA, Australia and New Zealand who believe that people are responsible for - and should be held responsible for - their own economic welfare also believe that sentences are too lenient.",", The term “economic individualism” usually refers to a set of beliefs supporting the view that “each individual is responsible for their own welfare and that economic success is a function of hard work and thrift” (p. 28).  There are two reasons “to expect that economic individualism may be relevant to explaining punitive attitudes: economic individualism results in dispositional attribution of crime, and economic individualism causes negative attitudes toward the poor” (p. 29)., Economic individualism may encourage people to believe that an offender’s behaviour is completely subject to their own control and that social or community factors are irrelevant in understanding why people commit offences (see also, Criminological Highlights 13(1)#5).  Crime, therefore, is seen as being the result of a strategic decision that a person makes on how to maximize personal rewards.  Belief in this theory of crime, would logically lead one to assume that crime can be effectively controlled by making the ‘cost’ of crime higher with harsher penalties., But in addition, economic individualism may cause negative attitudes towards the poor, since they have demonstrated that they are not exerting effort to move themselves from poverty. Poverty and low status are seen as a consequence of personal failure, not structural features of society.  Punitiveness, then, is “part of a general constellation of resentment toward, and scapegoating of [the poor]” (p. 31)., This study examines the relationship between economic individualism and punitive attitudes in Canada, the UK, USA, Australia and New Zealand.  The measures used include two types of economic individualism. “Descriptive individualism” reflects “whether respondents attribute people getting ahead in life, or being in need, to personal effort” (p. 33). Normative individualism, on the other hand, reflects respondents’ views of whether the governments should take an active role in providing for people and improving their standards of living. Punitiveness was measured by support for harsher sentences and support for the death penalty.  Various control factors (age, gender, minority status, education, income, religiosity, marital status, and conservatism) were included in the analysis., Data from surveys collected for various other purposes from these five countries were analyzed for this study.  Because the surveys were each carried out independently, the measures varied somewhat from country to country,  and not all measures were available everywhere.  Overall, in theory, there might have been 20 tests of the hypothesis (2 types of individualism by 2 measures of punitiveness, by 5 countries).  However, data were only available for 18 tests of the hypotheses. Sample sizes varied, for the individual analyses, from 419 to 5758., In 15 of 18 tests of the hypothesis the relationship between individualism (descriptive and normative) and punitiveness (support for harsher sentences or for the death penalty) was significant. In the other 3, the trend was in the same direction, but not statistically significant. Over and above the control variables, economic individualism – both descriptive and normative – predicted support for harsh sentences and support for the death penalty., Conclusion:  The results support the conclusion that economic individualism and dispositional attributions of crime are linked to punitive attitudes. “Relatively consistently across the countries studied, a belief that success is the product of hard work and a preference for individual responsibility for one’s own economic well-being predicts support for punitive sentencing” (p. 39)., Reference: Kornhauser, Ryan (2015).  Economic Individualism and Punitive Attitudes: A Cross-National Analysis.  Punishment & Society, 17(1), 27-53., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV15N1.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-15-no-1-%E2%80%93-april-2015,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 15, No. 1 – April 2015",Regular Issue,2015
Records of arrests by police not leading to convictions make it difficult to get a job.,", Previous research has established that those with criminal records have a more difficult time getting entry level jobs than those without records – even in situations in which the potential employer doesn’t know the nature of the record (Criminological Highlights 6(3)#2)., This study investigates the impact of non-conviction records on employment.  Police, it seems, often keep records of contacts with citizens that do not lead to convictions; these records are disclosed, nevertheless, when ‘criminal record checks’ are required (see, for example, reports by the John Howard Society of Ontario http://www.johnhoward.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/johnhoward-ontari... and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association http://ccla.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/CCLA-NCD-Report.pdf ).  This study attempted to discover if those arrested but not charged “may still bear the mark of a criminal record” (p. 628).  Previous research (Criminological Highlights 14(3)#1) has shown that arrests not leading to a conviction are very common and that punishments are imposed on those who are arrested even if there is no finding of guilt., In this study, an experiment was carried out in which 300 applications were made, in person, to 150 employers for entry level jobs in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region.  The jobs required no special skills or licenses. Half of the applications were made by Black males in their 20’s; half were made by  comparable Whites.  In half of each group the applicant indicated to the potential employer that they “had been arrested, but never convicted of a misdemeanour offence.  It was minor and stupid on my part, and I wanted to be upfront about it in case it came up in a background check” (p. 633).  If they were asked about details they provided them, indicating that it was for a disorderly conduct misdemeanour, involving a fight… “Nobody was actually hurt.  I just acted irresponsibly, but I was young and that’s all in the past” (p. 633)., The results suggest that a misdemeanour arrest had, overall, a small, but statistically significant, impact on whether the person was called back for an interview (or was offered the job).  Those applying for the jobs noted, when they were in the workplace, whether there were non-white employees present in the workplace at the time of their application.  Using the presence of non-white employees as an indicator of workplace ‘diversity’, it seems that Blacks with arrest records applying for jobs in diverse workplaces were not disadvantaged by their records.  Why, then, was the effect of a misdemeanour arrest small?  In interviews carried out independently with employers,  3 reasons were noted. First, many employers made ‘personal’ rather than solely ‘on paper’ assessments of the job applicants.  Second, it seemed that many employers discounted the importance of the event leading to the arrest because of its minor, common nature.  Third, some employers clearly distinguished between arrests and convictions; and they interpreted the volunteering of an arrest record as showing good character., Conclusion:  When applying for entry level jobs, it would seem that people are slightly disadvantaged if they have a record of misdemeanour arrest.  However, the effect is not large.  Furthermore, the presence of an African-American in the workplace – which reduces the  size of the effect of a low level record for other African-American – suggests the possibility that these employers are familiar with the fact that these non-conviction records do not predict workplace behaviour., Reference: Uggen, Christopher, Mike Vuolo, Sarah Lageson, Ebony Ruhland, and Hilary K.

"Telling eyewitnesses that they have successfully identified a suspect who, in fact, is innocent, reduces the likelihood that, subsequently, they will be able to identify the correct suspect.",", When trying to identify a culprit in a criminal matter, police routinely will engage eyewitnesses in the process.  If, early in the investigation, police ask the witness to identify the culprit and the witness identifies the person whom the police suspect committed the crime, it would be perfectly natural for the police to thank the eyewitness and indicate that they think the eyewitness identified the right person.  This paper demonstrates that there are serious costs in doing so., Previous research has shown that post-identification feedback to witnesses that they have made the correct identification causes witnesses to alter their memories of key aspects of the identification process.  The feedback leads them to believe that they paid more attention to the actual culprit when they initially saw him and it makes them more certain that they identified the right person.  This paper shows that, in addition, such feedback makes it harder, subsequently, to identify the actual suspect if it turns out that the first person they identified was not the actual culprit., Participants in an experiment viewed a video of an airport scene in which one person switched luggage with another passenger and then left.   They were then shown 6 pictures of people.  The actual culprit was not included in the set.  They were asked to identify which was the culprit.  They were not explicitly given a choice of ‘not there.’  Everyone, as it turns out,  picked out someone from the array of 6 pictures.  The six pictures were all of people approximately the same age as the culprit.  However, half of the study participants received pictures of people who had been rated as being quite similar to one another.  The other half were shown 6 pictures of people who looked quite different from one another.   After identifying someone, the researcher said to half of the participants “Good job, you identified the suspect” (p. 287). The other participants were given no such feedback., The researcher then feigned having made a mistake, indicating that he had shown the participants the wrong lineup.  Participants were told to “disregard whatever you saw in the first lineup” (p. 287).  They were then given a new photo lineup which included the culprit and 5 others whom they had never seen., Giving feedback at the ‘early stage’ of the process that they had been right made it more difficult for witnesses to identify the actual culprit.  In the ‘no feedback’ conditions, 64% of the respondents were correct in identifying the culprit.  However, when they had previously been told that they were correct (when in fact they had identified an ‘innocent’ person), only 47% correctly identified the culprit.   In addition, those who made their original identifications from a group of people who were dissimilar from one another were less accurate, subsequently, in identifying the culprit., Conclusion:  Giving eyewitnesses feedback that they are correct in their identification is dangerous: if it turns out that the first culprit is quickly shown to be innocent (e.g., if other evidence turns up demonstrating that he could not have committed the offence), the witnesses’ ability to identify the actual culprit has been impaired, unnecessarily.  The results suggest not only that the police should not give positive feedback to eyewitnesses,  but also that mis-identifications from lineups with very dissimilar people in them are particularly likely to impair memory of the actual offender., Reference: Smalarz, Laura and Gary L.

Ontario bail courts are efficient at doing one thing: adjourning cases to be heard on a later date even though a “full days’ work” for these courts typically adds up to less than half a day.,"For most cases in which an accused is brought to court to determine if they should be released on bail, the law says that the onus is on the Crown to demonstrate the need to detain an accused person.  This observational study of 142 days of operation of 11 of Ontario’s bail courts demonstrates that almost half of those people who are brought to bail court do not get a decision at that hearing, notwithstanding the fact that courts are actively hearing cases for an average of only 3 hours and 15 minutes in a full court day., Part of the reason for this is that “There is no management structure or system of accountability in place to monitor the daily performance of the court” (p. 129). The court can best be thought of as an organization of different people (prosecutors, defence counsel, justices of the peace) with different interests.  What they hold in common is a desire to ‘get through the list’ of cases on the docket, not necessarily to make decisions., An average of about 30 cases are ‘heard’ each day but 53% of the 3376 cases that were observed as part of  this study ended the day simply being adjourned to another day (and often to different prosecutors and justices).  Most (81%) of the adjournments were requested – directly or indirectly – by defence counsel.  The remaining cases were equally likely to be initiated by the Crown and the Justice. Remarkably, however, since staff rotated into and out of the bail court “on a regular, if not daily basis”, there was nobody who seemed interested in “having the business of each appearance build on that of the previous appearance” (p. 137).  The result was that the likelihood of a decision being made concerning whether the accused should be detained or released was about 50% whether it was the first appearance in court for the accused or any subsequent appearance., Cases that were ready to proceed, however, did not always get heard.  Some courts would not allow contested hearings to be started after about 3 pm even though various people necessary for release had been waiting in court all day. One day, for example, a justice refused to allow a contested hearing even though the court had actively used only 3 hours and 12 minutes of a full court day (p. 140). On an average day, there were only 1.6 contested matters that were heard., Asking for adjournments was seldom controversial and was seldom challenged by anyone.  The reasons for adjournments were coded for the 2008 cases (of the 3376 cases that were observed).  17% occurred because defence counsel was not available.  In 16% of the cases a surety – a person willing to take responsibility for the accused person and to pay the court a specified sum if the accused person did not follow the terms of release – was not available on that day. There is no legal requirement for sureties though they are almost always required as a condition for release. There is also no legal requirement that they be examined in court though that is common practice. In 20% of the adjournment requests, the justification that was offered was the need for some court service or further information.  7% were adjourned because the court said it didn’t have the time to deal with the matter, and 16% were for other reasons (e.g., to plead guilty).  The acceptance of adjournments as a legitimate “outcome” is demonstrated by the fact that for the remaining 24% of cases, no reason was offered or requested., Conclusion: Large numbers of unproductive adjournments are common in many courts and are seen as a problem in some (see Criminological Highlights 4(6)#1, 9(4)#1). However, “bail court is unique in that all accused appearing in this court are in custody and will remain there until a bail decision is made” (p. 144). It appears that there is “a ‘culture of adjournment’ in which an adjournment is not only the most common way to deal with a case but is also the most accepted…. While court actors are certainly aware of issues of backlog and delay, there appears to be considerable ambivalence toward ensuring the bail decision is made expeditiously” (p. 145)., Reference: Myers, Nicole Marie (2015).

"In cities in which black Americans play important roles in city politics, there is no relationship between the percentage of blacks in a neighbourhood and the level of violent crime in that neighbourhood.  When black Americans are shut out of the political process, however, neighbourhoods with high concentrations of blacks also have high rates of violent crime.",", It is well established that in many cities in North America, rates of violence or homicide are higher in neighbourhoods with high concentrations of black residents.  This effect is reduced in strength, and sometimes disappears, when other factors – the level of neighbourhood disadvantage of residents or their access to other resources – are controlled for (see Criminological Highlights 14(2)#5, 6(4)#2)., This paper extends this research by examining the hypothesis that the political context of cities may help explain whether there is, or is not, a link between the racial makeup of a neighbourhood and its level of violent crime. Essentially it is suggested that “the association between percentage black and neighbourhood violence depends on the degree to which cities present favourable political context for blacks.” (p. 94).  “Forces beyond neighbourhood borders… shape the fate of local areas” (p. 94-5). There is a need to look at the city as a whole., Using data from 87 US cities, Black political opportunities were operationalized in a number of different ways: the election of black politicians (which can lead to increased black representation in city departments), black representation on the police force, the presence of a civilian police review board, and the receptivity to black issues (measured by voting Democratic).   Various other characteristics of the 87 cities and of the 8931 census tracts in these cities were examined including economic disadvantage, residential instability, the presence of manufacturing jobs, and the percent of the population that were young males., In general, before other factors were controlled for, the violent crime rate (homicides and robberies) was higher in neighbourhoods with high concentrations of black residents.  However, the strength of this relationship varied considerably across the 87 cities. When measures of neighbourhood disadvantage were controlled for, the effect of the percent black in the neighbourhood decreased but did not disappear., More important are the findings that break down the cities into those in which black citizens play a substantial political role and those in which they do not.  After including the economic and other controls, there is no relationship between the percent black in a neighbourhood and violent crime in cities with a black mayor.  In cities with a nonblack mayor, violence rates are higher in neighbourhoods with high concentrations of blacks. The results are similar when one looks at cities in which blacks are well represented among elected officials, or cities in which there are high concentrations of minority advocacy organizations.   Cities in which there are high rates of black political involvement do not show a relationship between the percent black in a neighbourhood and levels of violence.  Those in which black Americans are shut out of the political process do show a relationship between the percent black in a community and the neighbourhood violence rate., Conclusion: “Cities with favourable political environments [for black Americans]  typically nullify the effect of percentage black on violent crime at the neighbourhood level…. These results challenge cultural stereotypes that [link] black neighbourhoods inevitably to violence….  Black political opportunities and mobilization [may] help reduce or offset the effects of disadvantages that neighbourhoods with greater percentages of blacks often otherwise face” (p. 110)., Reference: Vélez, María B., Christopher J.

Putting extra resources into the policing of high crime areas isn’t enough.  To reduce violent crime police need to focus their attention on specific individuals who were known or suspected to be involved in violent crimes – an approach that can be carried out without an increase in the indiscriminate stopping and questioning of ordinary residents.,", There is some evidence that increased police presence in high crime areas can have some impact on crime, although the effects may be short-lived. Other research suggests that what the police do when policing a high crime area may be the key to understanding these effects on crime ‘hot spots’ (see Criminological Highlights 12(3)#3, 14(5)#3, 13(3)#2)., This study examined the impact of three different police tactics designed to reduce the incidence of violent crime in high crime areas. 27 areas (with an average of 3 miles of streets and 23.5 intersections) with high levels of violent crime were identified by the police as being appropriate for each of the three experimental treatments. 20 were randomly assigned to receive the treatment; 7 were randomly assigned to be policed as they always had been., One third of the experimental areas were assigned to receive foot patrols for a minimum of 8 hours per day, 5 days a week. Typically officers patrolled in pairs.  In another set of areas, officers were encouraged to engage in ‘problem-oriented policing’ and were given special training for this.  The actual activities of these officers varied from area to area. In another set of areas, police officers engaged in ‘offender-focused policing’ in which residents of the area suspected or known to engage in repeat violence were identified by the police intelligence unit.  Police officers made contact with these people or, in some cases, served arrest warrants for recently committed offences. More commonly, the police simply exercised surveillance on these people., Each policing tactic was implemented for a minimum of 12 weeks and a maximum of 24 weeks.  Violent crime in all areas (experimental and control) was monitored for 38 weeks.  The “offender focused” approach caused a reduction in violent crime in the experimental areas of about 42%.  Analyses of changes in crime in adjacent areas suggest that there was no displacement of violent crime to these areas.  If anything, there was a reduction in violent crime in adjacent areas suggesting a “diffusion of crime-control benefits” (p. 42)., Neither the problem-oriented policing nor the foot patrols had significant impacts on violent crime. In fact, it was very difficult for police officers to implement the problem-oriented policing tactics.  Even though the areas had been chosen because they were relatively high in violent crime, police officers reported that in many of the areas citizens did not see violent crime as the biggest local problem., In the “offender focused” areas, there was no increase in the number of pedestrian stops, car stops, or narcotics incidents.  This suggests that if the police have a specific set of individuals to watch, they will not bother those not on their list.  This is a very different approach, then, from ‘saturation patrols’ in which ordinary people are indiscriminately stopped and questioned or in which people are arrested for minor (e.g., drug possession) offences., Conclusion: A focus by the police on people known or suspected of involvement in serious violence appears to be an effective use of police resources in reducing violent crime.  Furthermore, it can be done without the negative impact of increased use of stops of ordinary citizens. “By focusing police efforts on the problem people associated with the problem places, police can achieve significant crime reductions while avoiding negative community perceptions of their actions” (p. 46)., Reference: Groff, Elizabeth R.

"People who have served on juries do not think that judges are out of touch with the public on sentencing.  When they see the sentence that the judge handed down in ‘their’ case, they are even less likely to think that judges are out of touch.",", Previous research has demonstrated that jurors who thought that sentences generally were too lenient were quite likely to approve of the sentence handed down in cases in which they determined the finding of guilt (Criminological Highlights 11(6)#2).  This study looks in more detail at whether jurors think that sentencing judges, generally, are out of touch with public opinion on sentencing., Jurors from 162 trials in Tasmania, Australia, in which a verdict of guilty was returned were asked – after they had rendered their verdict but before they heard the sentence that the judge imposed in the case they had heard – “How in touch do you think judges are with public opinion on sentencing?” (p. 732).  In clear contrast to surveys of ordinary Australians that show the most Australians believe that judges are not in touch with what ordinary people think about sentencing,  71% of  Tasmanian jurors thought that judges are very (12.4%)  or somewhat (58.2%)  in touch with public opinion on sentencing., After the sentence was handed down in the case that they heard,  jurors were sent a package of material including the sentence and the judge’s comments about the sentence as well as information about crime and sentencing.  They were then asked to fill out and return a second questionnaire.  This questionnaire included the same question concerning their views of whether judges were out of touch with the public on sentencing. 82% of the jurors, in this second round of questioning, thought that judges were very (26%) or somewhat (56%) in touch with the public on sentencing.  In other words, after the experience of jury service, more people overall (82% vs. 71%) thought that judges were in touch with the public on sentencing, and about twice as many (26% vs 12%)thought that judges were very in touch with the public on sentencing matters., Both before they knew the actual sentence and after they heard about the sentence in the case they had heard, they were asked whether they thought that sentences were generally too lenient for four categories of offences (sex, violence, property, and drugs).   Respondents were less likely to think that sentences for all four types of cases were too lenient after they had heard the judge’s sentence in ‘their’ case than before.  However, this effect appeared to be determined largely by those who thought that judges were in touch with ordinary people’s views on sentencing.  Not surprisingly, those who thought that judges were out of touch with ordinary people’s views on sentencing were more likely to think that sentences were too lenient., Conclusion: Jurors, generally, made favourable comments about the judges, though many differentiated their experience with ‘their’ particular judge from what they believed to be the case for judges generally.  Clearly jurors from the 162 trials believed that the judge presiding over their trial not only handed down an appropriate sentence, but was in touch with what the public thought about sentencing.  This study,  along with other findings on public opinion toward sentencing,  suggests that before the public’s stated view that ‘sentences are too lenient’ is blindly followed, it should be remembered that it is the public that is not ‘in touch’ with what is actually going on in court. In large part, ordinary members of the public seldom have the kind of information about cases that jurors are exposed to., Reference: Warner, Kate, Julia Davis, Maggie Walter, and Caroline Spiranovic (2014).

Sequential presentations of lineups used by police in actual cases are more effective than simultaneous presentations of lineups.  Fewer incorrect identifications are made and there is no reduction in the rate of identification of the actual suspect.,", Police lineups using photographs can be run in two different ways. A picture of a suspect can be placed in an array of photographs of non-suspects and the array of photographs is then shown simultaneously to the witness.  Alternatively, the individual pictures are shown sequentially to the witness with the witness making a decision for each photograph about whether it represents the person they saw. Typically witnesses do not know how many pictures they will be shown in these sequential lineups. Hence ‘absolute’ judgements are made rather than ‘relative’ judgements (as might be the case in a simultaneous lineup)., Laboratory research – typically involving people who witnessed a simulated crime – suggest strongly that sequential lineups lead to more correct and fewer incorrect identifications (see Criminological Highlights 12(4)#6). A 2011 survey of US police services found that 32% of them use sequential lineups.  This study takes that research one important step further. In actual criminal cases in 4 police jurisdictions,  witnesses were randomly assigned to view lineups presented either sequentially or simultaneously., The four police services implemented an experiment in a manner that attempted to ensure that any differences in the outcome were due to the simultaneous vs. sequential manipulation.  The “filler” pictures along with the suspect’s picture were chosen by detectives (who did not know which type of lineup would eventually be presented). The pictures were then imported into a computer and placed in a random order, except that the actual suspect was never in Position 1 (for either type of lineup).  A second detective, not involved in the creation of the lineup and who did not know who the actual suspect was,  conducted the lineup using a laptop computer.  The computer randomly determined which type of lineup was to be presented once all instructions had been presented (e.g., that the suspect may or may not be in the lineup, etc.).  A computer program largely instructed the witnesses and ran the lineup.  Witnesses who viewed the sequential lineup were allowed to repeat the presentation if they asked to do so and were told that they would have as much time as they wanted.  They were also told that if they identified a person early in the procedure they should still look at the full series of pictures., In all, 494 lineups were carried out, about half sequential and half simultaneous.  In about a quarter of the lineups the suspect was identified. This rate was essentially the same for simultaneous and sequential lineups.  Of course, unlike the simulated crimes used in laboratory studies, it was not known whether the suspect was in fact the person whom the eyewitness saw.  A “filler” was identified as the offender in 11.1% of the cases on the first presentation of the sequential lineup and in 12.3% in either the first or second presentation.  In the simultaneous lineups, a filler was incorrectly identified in 17.8% of cases., Conclusion: “Although the results showed an advantage for the sequential lineup procedure overall in reducing the rate of known (filler) errors, it is also clear that the differences were small” (p. 10).  Generally, however, the results are similar to the laboratory studies.  They may be weaker because there is more variation across lineups (e.g., on whether the actual suspect is in the lineup, the time between the witnessed event and the lineup, as well as variation in the original viewing of the crime).  These factors, however, did not differ systematically across the lineup conditions since eyewitnesses were randomly assigned to one of the presentation styles.  Nevertheless, the findings confirm earlier laboratory research suggesting that there are clear advantages, and no disadvantages, of using a sequential lineup procedure rather than a simultaneous presentation of a lineup., Reference: Wells, Gary L., Nancy K. Steblay, and Jennifer E.

Canada’s system of pardons for ordinary offences was designed to reduce the stigma of a criminal conviction.  Recent legislative changes were designed to undermine this purpose.,", In 1970, when Canada’s pardon legislation was introduced, the main Canadian political parties were in agreement with its overall purpose.  Pardons were seen as a mechanism to reintegrate offenders back into society.  480,035 pardons have been issued since 1970. Only 5% of them have been revoked., Recently, however, the Canadian government made changes in the legislation. The triggering events that the government used to justify the changes to the pardon related to two high profile offenders.  One had received a pardon and was later found to have committed other offences decades before the pardon was issued. The other, a high profile offender, was approaching the time when she would have been eligible to apply for a pardon., The legislation eliminated the word “pardon” from the law. Some of those with criminal convictions can now apply for “record suspensions” reflecting, apparently, the Government’s view that those who have committed criminal offences should no longer be pardoned or forgiven for what they have done. As one Government spokesperson put it, “A pardon suggests that everything is now OK” (p. 222)., In addition, those guilty of certain offences (e.g., certain sex offences) or patterns of offences, are never eligible for pardons. The waiting time for applications increased from 3 to 5 years for less serious offences and from 5 to 10 years for more serious offences. No empirical justification was offered.  Finally the application fee was raised from $50 to $150 and then to $631 on the theory, according to the government minister, that “ordinary Canadians shouldn’t be having to foot the bill for a criminal asking for a pardon” (p. 222)., Using data from an organization that helps those applying for pardons complete the application, it would appear women are very slightly over-represented among pardon applicants compared to those found guilty in court (22% vs. 16%).   Compared to those found guilty in courts, those receiving pardons are considerably more likely to have been found guilty of a drinking-driving offence (33% vs. 14%) or a property offence (35% vs. 22%) and much less likely to have been found guilty of an administration of justice offence (0% vs. 25%).  They were equally likely to have been found guilty of a violent offence (19%)., Unlike those found guilty in court, about half were age 45 or older. Most (82%) were employed and the vast majority were applying because of work related issues (71%). A sizable number, however, were applying because of matters of conscience (15%) or so that they could do volunteer work (14%).   These latter two purposes were mentioned disproportionately by those over age 45 and by those who had waited a long time after becoming eligible for a pardon.  In effect, then, those applying for pardons “were convicted of ordinary, relatively minor types of offences and they desired a pardon for… employment purposes, or simply to clear their conscience of a mistake, or to be able to volunteer… exactly what was envisioned – and hoped for – by the drafters of the original pardons bill introduced in 1970” (p. 220)., Conclusion: The original legislation was designed to deal with a problem inherent in criminal convictions identified by the opposition (Conservative) party in Parliament in 1970.  As they put it, it was “absolutely unfair for a person to carry on his shoulders for a lifetime, something which was done perhaps on the spur of the moment.”  The pardon legislation, as it operated for about 40 years, appeared to be working quite well.  Nevertheless, the government of Canada decided,  without empirical justification, to restrict the availability of pardons., Reference: Murphy, Yoko, Jane B.

"For an asylum seeker, having a good lawyer can increase the likelihood of success in part because good lawyers know how to tailor their arguments for specific immigration judges.  Having a bad lawyer, however, is worse than having no lawyer at all.",", People applying for asylum in the US are classic “one shot” players in court faced with the “repeat player” federal government. It is suggested here that “high capability legal counsel is able to even the odds in this type of litigation between one-shot litigant asylum seekers and the repeat player federal government” (p. 210). Applicants for asylum must demonstrate “a well-founded fear of persecution” (p. 210).  However, “the legal strictures in asylum cases are loose because both the facts and the law are vague” (p. 210)., This paper examines the outcome of 197,704 US asylum cases between 1990 and 2010 involving 1,234 different lawyers or law firms.  Various measures of lawyer capability (including past successes in asylum cases) and their success with particular immigration judges (IJ) were developed. Various other controls were included such as a measure of judicial liberalism (based on background characteristics of the IJ), characteristics of the country of origin, year in which application was heard, and party in power at a national level., The results suggest that having a lawyer who specializes in immigration law does not affect the likelihood of a successful outcome, nor does the lawyer’s overall experience with immigration law (measured by the number of cases the lawyer has taken). Indeed, “increased experience appears to reduce the likelihood of victory” (p. 227). “As the case load of an immigration lawyer increases, the likelihood of securing relief for any given client decreases” (p. 228).  To some extent this may be the result of the fact that many one-case or low volume  lawyers in the sample are pro-bono lawyers working in other areas of law, who are working with other organizations., “Being unrepresented appears to make one more likely to receive relief than being represented by a poor attorney….  [However] the average attorney is about 9 percentage points better than no attorney (p. 228).  These effects hold for clients coming from countries of all levels of human rights oppression., Not surprisingly, those who have been successful in the past with asylum cases are likely to be successful in the case that they are handling.  More interesting is the fact that “an attorney that has previously won every case before a specific IJ is 64 percentage points more likely to prevail than an attorney who has never won before a particular IJ” (p. 228) even when overall success is held constant., It is suggested that “A large component of attorney success is found in being able to tailor an argument to a specific IJ, perhaps knowing and playing on their proclivities…. In immigration court it is not just mere experience before a judge, but rather having past experience in winning cases before a judge” (p. 230).  The data suggest that “there is a great deal of nuance in the relationships between attorneys and IJs, a relationship that is perhaps enhanced by the harried nature of asylum decision making: IJs are left to rely heavily on the ability of attorneys to develop cases, given their extreme workloads” (p. 232)., Conclusion: It is clear that good representation at immigration asylum hearings can level the playing field between the applicant and the government.  However, given that poor representation is worse for the applicant than having no lawyer at all, one needs to be cautious about any policy suggestion that simply provides “lawyers” of any quality on the assumption that ‘some’ support is better than none., Reference: Banks, Miller, Linda Camp Keith, and Jennifer S.

An analysis of all known treatment programs for drug-abusing offenders in Europe that have relatively adequate evaluations demonstrates that programs that include pharmacological substitution treatments were quite effective. Programs that relied primarily on drug testing were ineffective.,", It is quite clear from a number of studies that substance abuse and crime are linked: drug abuse is common among prisoners and the likelihood of offending is considerably higher among those using illegal drugs than it is in the general population.  Not surprisingly, therefore, correctional authorities often provide drug treatment programs., What is more surprising is how little is known, on a systematic basis, about the relative value of various forms of drug treatment programs.  In large part, this is the result of the failure of correctional authorities to do high quality evaluations. Equally often, drug programs are implemented in a manner that does not permit a ‘no treatment’ or ‘treatment as usual’ comparison group., This paper presents a systematic review of European studies (published and unpublished, and written in any European language) on drug treatment programs where crime reduction was one of the measured goals.  Only studies that include a demonstrated equivalence between treatment and control groups were included. There had to be, as well, some measure of subsequent offending (self-report or criminal justice).  Over 30 thousand studies were initially identified of which 1422 passed an initial screening (on such factors as the presence of a comparison group).  In the end, however, there were only 13 studies with 15 controlled evaluations (involving 1698 people in the drug treatment program) that met the selection criteria.  Most programs, clearly, are not adequately evaluated., Twelve of these 15 studies involved primarily substitution-based treatment, often combined with various psychological or psychosocial treatments, client supervision and drug testing.  The remaining 3 studies focused primarily on the effectiveness in reducing crime of criminal justice-based drug testing orders.  In the pharmacological substitution studies, the form of the treatments varied considerably as did the frequency of contact between the client and the clinic delivering the treatment.  The control groups were typically “treatment-as-usual.”  For example, for opiate-dependent populations in many European countries, methadone maintenance treatment is the conventional program; hence this was often the ‘treatment-as-usual’ condition., There were significant positive improvements associated with the treatment on various physical health measures.  “Pharmacological substitution treatments [showed] particularly strong… effects on both crime and illicit drug use” (p. 593).  Programs based on drug-testing, however, did not demonstrate significant effects on either crime or drug use. It would appear that, on average, re-offending rates dropped by about 37% with the substitution drug treatment., Conclusion: It would appear that the European drug treatment programs may have a larger effect on reoffending than studies carried out elsewhere.  This may have to do with the fact that the effective treatments in this review involved pharmacological substitution.  The necessity of adequate control groups was also demonstrated by the fact that, over time, in most of these studies, there was a reduction in drug use in both the treatment and the control groups.  A simple “before – after” design, without a control group would therefore have been inadequate since any program, even ones that had no effect, would demonstrate ‘change’ in these circumstances., Reference: Koehler, Johann A., David K.

Bail conditions placed on youths released pending trial do not have their intended effects.,"Canada’s 2003 Youth Criminal Justice Act is credited with reducing the number of youths sent to youth court as well as reducing the number of custodial sentences imposed on young people who commit offences (Criminological Highlights 10(1)#1,  10(3)#1). Nevertheless, concerns about the operation of the Act remain., Specifically, it appears that there are problems with the operation of pretrial release (Criminological Highlights 13(1)#1, 12(5)#3, 13(5)#5).   This paper addresses a straightforward question: Do multiple bail conditions imposed on youths awaiting trial accomplish the goals that justify their imposition: appearing for court as required and refraining from committing additional offences while awaiting trial., When Canadian bail courts release youths into the community prior to their trial, they often place large numbers of conditions on them, some of which bear almost no relationship to the current charge (Criminological Highlights 13(5)#5).  Ontario justices of the peace appear to subscribe to the theory that more conditions will lead to better behaviour., Using data from one of the largest youth courts in Ontario (Canada), this paper examined court records from a representative sample of 358 cases from 2009-2011 in which the youth was released on bail awaiting trial.  Justices imposed a median of 8 (mean = 7.6 conditions) separate distinct bail conditions on these youths.  The impact of the number of these conditions was examined on three outcome measures.  The first was whether the youth was charged with “failure to appear” in court.  Youths had many opportunities not to appear: cases generally consumed between 2 and 37 court appearances (mean 12.4) with one outlying case in which the youth was required to appear in court 65 times. 63% of the youths were required to appear at least 10 times (typically on school days).  The second outcome measure was whether there were new substantive charges laid against the youth. Finally, the number of “failure to comply with a court order” charges were examined., The main independent variable of interest was the number of conditions placed on the youth who was awaiting trial. Only 3 of the youths were charged with failure to appear in court.  Hence, there was no evidence that large numbers of conditions served to ensure court appearance, since those with relatively few conditions also appeared., Two background factors predicted whether the youth was returned to court for new substantive offences (i.e., offences other than ‘administration of justice’ offences): their current charge and whether they had been facing charges before the bail hearing in which the conditions were imposed. In addition, boys were more likely than girls to be returned for new offences.  However, there was absolutely no evidence that the number of bail conditions had any impact on subsequent substantive charges., However, consistent with previous research, those with large numbers of bail conditions were more likely to be returned to court with new charges for ‘failure to comply with a court order.’  In other words, by placing large numbers of conditions on their release, the court was successful in ensuring that youths would fail, even when gender and previous charges before the court were taken into account., Conclusion: Youth bail conditions are not accomplishing the goals that justify their imposition. Placing large numbers of conditions on youths does not have an impact on attending court or on whether a youth commits new substantive offenses.  It does, however, increase the likelihood of administration of justice charges. “What release conditions can end up doing, then, is criminalizing the risks or vulnerabilities youths have, under the [false] assumption that simple criminalization is sufficient to produce behavioural change” (p. 74)., Reference: Sprott, Jane B. and Jessica Sutherland (2015).

"People who believe that the police act unfairly are likely to believe that it is all right for ordinary people to use violence for personal protection, to resolve disputes, or to achieve political goals.",", Previous research has suggested that “when police act in line with the norms and values of procedural justice, members of the public tend to believe that the police have the right to [use force]” (p. 479).  This study examines whether there are “empirical links between how the police [are seen to] exercise their authority (procedural justice)… and whether those [who are subject to the police] believe it is acceptable to use violence to achieve certain social and political goals” (p. 480)., Studies have suggested that those who perceive the justice system to be more legitimate are more likely to comply with the law, cooperate with the police, and support the police in their exercise of their power (Criminological Highlights, 4(4)#1, 7(1)#4, 11(4)#1, 12(5)#2).   This study examines whether those who see the police as acting in a legitimate manner “also believe that one should not use violence to achieve certain goals – that is that the police have a right and just monopoly over violence in society” (p. 481)., The study was carried out in 4 boroughs of  London, England. Within each of these locations, males, age 16-30 “self-identifying as members of a non-majority ethnic or racial group” (p. 483) were sampled.  The acceptability of three types of violence was assessed: violence to protect oneself from attack or intruders, violence to resolve disputes or take revenge, and violence for political goals.  In addition, trust in the fairness of the police, belief in the effectiveness of the police, and belief in the legitimacy of the police were assessed.  Finally, fear of crime, feelings of belonging in Britain, and attitudes toward democracy were included along with various demographic measures and experiences with police stops., Controlling for all other measured factors, “the study’s core finding is that [perceived] procedural justice explains variation in police legitimacy, which in turn is negatively correlated with attitudes to [all three types of] private violence (p. 486).  In other words, the relationship of procedural justice to the acceptability of violence appears to be indirect – by its impact on the perceived legitimacy of the police.  This suggests the more people perceive the police to be acting legitimately “via compliance with standards of procedural justice, the less favourable are people’s views about the acceptability of private violence” (p. 486).  There is little evidence that judgments of police effectiveness are related to attitudes concerning the legitimacy of using private violence.  Independent of these effects, “A positive view of democracy and feelings of belonging to the nation are negatively correlated with approval of political violence” (p. 486)., Conclusion: Consistent with previous research, this study found that perceptions of the legitimacy of the police are correlated with perceptions that the police act in a procedurally fair manner.   Those who see the police as acting with legitimacy, then, are less likely to support the use of violence for personal protection, to resolve disputes, or to achieve political goals.  Although causal statements cannot be drawn from these correlational results, the findings underline the likely importance of police acting in a manner that elicits perceptions that they are acting in a procedurally fair manner., Reference: Jackson, Jonathan, Aziz Z.

"Focusing resources on helping former prisoners locate, gain, and retain reasonably paid employment can reduce subsequent offending.",", Although work programs for ex-prisoners are often believed to be useful for reducing subsequent offending, the data suggest that they may not reduce offending for some groups. This paper looks at an unusual employment assistance program for prisoners: one that begins in prison but provides a full year of community support after the prisoner is released., In this program, prisoners who have voluntarily acquired work experience and skills in Minnesota’s state prison industry programs and who have a clean discipline record meet with a job training specialist for at least 16 hours prior to release. One week before release, a specialist begins searching for jobs that meet the prisoner’s skills and are in the location where he is expected to live.  The potential employer is informed of the prisoner’s criminal background.  When the prisoner is released, a job retention specialist meets with him, helps him with job leads (and helps the former prisoner with transportation costs to the interviews and obtaining appropriate clothing).  Regular meetings are scheduled thereafter throughout the year., The program ran between July 2006 and December 2008.  In order to create a comparable group of prisoners who had not participated in the program, propensity score matching was used.  This technique matches those who did and did not participate on the basis of a statistical prediction of whether a person is likely to be in the program.  In other words, prisoners were located who – using a wide range of predictors – look similar to those who participated in the employment program.  The predictors included 26 variables such as LSI-R scores (a risk assessment tool), the LSI education/employment score, sex, race, age, time employed in prison, prior convictions, prior supervision failures, offence type, institutional discipline record, education, length of stay in prison. There were 232 prisoners who participated in the program who had adequate data for the matching procedure.  Matches were found for them from the 3959 prisoners who had participated in prison work but not in the employment program., The main dependent variables were rearrest, reconviction, reincarceration or revocation for a violation of a condition of release. Those who participated in the program had lower rates of recidivism on all four of these measures.  The data show that they reoffended less, and were in the community longer before reoffending than those who were equivalent but had not participated in the employment program.   Not surprisingly, those who participated in the program were also more likely to be employed than those who were released at roughly the same time but did not participate in the program.  Those in the special program worked more hours, but their hourly wage (when employed) did not differ from those who did not participate in the program., Conclusion:  This employment program may have worked to reduce reoffending by those released from prison because “providing a continuum of care from prison to community is critical in helping [former prisoners] successfully re-enter society…. [The program] provides post release employment assistance to offenders while they are in the institution but also during the first year after they get released from prison” (p. 582).  In addition, of course, the positive results could reflect the fact that a non-trivial amount of focused time was spent attempting to help former prisoners reintegrate effectively., Reference: Duwe, Grant (2015).  The Benefits of Keeping Idle Hands Busy: An Outcome Evaluation of a Prisoner Reentry Employment Program.  Crime & Delinquency, 61(4), 559-586., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV15N3.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-15-no-3-%E2%80%93-september-2015,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 15, No. 3 – September 2015",Regular Issue,2015
"Prison overcrowding litigation in the United States between 1971 and 1996 had no impact on prison admissions, release rates, or prison crowding.",", In a number of areas, it has been suggested that “organizations blunt the impact of regulations and lawsuits by shaping judicial conceptions of what counts as legal compliance in ways that are aligned with professional and organizational interests” (p. 402).  “Regardless of what measures are taken, compliance is likely to remain symbolic” (p. 407). This paper examines this idea in the context of prison overcrowding litigation., Formal adherence to court ordered reduction in prison overcrowding could occur in three ways: lowering the admission rate, releasing prisoners earlier, or building more prisons.  There was, however, “considerable political inertia against prison construction in the 1970s and 1980s, despite widespread support for getting tough on crime” (p. 405).  Part of this has to do with the fact that local people (e.g., locally elected prosecutors) are responsible for sending people to prison but states are responsible for prisons.  In addition, little political support is garnered for doing something ‘good’ for prisoners such as reducing overcrowding.  For corrections officials, however, increased spending on prison construction might be seen as a favourable outcome for various reasons including the possibility that less overcrowding makes it easier for them to maintain order and control., This study uses data from 49 states from 1971 to 1996 (when federal law came into effect that limited the ability of courts to intervene in crowding cases). During this period, there were 80 overcrowding cases (in 41 states).  The impact of these cases was assessed against year-over-year change in five measures: prison admissions rates, prison release rates, per capita capital spending on prisons, the incarceration rate, and prison crowding (measured as the ratio of the average daily population to a prison system’s rated capacity).   Control variables included two measures of Republican political power (a Republican governor and control of the legislature), interparty competition (how evenly split the legislature was), unemployment rate, racial threat (% black), and fiscal capacity (per capita income and ratio of state revenues to debt)., Prison litigation did not appear to be followed by either a reduction in prison admissions or an increase in release rates.  In the first two years after court action, spending on prison construction increased. However, “overcrowding litigation had no impact on its intended target, prison crowding” (p. 424).  Although there was no direct impact of litigation on incarceration rates, “increased capital outlay spending [the result of overcrowding litigation] is associated with increased incarceration rates 4 years later” (p. 425)., Conclusion: State officials, it seems, responded to overcrowding litigation not by adjusting admissions and release rates, but by increasing prison capacity, “since this response was the only one in line with both the professional interests of correctional officials and political interests of state leaders during this period” (p. 426).  Successful overcrowding litigation, often brought by those wanting to reduce the use of prison, is not enough.  The fact that “overcrowding litigation had no discernible impact on prison overcrowding  while also contributing to the expansion of prison capacity” is ironic because many of those bringing behind the litigation  “hoped that state decision makers would embrace less costly, non-custodial alternatives when forced to bear the cost of maintaining constitutional prisons. Instead, their efforts appear to have had nearly the opposite of the intended effects” (p. 427)., Reference: Guetzkow, Joshua and Eric Schoon (2015).  If You Build It, They Will Fill It: The Consequences of Prison Overcrowding Litigation.

"Having a criminal record directly impacts the ability of people to obtain housing, even when those with records are forthright and tell potential landlords about their backgrounds.",", It is well established that men – especially black men – with prison records in America will have considerably more difficulty in obtaining entry level jobs than will those who have never been incarcerated.  In fact, records of arrests by police not leading to convictions also make it difficult to get a job. (Criminological Highlights 6(3)#2, 15(1)#7).  Getting a job is not the only difficulty facing those who have had contact with the criminal justice system., People released from prison often need, almost immediately, to find a stable place to live.  For some offenders – most notably sex offenders – society often imposes special residence restrictions on where they can live that cannot be justified empirically (Criminological Highlights 8(6)#5, 11(4)#7, 7(4)#4, 12(2)#5).  This study extends the investigation of the special hurdles facing those with criminal records in finding a place to live., Advertisements for apartment rentals in New York state with listed rents of $1500 or less were located on internet sites such as Craigslist. An attempt was made to choose only those where the telephone contact person was the landlord or owner rather than a real estate broker.  Each landlord was called twice. One call was from a person who did not mention having a criminal record.  In the other call (the order of the calls was random), the person mentioned being on parole and that their parole officer required them to mention that they had a criminal record.  The criminal record was described as being for child molestation, statutory rape or drug trafficking.  The tester than asked the landlord, in those conditions in which the tester had said that he or she had a criminal record,  “Would my conviction be a problem for renting the apartment? Would you still be able to show me the apartment?” (p. 29).  In the other condition, the tester simply asked whether they could make an appointment to see the apartment., Prospective tenants without a criminal record received agreement from 96% of the landlords to view the apartment.  Those with a criminal record were only able to get the landlord to agree to show them the apartment in 43% of the cases. The criminal record had similar effects for both male and female testers.  Landlords rejected those with criminal records either directly (e.g., by mentioning that there were children nearby) or by simply saying that they would have to check with others.  Follow-up calls from the tester to these landlords went unanswered., Landlords were equally willing to follow up and consider the rental request with male and female testers who did not have criminal records.  However, of those with a criminal record, males were less likely than females to have the landlord say that they could see the apartment (39% of the cases with a male tester with a criminal record received a positive reply compared to 48% for females).   Testers who said that their criminal conviction was for child molestation were less likely than those who described their convictions as either drug trafficking or statutory rape to be offered an opportunity to view the apartment.  Male landlords were more likely to show an apartment to a potential tenant with a criminal record than were female landlords., Conclusion:  It is clear that people with criminal records face special challenges in renting apartments, whether their record is for a drug offence or a sexual offence.  In fact, having a criminal record cut by half the likelihood that a person applying to rent an apartment would even get a chance to see the apartment.  Given that people released from prison have to live somewhere, and given the evidence that recidivism rates are lower if they do not return to the neighbourhoods they lived in before being sent to prison (Criminological Highlights 10(5)#1), it would appear that restrictions are, from a public safety perspective, counterproductive., Reference: Evans, Douglas N., and Jeremy R.

"When being sentenced in US state courts, Asian-Americans – who are often viewed as “model minorities” (e.g., educationally and economically successful) – are less likely to receive a prison sentence than are comparable Black, White, and Hispanic offenders.",", If Black and Hispanic offenders are sometimes treated more harshly at sentencing than White offenders because Blacks and Hispanics are seen as being more prone to involvement in crime, then Asian-American offenders should be less likely than White Americans to be treated harshly since, as a group, Asian-Americans are seen as less likely to be involved in crime., One theory about the manner in which judges arrive at difficult sentencing decisions is that they are influenced by at least two ‘focal concerns’: the blameworthiness of the offender and protection of the community.  Judgements about these matters may be guided, in part, by a kind of ‘perceptual shorthand’ based not only on case characteristics but also stereotypes that “identify different groups as being more or less crime prone and dangerous” (p. 98).   This study examines whether Asian-Americans might benefit from this perceptual shorthand., Detailed state court felony sentencing data from 9,384 cases from 7 cities in 3 states between 1996 and 2004 were examined.  The main dependent variable was the decision to incarcerate or not.  Those who were sentenced were identified as White, Black, Hispanic or Asian.  (Unfortunately, the study was not able to examine differences across sub-groups of any of these racial groups.) Other factors known to affect sentencing decisions were controlled statistically: sex, age, offence, number of charges, criminal history, whether the offender had a previous failure to appear, whether the offender was under some form of criminal justice control at the time of the arrest, whether there was a guilty plea, and whether the accused was represented by a private lawyer., Many of the control variables (e.g., criminal history, number of charges, etc.) predicted whether an offender received a prison sentence.  But above and beyond these factors, Asian-American offenders were less likely to receive prison sentences than whites.  Hispanics were more likely to receive prison sentences than Whites.  Black Americans were equally likely to receive prison sentences as Whites (after number of charges, criminal history, whether they were under some form of criminal justice control, and presence of a prior failure to appear were controlled)., Conclusion: Though before controls were included, Black Americans were more likely to be incarcerated than Whites, this effect disappeared when case controls were included.  However, the increased likelihood of incarceration of Hispanics and decreased likelihood of incarceration of Asian-Americans remained even after the various control variables were included in the analysis. These two effects are consistent with the theory that judges base their judgements, in part, on stereotypes about whether the offender comes from a group that is crime prone and dangerous.  Sentence length decisions, once controls were included, did not show any differences among racial groups., Reference: Franklin, Travis W. and Noelle E.

"When violent crime decreased in the United States, it appears to have decreased both in neighbourhoods with high and low crime.  However, the biggest changes were in the high crime neighbourhoods.",", Since the early 1990s, crime rates have decreased in the US and in various other countries (including Canada).  The decreases are evident in various measures of crime.  However, given that violent crime appears to be concentrated in certain neighbourhoods (Criminological Highlights 14(2)#5, 14(3)#5), it is important to know whether these high crime neighbourhoods also benefitted from the drop in crime.  Did the crime drop exacerbate neighbourhood differences in crime rates, maintain these differences, or decrease the differences between ‘high’ and ‘low’ crime neighbourhoods?, To better understand the impact of the ‘crime drop’ on neighbourhood violence rates, police-reported crime data in neighbourhoods in 6 American cities – Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, Philadelphia, St. Petersburg Florida, and Seattle – were examined for periods of at least 10 years beginning between 1990 and 2001 and ending between 2007 and 2012.  Neighbourhoods were defined as census tracts for all cities except Denver (in which crime rates in somewhat larger neighbourhoods were examined).   The absolute drop in crime in the initially most violent 20% of city neighbourhoods could then be compared to the size of the crime drop in the remaining neighbourhood in each city., In the cities in which there was an overall drop in violent crime (during any specific 10 to 20 year period), the drop in violent crime was considerably larger in the high crime neighbourhoods.    The result of this, of course, is that high crime neighbourhoods during these periods of change became less distinctive (in their rates of violent crime) from the rest of the city.  In other words, the difference in crime rates between high and low crime neighbourhoods decreased when crime, overall, decreased., Another consequence of this differential decrease in crime is that those who lived in relatively poor neighbourhoods (the poorest 20%) also experienced the largest crime drops.  “For example, the decline was more than 120 [violent] crimes per 10,000 residents in Seattle’s poor [census] tracts, compared with only about 15 crimes per 10,000 residents elsewhere” (p. 348).  In cities with neighbourhoods that had a majority of black residents “the absolute decline in violent crime in majority-black neighbourhoods far exceeded that in majority-white neighbourhoods.  For instance, Chicago’s majority-black neighbourhoods experienced a decline of 74 violent crimes per 10,000 residents, versus 19 per 10,000 in its majority-white tracts” (p. 349)., At the same time, it should be noted that “there is a very strong correlation between the initial and final violent crime rates of the neighbourhoods in each city” (p. 353). In other words, neighbourhoods with higher crime rates in the early 1990s also had higher crime rates in the early 2000s., Conclusion: The problem of violence in cities is not equally distributed across neighbourhoods, “but rather was concentrated within a small segment of neighbourhoods that were characterized by racial and ethnic segregation and poverty” (p. 354-5).  These, however, were the neighbourhoods that disproportionately became less violent when crime dropped from 1990 onwards.  “The decline of violent crimes in these 6 cities served to ameliorate, but not to eliminate, socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in community violence” (p. 355).   Exactly why crime declined so precipitously in these areas, however, is not clear., Reference: Friedson, Michael, and Patrick Sharkey (2015) Violence and Neighbourhood Disadvantage after the Crime Decline.  Annals, AAPSS, July 2015, 341-358., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV15N3.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-15-no-3-%E2%80%93-september-2015,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 15, No. 3 – September 2015",Regular Issue,2015
"Like citizens of other countries, residents of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark, and Finland suggest, in response to simple survey questions, that they would like judges to be more punitive.  But also like residents of other countries, when given adequate information, they appear to be quite content with the sentences actually imposed on offenders in their countries.",", Politicians in the Scandinavian countries, like politicians in some other countries, are under pressure to do what is necessary to ensure that sentences reflect what the public demands. The problem, as elsewhere, is to determine what the public really wants.  Research conducted in various countries suggests that “With more information and more possibility to understand the situation and people involved, the more nuanced the recommended punishment [from ordinary citizens] becomes” (p. 344)., Studies were carried out in Denmark, Iceland, Sweden and Finland between 2009 and 2012.  Three types of assessments were used.  The general sense of punishment was measured by asking people simple questions about sentencing (e.g., whether  sentences are too lenient, too severe, about right, etc.).  An informed sense of justice was assessed by giving respondents detailed descriptions of cases (about a page in length). Finally, a concrete sense of justice was assessed by showing respondents, in focus groups, a film of a fictitious case in which they saw details of the offence, offender and victim after which they discussed the case for 1-2 hours.  Not all studies were carried out in all countries, however., In the countries in which a general sense of punishment was assessed (Sweden, Denmark, Iceland), the majority of respondents (59% to 77%) – as elsewhere – thought that sentences were too lenient, and most (73% to 78%) thought that sentences in violent crimes, in particular, should be harsher.  In order to assess an informed sense of justice, one-page summaries of cases (domestic violence, assault, rape, armed robbery, embezzlement, and heroin smuggling) were given to people in all four countries.  Judges, given these same cases, tended almost invariably to suggest that a prison term was the sentence that would be imposed.  Ordinary respondents varied somewhat across cases and countries. Swedish respondents appeared to be most likely to recommend imprisonment, but even for them the range was from about 62% to 83% recommending prison (though the consensus among judges was that prison would be the expected sentence).   Those from Finland were least likely to recommend imprisonment (range 30% to 70%).  However, only in Finland did the public sometimes want sentences to be harsher than the sentences judges said would be appropriate. However, this was true for only three of the cases (rape, street violence, domestic violence) and was particularly true when the person being sentenced was described as a first offender. First offenders are rarely imprisoned in Finland., Though not completely consistent across the three countries in which an informed sense of justice was assessed by using focus groups, in general,  after discussing cases in groups,  respondents were less likely to believe that prison was the most appropriate sanction., Conclusion:  When people were given more information about criminal cases – and in addition when they were given an opportunity to discuss and hear other perspectives on criminal cases – they generally appear to be considerably less likely to desire harsher sentences than when they are asked general questions about sentences.  These results are similar to those from actual jurors who, generally, do not desire harsher sentences than the sentences handed down by judges in ‘their’ cases (Criminological Highlights 11(6)#2, 15(2)#4, 14(1)#6).  Even though respondents tended to say that they wanted harsher sentences (when asked simple general questions), the results suggest the view that the public demands harsher sanctions is wrong.  Said differently “it would be difficult to justify increases in the harshness of criminal sanctions by referring to the presence of a public demand for such a shift” (p. 359)., Reference: Balvig, Flemming, Helgi Gunnlaugsson,  Kristina Jerr, Henrik Tham, and Aarne Kinnunen (2015).

The likelihood of someone convicted of a sex offence reoffending decreases substantially the longer that person remains in the community offence-free.,"Sexual offenders are often believed to be the least likely offenders to change, even though the evidence suggests that their rate of recidivism overall does not distinguish them from other groups of offenders (See Criminological Highlights 3(3)#3, 5(1)#4, 6(3)#3, 6(6)#8, 9(2)#5, 13(2)#6 ).  The result of this incorrect belief is that various jurisdictions put special controls on those released from prison after serving sentences for sex offences., However, sex offenders as a group vary considerably in their likelihood of committing another sex offence.  If sex offenders are like more general offenders, the greatest risk for new criminal offending occurs immediately after release from prison.   The purpose of this study is to see whether the time that a sex offender has been free in the community relates to recidivism risk., Using an aggregate sample of 7,740 sex offenders from 21 different samples, this study estimates the overall sex offence recidivism rates (charges or convictions) for those 5 and 10 years after release, for both typical offenders and low- and high-risk offenders (categorized by the most widely used sexual offender risk tool that is used in mental health and corrections, the Static-99R)., The overall sexual offence recidivism rate was highest in the first few years after release from prison.  For the sample as a whole, 10.1% committed new sex offences within 5 years, 14.2% within 10 years, and only 2.4% more or 16.6% within 16 years., For the highest risk group, 22% had reoffended with a sex offence within 5 years.  Within 10 years, only an additional 7% (28.8% overall) had reoffended, and at 15 years, only an additional 3% (31.8% overall) reoffended.  No high risk sex offender who had been offence-free for 16 years reoffended.  For low risk sex offenders 2.2% had reoffended within 5 years, 3.1% within 10 years, and 4.7% within 15 years.  For the large ‘moderate risk’ group (62% of the overall sample),  6.7% reoffended; within 10 years 10.4% reoffended, and within 15 years 12.6% reoffended., Conclusion: “The risk of sexual recidivism was highest in the first few years after release, and decreased the longer [these offenders] remained offence free in the community” (p. 2804-5).  The decline over time was greatest for those who had been categorized as highest in risk. “If high-risk sexual offenders do not reoffend when given the opportunity to do so, then there is clear evidence that they are not as high risk as they are initially perceived [to be]” (p. 2805).  What this implies, of course, is that given that all measures we have (risk prediction measures as well as simple criminal history records) are fallible indicators of risk-relevant propensities to re-offend, individuals who score high either may never actually have been high risk or they may genuinely have changed.  The data do show that, as a group, those classified as high risk are, indeed, more likely to reoffend than those with lower classifications.  Hence it would make sense, initially, to focus resources (service and monitoring) on them initially.  However, the results also suggest that “sexual offenders who remain offence-free could eventually cross a ‘redemption’ threshold in terms of recidivism risk, such that their current risk for sexual crime becomes indistinguishable from the risk presented by non-sexual offenders” (p. 2806)., Reference: Hanson, R.

"Recidivism rates of those who served their sentences in a private prison in Minnesota were, if anything, higher than recidivism rates of those who served their sentences in state-operated facilities.",", Though the number of prisoners in privately operated prisons in the United States is not large (estimated at 8% of all US prisoners), interest in the “effectiveness” of private prisons has been high., Various concerns have been raised about the privatization of punishment (see Criminological Highlights 3(6)#1, 3(6)#2), as well as the fact that private prisons do not seem to be less expensive for the state when all costs are considered (Criminological Highlights, 2(5)#2). Furthermore, the evidence seems to show that they may foster more prison disturbances (Criminological Highlights 5(2)#1) and do not appear to reduce recidivism rates (Criminological Highlights 7(3)#3, 8(1)#1). Generally speaking, it has been found that cost savings are non-existent or negligible, and there is little evidence that recidivism rates are lower among prisoners who served all or part of their sentences in private facilities., This paper examines the recidivism rate of 1,766 prisoners who spent time in a Corrections Corporation of America prison in Minnesota, comparing their post-release behaviour to 1,766 comparable prisoners who did not spent time in the private facility.  All were released between 2007 and 2009.  As is generally the case elsewhere, only a subset of Minnesota prisoners were eligible to serve their sentences in private facilities. Hence, in this study, propensity score matching, based on 20 relevant variables, was used to create pairs of prisoners who had similar characteristics, but where one prisoner spent time in the private prison whereas the other did not. Prisoners who served their time in the private facility spent, on average, a year there., The follow-up period, after release from prison during which reoffending was measured, averaged about 30 months. Reoffending was assessed using 4 different measures: Rearrest, reconviction, reincarceration, and revocation of parole.  For each of these outcomes, three different analyses were carried out: the impact of any time in private prison, the number of days spent in private prison, and the proportion of the sentence spent in the private facility.  In addition, analyses were carried out using only those who served at least a year in the private facility as well on those who spent at least 50% of their prison time in the private facility., In all, then, 20 different analyses were carried out, each of which was in the direction of higher recidivism rates in private facility. In 8 of these 20 analyses, the recidivism rates were significantly higher for those who spent time in the private prison.  Reconviction rates were higher for all 5 operationalizations of ‘time in private prison.’, The study did not, unfortunately, provide any clear data on why recidivism rates – most notably reconviction rates – might have been higher for those who were incarcerated in the private prison.  There were programming differences between the two facilities (more of a variety of programs in the state-operated prison) and it was more difficult for people in the community to visit prisoners in the private facility., Conclusion: The daily per-prisoner costs to the state of the private and state-run institutions were very similar.  However, given the higher reconviction rates for those who spent time in the private prison, it would appear there were higher costs, ultimately, to the state if the prisoner went to a private prison. Hence, “the evidence from this evaluation and prior studies indicates that private prisons are not a superior alternative to state-run prisons” (p. 391).  More cautiously, the results suggest that one cannot assume superiority of privately run prisons., Reference: Duwe, Grant and Valerie Clark (2013).  The Effects of Private Prison Confinement on Offender Recidivism: Evidence from Minnesota.  Criminal Justice Review, 38(3), 375-394., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV15N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-15-no-4-%E2%80%93-december-2015,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 15, No. 4 – December 2015",Regular Issue,2015
"Treatment by the police that is perceived to be unfair reduces citizens’ willingness to be law abiding because being treated badly leads people to feel angry or resentful which, in turn, makes them less likely to follow the law and obey the police.",", There is considerable evidence that procedurally fair treatment by the police is important in motivating ordinary citizens to cooperate with them and to follow the law (Criminological Highlights 4(4)#1, 7(1)#4, 11(4)#1, 12(5)2, 15(1)#5, 15(3)#2).  This paper, reporting the results of a survey and an experiment, examines the psychological mechanism whereby unfair treatment appears to reduce the view that obeying the law and the police is important., In this study, a representative sample of Australians (drawn from voting lists) was asked to fill out a survey questionnaire in 2007, and again in 2009.  The study focuses on those who had contact with the police in the previous 12 months.  Procedural justice was measured by such questions as whether the police were polite, respectful, and fair.  Those who reported that they were treated fairly, etc., by the police were less likely to report being angry, resentful, frustrated, etc., after the interaction with the police (controlling for age, gender, level of education, and income).  Those who reported having been treated in a procedurally fair manner were also more likely to report willingness to comply with the law and to obey the police.  However, when the reported emotional response of the respondent to the encounter was controlled for, the effect of procedural justice disappeared.  This pattern of findings suggests that the relationship between being treated in a procedurally just fashion and compliance with the law and the police is mediated by negative affect created by procedurally unjust treatment.  Said differently, being treated in a procedurally unjust fashion leads to feelings of frustration and anger which, in turn, reduce the likelihood of future compliance with the police and with the law., In the second (experimental) study, Australian university students were given descriptions of one of two scenarios in which they were to imagine being stopped by the police for exceeding the speed limit by 5 km/hour. In one scenario (given to half the respondents) the police officer was described as courteous, friendly, and giving an explanation for the stop.  For the other half of the respondents, the police officer was described as rude, condescending, and not explaining the purpose of the stop.  Once again, being treated in a procedurally unjust fashion led respondents to report more negative affect. In addition, they reported they would, in the future, be less likely to be careful to follow all road rules, and generally would be less likely to follow the law.  However, once again, when negative affect was controlled for, the effect of procedural justice disappeared suggesting that being treated in a procedurally unfair manner leads people to be angry, etc., which in turn makes them less likely to follow the law in the future., Conclusion: “Procedural justice appears to be consistently important for influencing both emotional reactions and compliance [with the law and the police]….  By engaging with the public in a polite, respectful, and empathetic manner, police officers will be able to reduce negative sentiments and emotion directed at them, thereby increasing people’s willingness to comply with them both immediately and in the future” (p. 269).  “If the police wish to be able to effectively manage citizen behaviour and promote compliance with the law, the findings… suggest that they ought to treat people with procedural justice” (p. 270)., Reference: Barkworth, Julie M, and Kristina Murphy (2015).

"Restorative Justice conferences involving victims and offenders carried out, largely, on those who had been found guilty, led to small reductions in subsequent offending.",", Many claims are made about the effectiveness of restorative justice practices in the criminal justice system.  Few have been substantiated with adequate data.  In an attempt to evaluate whether restorative justice conferences reduce repeat offending, this study carefully examined 519 studies that purported to have relevant findings.  Unfortunately, only 10 of these studies were adequately carried out to the extent that inferences about their effectiveness in reducing re-offending could be made., “The diverse nature of [restorative justice] practices makes it difficult to answer the question of whether ‘restorative justice’ defined so broadly works better than conventional justice …  Most of the practices described as restorative justice have never been subjected to controlled field tests” (p. 2).  Restorative justice conferences (RJC) have, however, been evaluated.  In this paper, studies were examined in which the offence involved an actual victim (in contrast to offences such as impaired driving) and in which cases were assigned on a random (or quasi-random) basis to be resolved with an RJC or by conventional criminal justice approaches.  The ten studies were carried out in the US (1 study), the UK (7 studies) and Australia (2 studies).   Assessment of the effectiveness of the RJC treatment was assessed on the basis of the treatment to which people were randomly assigned.  Some of those assigned to the RJC treatment, in the end, did not receive it.  To avoid selection effects, the effect of the assigned (not received) treatment was examined. Between 68% and 92% of those assigned to RJC received this treatment.  Four studies involved diversion from prosecution or caution. In 4 studies, the RJC took place post-plea, presentence. Two involved RJC after sentence (while the offender was in prison or on probation).  6 studies involved adult offenders; 4 involved young offenders., There was an average repeat offending rate decrease (across all studies) of 0.15 standard deviations in the two years following the assignment.  Hypothetically, if in a given study people without the RJC were likely to commit 2 offences on average and most (95%) committed between 0 and 4 offenses, this would mean that on average the RJC participants would have on average 1.85 repeat offences. There was some suggestion that RJC showed a slightly larger effect when the crime involved was violent, and involved adults rather than youths.  These differences were not, however, statistically significant., Conclusion: “Restorative justice conferences… appear [to] be likely to reduce the future frequency of detected and prosecutable crimes among the kinds of offenders who are willing to consent to Restorative Justice Conferences when victims are also willing to give consent to the process….  The operational basis of holding such conferences at all depends on consent…” (p. 19). However, “the effects of RJCs on the frequency of repeat offending are especially clear as a supplement to conventional justice, with less certainty about its effects when used as a substitute.  Yet RJCs may be seen as most appealing when they can both reduce crime and save money – starting with diversion from expensive court process. The use of restorative processes in this way has grown rapidly in some countries without rigorous testing” (p. 20)., Reference: Sherman, Lawrence W., Heather Strang, Evan Mayo-Wilson, Daniel J.

"Four Australian states show relatively similar patterns of increases in imprisonment rates since the 1970s, yet the local cultures of these 4 states result in different overall rates of imprisonment.",", As in the US (see Criminological Highlights 15(4)#6), the Australian states vary substantially in their imprisonment rates. Although the 2014 national average was 186 per thousand adults, Western Australia’s rate was 265 and Victoria’s was 134.  As in the US during the period 1970-2010, rates of imprisonment increased in each state (though not exactly at the same time). This paper examines the state-specific drivers of penal policy, and its result – imprisonment rates – in four Australian states., In New South Wales (NSW) between 1976 and 1986, policies were implemented to reduce imprisonment. Beginning in 1986, however, ‘law and order’ politics prevailed and sentences were explicitly lengthened (e.g., by abolishing remission). But in addition, pretrial release was made more difficult as a result of 23 legislative changes between 1992 and 2008 and  of changes made a few years later in response to 3 highly publicized crimes.  Judges, it seems, attempted to “resist what they see as legislative and executive incursions into judicial discretion, whether [these changes were] intended to reduce or increase sentences” (p. 353)., Victoria’s increase in imprisonment occurred under left- and right-leaning governments which imposed changes designed to increase imprisonment . Increases occurred a bit later than in NSW.  In the 2010 election, crime became an issue, notwithstanding evidence that Victorians were more accepting of alternatives to imprisonment than their politicians appeared to believe. Politicians promoted the belief that imprisonment was effective in controlling crime.  Overall, Victoria’s policies appear to be driven more by symbolic and emotional pressures “mostly triggered by high-profile media events” (p. 356)., Imprisonment rates in South Australia (SA) started increasing in 1984 and almost tripled since then as a result of actions of both main political parties. Remission was abolished in 1994, a policy supported apparently by both main parties. Various types of offenders were targeted (e.g., sex offenders, certain drug offenders, and those violating conditions of their parole).  SA has a remand rate that is about 50% higher than that of the rest of Australia.  Both major parties currently favour ‘tough on crime’ policies., Western Australia (WA) has historically had high rates of imprisonment. In 1981, a committee established to examine this phenomenon concluded that this was due largely to the number of people imprisoned rather than the length of their prison terms.  WA also has Australia’s highest rate of Indigenous over-representation. The 1990s brought minimum sentence legislation and the abolition of remission. In 2009 an explicit attempt was made to reduce the use of parole., The imprisonment rate for Indigenous people in Australia is 13 times that of non-Indigenous people. For Indigenous women and children it is 24 times the non-indigenous rate.  Though Indigenous incarceration does not explain the differences across states, “it is still arguably the key penal problem in the Australian context” (p. 364).  One explanation is that laws that are, on their face, neutral with respect to race have different effects on Indigenous people.  A complementary explanation is that Indigenous people, because of Australia’s colonial history, have experienced forms of deprivation that are criminogenic and are, as a result, more likely to be involved in crime (especially crimes  likely to result in incarceration)., Conclusion: All states broadly show increased imprisonment rates between 1970 and 2014, though the timing of the increasing rates varies. Differences in imprisonment rates across states are stable across time. In all 4 states that were studied in detail, crime became more politicized and no party in any state was consistently willing to distance itself from high imprisonment policies. The views of judges are important in understanding the effects of legislative changes on the sentences imposed.  But in addition, local traditions, cultures, and values are important in understanding differences in imprisonment trends., Reference: Tubex, Hilde, David Brown, Arie Freiberg, Karen Gelb, and Rick Sarre (2015).  Penal diversity within Australia.

"Between 1970 and 2010, the 50 US states were united in one important way: all 50 states (and the federal government) increased their imprisonment rates by at least 100%.  But the amount that state imprisonment rates increased is a reflection of value differences across the various states.",", In the early 1970s, before imprisonment rates in the US started increasing, state imprisonment rates (excluding jails and federal prisons) across the US states varied from a low of 25 prisoners per 100,000 residents in North Dakota to a rate of 183 in North Carolina.   By 2010, the range was from a low of 150 in Maine to 862 in Louisiana.  This paper suggests that the increases were linked to, and may reflect, other social policies of exclusion., In the current debate about how to bring American imprisonment rates down to those in other western countries, the focus seldom is on the 51 independent jurisdictions that may need to change in order to accomplish this goal.  Other countries that have reduced their imprisonment rates dramatically (e.g., Finland – See Criminological Highlights 3(5)#1, 13(4)#8) have found that many legislative changes over a long period of time were needed, although in some cases (Alberta, Canada, for example: Criminological Highlights 14(3)#6) reduced imprisonment rates occurred quickly as a result of local administrative changes.  For the US, then, 51 separate initiatives would be necessary to bring down imprisonment in each jurisdiction., In important ways, then, there is no US imprisonment rate.  The build-up of imprisonment in the US is interesting in part because, like Australia (see Criminological Highlights 15(4)#5) increases happened in each state but the size of the increase was not uniform.  Maine and Minnesota increased their imprisonment rates by ‘only’ 100 and 144 (prisoners per 100,000 residents), respectively.  At the other end of the spectrum Mississippi and Louisiana increased their rates by 616 and 749, respectively.  Variability, is then, the rule, and more interestingly, the states that increased their imprisonment rates most between the early 1970s and 2006-2010, also started with relatively high imprisonment rates.  In other words, the most punitive states in the early 1970s tended to increase their punitiveness the most, suggesting that punitive sentencing policies are linked to other more fundamental values., Not surprisingly, then, those states in which capital punishment was permitted (in 2012) were more likely to have high imprisonment rates in 1970-74 and in 2006-10, and to have the largest increases in imprisonment compared to abolitionist states. The states that disenfranchise those convicted of felonies (see Criminological Highlights 5(5)#1) also had larger increases in imprisonment and higher imprisonment rates in 2006-10 than those that did not remove this right of citizenship from those who have served their sentences for a felony.  Similarly, those states that have low minimum wages (below the federal rate) or that ban certain forms of welfare assistance for ex-felon drug offenders increased their imprisonment rate more and ended up with higher rates than those states with more generous minimum wages or states that did not remove the right to welfare from ex-felon drug offenders.  Said differently, harsh sentencing policies are associated with harsh policies in other social domains., Conclusion: “That imprisonment rates are linked to … other social policies suggests that high imprisonment cannot be addressed in a vacuum that ignores social and cultural factors or values. Intuitively, it seems reasonable to expect that states that practice capital punishment, do not allow ex-felons to vote or receive certain welfare benefits after the expiry of their sentences, and have a low minimum wage… would likely need different types of political pressures to reduce their (high) imprisonment rates than are states on the other end of each of these dimensions. Hence changing imprisonment policy in the US may present a greater challenge than in many non-federal states” (p. 556)., Reference: Doob, Anthony N. and Webster, Cheryl Marie (2014) Creating the Will to Change: The Challenges of Decarceration in the US.

Interventions designed to provide reintegration services for those serving short prison sentences can reduce both violations of conditions of release as well as reoffending.,", Although rehabilitation programs in prison have received a good deal of attention for decades, a focus on the reintegration of prisoners released from prison is fairly new (see Criminological Highlights 6(1)#1).   This paper reports the evaluation of a Minnesota program aimed at providing basic support to prisoners released from prison who had previously violated conditions of supervised release.  The prisoners who were the focus of the program, then, were those deemed to be high risk to fail., The study randomly assigned prisoners released after serving no more than 6 months in prison to one of two conditions.  They either received ‘treatment as usual’ (involving setting the conditions of release and giving help in finding appropriate housing) or they received a more concentrated ‘Second Chance’ treatment program involving access to a one-stop community ‘hub’ where a wide range of different services (e.g., housing and employment) were available in one location.  But in addition, those who received the ‘Second Chance’ treatment also were eligible for up to 75 days of transitional housing (sometimes receiving cash assistance for housing), up to 16 weeks of subsidized employment as well as referrals to non-subsidized employment programs and training programs for a year.  The ‘second chance’ group also had access to weekly ‘life skills” programming and were given bus passes (for a year).  For the treatment group, contact with the community service providers began before release so that when release occurred, all of the necessary help was in place and prisoners knew how to access services.  For this reason, in order to be eligible for the program, prisoners needed to have at least five months left in their sentence before being assigned to receive the program.  Although there were some problems in the assignment of prisoners (e.g., some were assigned to the treatment program but were later found not to meet the criteria), the control and treatment groups appeared to be comparable on most variables., The ‘second chance’ group clearly received more services than the control group in terms of community based cognitive-behavioural programming, employment assistance, and transportation assistance and participation in hub-based ‘one-stop’ services.  On housing the services received seemed comparable in quantity of assistance, though the exact nature of the help probably differed., The two groups were followed for at least one year.  The ‘second chance’ prisoners were less likely than the control group to have their release revoked because of a violation of condition of release.  More importantly, perhaps, ‘second chance’ prisoners were less likely (23%) to be reconvicted for a new felony offence than those in the control group (31%).  Other analyses suggested that “employment assistance, including subsidized employment, was one of the most influential factors in reducing recidivism risk” (p. 210)., Conclusion:  This prisoner re-entry program was designed for a particular group of prisoners who were known to be at risk for violating conditions of release.  Its success, therefore, should not be interpreted as meaning that any ‘re-entry program’ will work equally well. In this study, it was demonstrated that “Dedicating some extra planning and resources toward… high risk short-term offenders [who have previously violated conditions of release] can significantly reduce recidivism” (p. 211).  “In line with established principles of effective correctional treatment…. the targeting of high-risk prisoners for intensive programming, the use of highly trained staff in a structured program” (p. 212) may account for the apparent success of the program., Reference: Clark, Valerie A.

"Contact with the police can increase the likelihood of future violent offending for those already involved in small amounts of violent crime, but not for those who, previously, were not involved in violent crime.",", There is substantial evidence that for young people,  contact with the youth court is more likely to increase future offending than to reduce it (see Criminological Highlights 14(6)#1).  This paper examines the effect of contact with the police on subsequent offending, taking advantage of the fact that many youths who commit offences do not get apprehended for these offences., In this study, boys in Rochester, NY, were interviewed every six months starting when they were approximately age 13 until they were about age 17.  The focus of the study was on self-reported violent crime.  Since most violent crime (e.g., fights between youths) does not come to the attention of the police, this was probably the best measure of involvement in violence for these youths.  The measure used was the number of different kinds of violence (attacking someone with a weapon, throwing things at someone, robbery, etc.) the youth engaged in.  Because the youths were interviewed regularly during this period of time, it was possible to classify different youths into different groups in terms of their involvement in crime.  In this case, youths appeared to fall into three relatively distinct groups: those who reported close to no violence in early adolescence (39% of the sample), those involved in relatively little violence (49% of the sample) and those involved in a substantial amount of violence (11% of the sample).  Not surprisingly, these three groups varied dramatically in how much police contact they had experienced before age 16., Within each of the three groups, youths were identified who had and had not been picked up and formally questioned by the police for suspected involvement in crime between age 16 and age 17-18.  Youths who had been in contact with the police were then matched with those who had not had police contact on a wide range of measures (using their predicted likelihood of having police contact based on their previous reported behaviour and other measures such as race , neighbourhood characteristics, family structure, peer associations, prior justice system contact, etc.). For the high offending group, separate from the other groups, however, acceptable matching was not possible.  Hence it is not possible to look at the impact of police contact on this group.  However, since this group would likely have had contact with the police earlier in their lives, it is likely that an additional police contact would not have much additional impact on them., It appeared that contact with the police had very little, if any, impact on the non-offending group.  For the low-offending group, however, there was an effect: police contact appeared to increase subsequent involvement in violence in the 1.5 years following the contact. “When individuals are successfully matched on 40 [variables], there is empirical evidence for a short-run labeling effect of the police contact treatment for the low offending… group” (p. 458-9)., Conclusion:  The fact that police contact with youths who have, thus far in their lives, engaged in some, but not very much violence, has the effect of increasing subsequent violence suggests that “the police are [faced with] a most difficult task. [In responding to possible offending by these youths] police intervention may unintentionally make the offending problem worse in the short run” (p. 459).  The effect of police contact was not found for the (previously) non-offending group, in part perhaps, because they show stronger attachment to parents and school and have fewer delinquent friends., Reference: Ward, Jeffrey T., Marvin D. Krohn, and Chris L. Gibson (2014).  The Effects of Police Contact on Trajectories of Violence: A Group-Based, Propensity Score Matching Analysis.  Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 29(3), 440-475., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV15N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-15-no-4-%E2%80%93-december-2015,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 15, No. 4 – December 2015",Regular Issue,2015
"Being arrested by the police increases the likelihood that a youth will commit further offences and, quite independently, also increases the likelihood that the youth will be arrested again.","There is a substantial literature demonstrating that criminal justice processing does not generally decrease offending and, in fact, may increase it (see Criminological Highlights 11(4)#3).  This paper seeks to understand the mechanism whereby the arrest of young people might increase their subsequent involvement in the justice system., There are two straightforward mechanisms whereby the arrest of a youth might increase the youth’s subsequent involvement in the justice system. First, arrest could stigmatize the youth which in turn could increase the youth’s likelihood of offending. Second, arrest could make the youth more of a target for law enforcement in the future, regardless of the youth’s rate of offending., The study was carried out using data from a longitudinal study in Chicago, in which 12- and 15-year-olds were interviewed 3 times, with 2.5 year intervals between the 3 waves of interviews. Some of the youths were arrested between the 1st and 2nd wave.  To determine the effect of arrest on subsequent offending and subsequent arrests, equivalent groups of youths were created on the basis of data collected at Wave 1 – prior to being arrested.  Given that most youths commit offences, but most youths are not arrested, for most youths who were arrested (between Wave 1 and Wave 2) there were others who had the same propensity to be arrested (e.g., similar rates of self-report offending) but who weren’t arrested., Hence two equivalent groups were created: those arrested between the 1st and 2nd interview and those not arrested who were equivalent to the arrested sample (on 79 variables). Without matching, arrested and non-arrested youths are obviously different.  However, for a matched group of 38 arrested youths and 111 non-arrested youths (each arrested youth was matched with up to 3 non-arrested youths), there were no important differences between the groups before the arrest., By the time of the third interview, the self-report violent offending of the arrested group was considerably higher than that of the youths who had not experienced arrest (but were originally equivalent).  The previously arrested group was also considerably more likely to have been arrested by the time of the third interview. However, offending as reported at Wave 3 was not predictive of re-arrest. Said differently, the two effects of the original arrest – increased subsequent offending and increased subsequent arrest by the police – are not related., Conclusion: Being arrested increases subsequent violent offending.  And it increases the likelihood of being rearrested.  Hence it appears that being arrested makes the youth more likely to offend.  But quite independent of offending rates, “a first juvenile arrest seems to increase subsequent law enforcement responses to those youth compared to other youth who offend at a comparable level but have managed to evade a first arrest.  This could result from increased scrutiny of the individual’s future behaviour, by police as well as others… as well as from reduced tolerance by police and actors of an arrestees’ future transgressions” (p. 363)., Reference: Liberman, Akiva M., David S.

Arresting young people when they commit offences reduces the likelihood that they will graduate from high school.,", In Canada in 2013, only about 45% of youths recorded as having been apprehended by the police for a criminal offence were formally charged. The rest, consistent with Part I of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, are dealt with more informally.  Previous research suggests that being apprehended by the police as well as being formally processed by the justice system will, if anything, increase the likelihood of future offending (e.g., Criminological Highlights, 14(4)#5, 11(4)#3)., This paper examines the impact of arresting a youth on the likelihood that the youth will successfully complete high school.  Arrests in the US are common: it is estimated that in a year, 9 out of every 100 US youths age 10-17 are arrested (15 per 100 youths in Chicago are arrested).  Given that most youths commit offences, “compared with incarceration, arrest is more ‘random’ or variable in the juvenile population…” (p. 37)., The study uses data from youths in Chicago collected in three waves starting in 1995-7 (when they were 12-15 years old) and ending in 2000-2.  Data on school dropout were obtained from the Chicago public schools. Arrest records came from the Chicago and Illinois State Police. Only formal arrests were counted; informal “station adjustments” or warnings by police were not considered arrests.  Previous research has demonstrated the simple effect: arrested youths are more likely to drop out of school than nonarrested students, but much of this effect is, almost certainly due to pre-existing individual, family, and neighbourhood differences between those arrested and those not. The challenge is to create two groups of students who, prior to the arrest of one group, were similar. This was done using 82 different variables (individual variables including self-report offending and race, family variables including family structure and home environment, and neighbourhood and school characteristics including concentrated poverty in the neighbourhood and school)., Most of the youths who were arrested were successfully matched on these 82 variables with youths who had not been arrested.  Arrested youths were more likely to drop out of school than those matched youths who were not arrested (73% vs. 51%).  A second analysis was carried out on those who graduated from high school or received equivalent educational certification to see if arrest affected enrolment in a four year post-secondary college program.  34% of the nonarrested group who graduated from high school (or equivalent) enrolled in a college program; only 18% of the arrested group who managed to graduate from high school (or equivalent) enrolled in a 4-year college program., The effect of arrest was not mediated by changes in educational expectations or school attachment of the youth or supportive friends.  It is possible, therefore, that the effect of arrest on high school dropout is mediated, instead, by “institutional responses and the increasingly punitive ‘zero tolerance’ educational climate…” (p. 55)., Conclusion: “Arrest in adolescence hinders the transition to adulthood by undermining pathways to educational attainment.” (p. 54).   Youths who are arrested are more likely to drop out of school than are equivalent youths who are not arrested while in high school.  Given the effects of arrest on high school completion and on enrolment in 4-year post-secondary programs, juvenile arrest can, therefore, be viewed “as a life-course trap in the educational pathways of a considerable number of adolescents in contemporary American cities” (p. 55)., Reference: Kirk, David S. and Robert J.

The vast majority of young sex offenders will never be convicted of another sex offence.,", Although many criminal justice systems have special measures targeting those who have been found guilty of sex offences, it is well established that sex offenders are not especially likely to reoffend (see Some Recent Research on Sex Offenders and Society’s Responses to Them)., This paper examines the criminal justice involvement of young men in England & Wales first convicted of a sex offence before age 21.  After their conviction, they were followed for at least 20 years. Their reoffending history is compared to that of two groups of young men: those convicted of violent offences before age 21 and those convicted of burglary before age 21. The offending histories of young men born in 8 different years (every fifth year beginning in 1953 and ending in 1988) were examined to ensure the results weren’t specific to one historical period., 13.1% of the group first convicted of a sex offence before age 21 were subsequently convicted of another sex offence. Not surprisingly, the sex offence re-conviction rate for the young sex offender group was higher than the rates for the other two groups (2.4%, 2.7%)., Those who were convicted of a sex offence before age 21 were more likely to be convicted subsequently of a violent offence (33%) than a sex offence. They were, however, less likely to be convicted of a violent offence than the young violent or burglary offenders (42%, 37%). The three groups were equally likely to have a reconviction for any offence after age 21 (between 60% and 64% were reconvicted of some offence)., Most of the reconvictions – sexual, violent, or general reoffending – occurred when the offender was in his early 20s.  In fact, the sex offence reoffending rate for the first 10 year period was 10%.  35 years after the initial conviction, the cumulative reoffending rate had only risen to 13.1%.  In fact, 10 years after their initial sex offence conviction, the sex offender group was no more likely to be convicted of a sex offence than were those initially convicted (before age 21) of a non-sex violent offence.  15 years after their initial conviction for a sex offence, these men had the same likelihood of committing a sex offence as those convicted of burglary before age 21., Conclusion: As previous research has shown, the idea that convicted sex offenders have a high likelihood of committing another sex offence is simply wrong. If they reoffend, they are much more likely to commit an offence other than a sex offence.  In this study, 87% of young men convicted of a sex offence before age 21 were not convicted of a sex offence again during the 20 to 35 year follow-up period.   But in addition, if they were to commit another sex offence, it was very likely to be in the first few years after the initial conviction. The usefulness, therefore, of sex offence registry and notification systems – especially those with long (or indefinite) registration periods, needs to be questioned., Reference: Hargreaves, Claire and Brian Francis (2014).  The Long Term Recidivism Risk of Young Sexual Offenders in England and Wales – Enduring Risk or Redemption?

"Contact with the criminal justice system leads people to avoid contact with other organizations – such as banks, medical facilities, formal work places and schools – that keep formal records of contacts with individuals.",", Previous research (see Criminological Highlights 10(5)#4, 14(4)#1, 14(5)#2) has suggested that involvement with the criminal justice system or even simply being stopped by the police can lead to reduced contact with social service agencies as well as lower civic engagement. This paper examines the possibility that contact – even contact not leading to a conviction – with the criminal justice system leads people to avoid ordinary organizations in the community that keep records of contacts., The paper suggests that through ‘system avoidance’ – the practice of avoiding contact with institutions that keep formal records – those involved with the criminal justice system even in minor ways withdraw from involvement with institutions – medical care, schools or work, banks – that keep records.  It is estimated that a quarter of American adults and about 13.6% of Canadians age 12 or older have some form of criminal record.   Hence if having contact with the criminal justice system makes people wary of, for example, seeking medical care when it is necessary or seeking regular employment, criminal justice records can have very negative impacts on society., The data for the study come from two American surveys of young adults (age 18-34). Contact with the criminal justice system was operationalized as being the most intrusive of 5 types of contact that a person might have: no contact, stopped and questioned by the police, arrest, convicted, and incarcerated.  Institutional involvement was divided into two types: contact with surveilling institutions (schools, banks, etc.) and contact with non-surveilling institutions (performing unpaid volunteer or community service work or participation in activities in the past 12 months that were organized by religious groups).  A number of different analytic techniques were used including regression models and “propensity score matching” in which people were matched on their likelihood of having criminal justice contact on the basis of their similarities on 21 sociodemographic and behavioural indicators., The results were very consistent across measures and analytic approaches.  Holding all other factors constant, “Individuals who have been stopped, arrested, convicted, or incarcerated are less likely to interact with institutions that keep formal records, such as hospitals, banks, employment, and schools, than their counterparts without criminal justice contact” (p. 385). There were, however, no such effects of criminal justice contacts on involvement in non-surveilling institutions (volunteer organizations or religious groups).  The fact that this does not hold for non-surveilling institutions suggests that it is not simply withdrawal from institutional contact generally.  The “system avoidance” is focused only on surveilling institutions., Conclusion:  It would appear that contact with the criminal justice system – even when that contact does not involve a finding of guilt – has negative consequences for a person’s willingness to engage with institutions in society. “Given that involvement with the criminal justice system is highly stratified by race and class, the negative consequences of system avoidance will be disproportionately distributed, thus exacerbating pre-existing inequalities for an expanding group of already disadvantaged individuals… Efforts to evade the gaze of different systems involves an attendant trade-off.  That trade-off is full participation in society” (p. 385)., Reference: Brayne, Sarah (2014).  Surveillance and System Avoidance: Criminal Justice Contact and Institutional Attachment.  American Sociological Review, 79(3), 367-391., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV14N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-14-no-6-%E2%80%93-january-2015,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 14, No. 6 – January 2015",Regular Issue,2015
Punishing young people with electronically monitored home detention rather than imprisonment reduces their dependence on welfare benefits after they complete their sentences.,", The electronic monitoring of offenders on house arrest has been touted as saving money and reducing recidivism, though the evidence of its success at accomplishing these goals is, at best mixed (see Criminological Highlights 3(2)#4, 4(3)#7)., At an operation level, those on electronically monitored house arrest have often been those who would not have ordinarily been imprisoned in the first place; hence it often acts not as a substitute for imprisonment but as a supplement to another non-custodial sentence. Hence there are often no cost savings.  In Denmark, however, electronically monitored house arrest is not a sentence by the court. Instead, those actually sentenced to prison can, in certain circumstances, apply to prison authorities to serve their sentence at home while being electronically monitored.  For non-traffic offences, the practice was introduced in April 2006 for offenders under age 25 serving a sentence of 3 months or less.  The age restriction was removed in June 2008. This study examines the impact of electronic monitored house arrest on welfare dependence after the end of the sentence., Because those serving their sentences in the community with electronic monitoring in Denmark are different from ordinary prisoners (e.g., they have to have a permanent address and a job), the challenge, in assessing the impact of the sanction, is to find an appropriate comparison group. This study examines male non-traffic offenders who were sentenced to 3 months or less in prison.  A group of men under age 25 sentenced after April 2006 who were offered electronic monitored house arrest instead of imprisonment were matched (on 26 demographic and criminal justice indicators) with comparable men sentenced to prison prior to this date (when electronic monitored house arrest was not available).  Similarly, a group of men over age 25 sentenced after June 2008 (who were eligible for electronic monitoring) were matched with men sentenced before this date., The dependent measure was the ‘average weekly dependency rate’ – the proportion of weeks in the year following the end of the sentence that the offender received social welfare benefits (an indicator, essentially, of employment status)., Prior to being incarcerated, the dependency rates for the electronically monitored and imprisoned groups were comparable.  Looking first at those under age 26, the men who were sentenced before the reform (and therefore served their prison sentences in prison) were more likely to be unemployed in the year following release than those who were sentenced to prison but served their sentences in their homes while being electronic monitored.  However, there was no such effect for older offenders: those who served their sentences while being electronically monitored at home were equally likely to be unemployed as those who were imprisoned.  For younger offenders – but not older offenders – imprisonment decreases the likelihood that the offender will be self-sufficient after the end of the sentence., Conclusion: It would appear that for offenders under age 25 sentenced to 3 months or less in prison, being able to serve the sentence under house arrest while being electronically monitored is a strategy that interferes less with employment than being imprisoned.  For older offenders, however, there is no such benefit on this measure.  For all offenders who serve their sentence in the community, however, there are lower costs and, presumably, less collateral damage than imprisonment (see the Highlights compendium The Effects of Imprisonment on our website)., Reference: Andersen, Lars H. and Signe H.

People’s judgement of forensic evidence – in this study whether a note ostensibly written by a robber was written by the accused – can easily be biased by other quite independent evidence implicating the accused.,", It is often difficult to judge whether an accused person is, in fact, the offender.  But when the prosecution presents what might appear to be independent pieces of evidence implicating the accused, an inference of guilt becomes, of course, more reasonable.  This study suggests that knowledge of one piece of evidence can affect judgements concerning completely independent evidence. In other words, the weight given to ‘independent’ pieces of evidence is not determined independently., “Confirmation biases – that is the tendency to seek out, interpret, and create new evidence in ways that validate one’s pre-existing beliefs – are a pervasive psychological phenomenon” (p. 256).  Furthermore, there is a “growing body of evidence indicating that even expert judgments of forensic science evidence are subjective and susceptible to bias” (p. 256). The studies reported in this paper examine the possibility that ordinary people – jurors, for example, as well as others making forensic judgments – might be influenced in their judgements of handwriting evidence by the knowledge that the accused had made a confession (that was subsequently retracted)., Lay people’s judgements of the similarity of two handwriting samples turn out to be highly varied and generally inaccurate.  Nevertheless, people appear to be quite comfortable making judgements on whether two samples of handwriting were written by the same person., In the first study, a sample of ordinary people (recruited online for an experiment) were asked to imagine that they were jurors. They were given two handwriting samples: one was described as a note that a perpetrator in a robbery had handed a bank teller; the other was described as a handwritten ‘waiver of rights’ written by the accused person at the police station.  The case was modeled after an actual case in which the accused gave a confession that he subsequently stated had been coerced by the police. Half of the study participants were told that the suspect had confessed (and subsequently said that the confession was not true).  The other half were told that he had been questioned at length by the police but had not confessed.  27% of those who heard that the suspect had confessed reported that the two handwriting samples were written by the same person. Where the study respondents heard that there was no confession, only 11% thought that the two samples matched. Furthermore, the perception that the handwriting samples matched was highly correlated with judgements that the accused was guilty., A second study was similar to the first except it was run in two sessions, separated by 5-9 days.  In the first session, the study participants simply rated the similarity of 8 pairs of handwriting samples. In the second session, they read the same case summary as in the first study. Half were told that the accused had confessed (but subsequently withdrew his confession); the other half were told that he had not confessed.  They then were given one of the pairs of handwriting samples that they had rated previously. In the confession present condition, respondents were more likely to judge the samples as coming from the same person than they did previously (36% after hearing about the confession vs. 14% before hearing about it). There was no change in the beliefs that the same person had written the notes in the confession-absent condition., Conclusion: It appears that “judgements of forensic science evidence can be shaped by the knowledge and expectation of the observer” (p. 265).  In other words, judgements about forensic evidence “may be tainted… [by observers’] a priori belief in the defendant’s guilt or innocence, which will have been shaped by their knowledge of other aspects of the case (e.g., a prior confession)” (p. 265).  This phenomenon, sometimes referred to as “corroboration inflation” gives the illusion that the evidence is stronger than it actually is. Weak – or excluded – evidence, in other words, makes other evidence appear to be more trustworthy., Reference: Kukucka, Jeff and Saul M. Kassin (2014).

Parole for those serving determinate sentences in Canada has virtually disappeared.,", Most offenders in Canada serving determinate sentences of 6 months or more are eligible for release on parole after serving 1/3 of their sentences.  They are almost certain to be released automatically after serving 2/3 of their sentences.  During that middle third, parole boards have the power to release them., This study demonstrates that in Canada, discretionary parole for adults serving fixed length sentences occurs rarely and when it does occur, it happens relatively late in the sentence.  The net effect is that the existence of full parole has little effect on the number of adults in Canadian prisons. The Canadian parole system was created in part to reflect a very simple fact: almost all Canadian prisoners will, within a few years of being sentenced, be released back into the community.  Parole was based on the assumption that an administrative board could determine when best to release a prisoner to maximize successful reintegration into society., The challenge of a discretionary parole system is easy to understand:  the prediction of whether or not a prisoner will reoffend if released on parole is necessarily imperfect.  In fact, “The parole board will be seen as responsible for any serious offence by someone granted parole regardless of some calculation of risk…  As the Government [of Canada] noted in… 1990… ‘It is often said that everyone notices the failures of the release system, and no one notices its many successes’” (p. 321)., Calculating the ‘net effect’ of the parole system on imprisonment is not straightforward.  Many prisoners do not apply for parole (knowing, probably, their low likelihood of success). Hence the ‘success rate’ at parole hearings is not, by itself, very meaningful.  In addition, people may be granted parole at various points in the middle third of their sentences.  The effect of being granted parole early (e.g., after serving 34% of the sentence) is considerable.  Being granted parole after serving 65% of a sentence has almost no impact on imprisonment since the prisoner would virtually automatically be released at the 2/3 point in the sentence., This paper, therefore, estimated the actual effect of parole as it currently operates for federal prisoners (those serving determinate sentences of 2 years or more) as well as for provincial prisoners (those serving sentences of less than 2 years).  The “effect” that was measured is easy to understand: how many additional prisoners would there be if parole was abolished and, instead, all prisoners were released at the 2/3 point in their sentences?, In April 2013, there were 14,745 incarcerated federal offenders. If full parole had been abolished, there would be 664 more prisoners (or an additional 4.5%).  In 2011-12, there were 24,822 provincial prisoners.  Abolishing parole for provincial prisoners would increase their number by 395 people (or 1.6%).  Overall, then, abolishing full parole would increase the Canadian imprisonment rate from 113.1 adult prisoners per 100,000 total residents to 116.1 or an overall increase of 2.7%.   Abolishing ‘day parole’ (whereby federal prisoners are released into a community correctional centre) would add an additional 966 prisoners to federal institutions.  The change that would have a very large effect, of course, would be a decision to end the virtually automatic release of prisoners at the 2/3 point in their sentences: that would create an increase in federal imprisonment of 2727 prisoners or an increase of 18.5% in the federal prison population., Conclusion: It would appear that many people – even those close to the criminal justice system – assume that parole is likely to be granted early in a sentence.  Given that this is not true, and Canada’s parole system has little effect on the country’s overall incarceration rate, it would appear that there may be a serious misperception about what a sentence of imprisonment means in Canada., Reference: Doob, Anthony N., Cheryl Marie Webster, and Allan Manson (2014).

Even short periods of time in prison increase dramatically the likelihood that young couples will divorce.,", There is substantial research demonstrating that there are collateral effects of incarceration on those incarcerated and their families (see the Criminological Highlights collection on The Effects of Imprisonment: Specific Deterrence and Collateral Effects ). This paper examines a finding that is especially important for those who believe children should grow up in stable families.  Incarceration that occurs during a marriage appears to be an important cause of divorce., This study examines the impact of incarceration on couples who are young and only recently married.  From the (U.S.) National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, 1847 respondents were identified who were married when they were interviewed at age 18-28. They were interviewed again 6 years later. 62 had been incarcerated between these two interviews.  33 had been incarcerated prior to the first of these interviews (but were still married at the second interview).  The incarceration periods were typically short (mean=3.9 months): 63% were imprisoned for less than a month. Only 9% served a year or more in prison., The challenge addressed by the study was to determine whether the divorce contributed to marriage dissolution or if those who are likely to find themselves in prison are also likely to have divorced even if they hadn’t been incarcerated.  For this reason data on 22 variables, derived from data from the first of these two interviews, were included as control variables to ensure that prior to the incarceration, the groups were similar. The variables included relationship characteristics (e.g., relationship violence, extramarital sex) demographic characteristics (e.g., sex, race, education, employment, children in the home), personal characteristics (e.g., religiosity, drinking, incarceration before marriage), and relationship history (e.g., years married at first interview)., The marriages of those who experienced incarceration during marriage lasted fewer months than did the marriages of the other respondents.  Even when all the control variables were included in a model of marriage dissolution, incarcerations during marriage were associated with increased risk of the dissolution of the marriage. Incarcerations that took place before a marriage were not predictive of marriage breakup., Detailed analysis of the role of low levels of reported marital love, economic strain, relationship violence, and extramarital sex suggest that these problems are made more acute by incarceration and that these problems then led to the dissolution of the marriage. Exactly why these brief periods of incarceration are associated with these causes of marital strain is not clear. One possibility is that the stigma associated with incarceration plays “a role in shaping marital love, conflict, openness to outside relationships, and ultimately divorce” (p. 391)., Conclusion:  There is little doubt that the incarceration of one partner in a marriage puts the marriage at risk, even if the incarceration period is very short. This is consistent with research showing that “incarceration inhibits prosocial life-course transitions that can lead to cumulative and compounded disadvantages as ex-inmates return home.” Incarceration, then “has unintended consequences by disrupting conventional achievement prospects that have been shown to lower criminal offending (e.g., employment and marriage)” (p. 391)., Reference: Siennick, Sonja E., Eric A.

There is no plausible empirical evidence to support the hypothesis that non-educational police involvement in schools reduces crime in schools.,"Although students are typically safer from crime in schools than elsewhere in their communities and school crime in most locations does not seem to be increasing (see Criminological Highlights 2(2)#1, 4(4)#6), some crime does take place in schools.  Not surprisingly, therefore, police in many countries have partnered with schools to reduce crime, especially violence, in schools.  In the U.S., police presence in schools often increases after high profile school shootings take place.  In addition, various special enforcement programs (e.g., searches) and laws (e.g., special penalties for the possession of weapons at or near schools) have been instituted., However, “there has not been a systematic review of the evaluative evidence specific to the ‘policing schools’ area” (p. 82), though there have been some evaluations of programs in which the police teach a structured curriculum (e.g., on drug abuse resistance).  This study examined the existing research in western countries on school-based, non-educational strategies in which the police have a dominant role.   Thus the programs that were examined involved such things as “school resource officer” programs where officers are, in effect, assigned to particular schools and attempt to develop rapport with students, provide a positive role model for students, or address problems such as youth gangs., A very thorough search of published and unpublished research literature was undertaken electronically and manually for papers that included at least one measure of crime or disorder (e.g., police reports, self-reports, school disciplinary records).  Bibliographies of school research were scanned. Google searches using various search terms were undertaken.  Experts in the area were contacted.  For a study to be included in the analysis that eventually was carried out, it had to have an adequate research design. Most importantly, “simple pre-post designs (comparing a before and an after period), which are quite common in policing studies, were not included…  [Also not included were] studies that compared results for a [single] school [in which an intervention took place] to all statewide or city schools” (p. 84).  These studies do not adequately control for other factors occurring at the time, long term trends, etc.  In the absence of an equivalent control school (or schools) one cannot know whether the change was caused by the intervention.  What is interesting, however, is that many of the simple, but inadequate, pre-post designs showed “large and dramatic decreases in school crime or student misbehaviour” (p. 92). This is not surprising given that police resources are often assigned to a particular school because of an unusual outbreak of violence that subsequently recedes on its own., Perhaps the most remarkable finding of this study is that only 11 studies were located that met the eligibility criteria.  Most of these 11 were quite weak methodologically.  But even among these 11, none of the studies involved a randomized experimental design.  And most, if not all, of the 11 studies that were located for the purposes of this review did not have fully adequate designs that would allow one to draw strong inferences even if there had been positive results.  In any case, none of these 11 studies showed favourable impacts of police presence in the schools., Conclusion: It is surprising, given the amount of police resources being expended in school settings, that we do not know more about whether there has been a positive impact of increased police resources in schools. Furthermore, we know almost nothing about what might provide positive results.  Clearly what is needed is a program of randomized assignment of schools to different ‘treatment’ conditions.  Given that most communities have limited resources to assign to police in schools, and many cities have many schools in their public school systems, random assignment of schools to receive (or not receive) police programs could provide both a fair distribution of resources and an opportunity to determine whether a school-police program was effective., Reference: Petrosino, Anthony, Sarah Guckenburg, and Trevor Fronius (2012). ‘Policing Schools’ Strategies: A Review of the Evaluation Evidence.  Journal of MuliDisciplinary Evaluation, 8 (17), 80-101., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV14N1.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-14-no-1-%E2%80%93-january-2014,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 14, No. 1 – January 2014",Regular Issue,2014
Ordinary university students can be induced to plead guilty to something they did not do. All that is necessary is to make it clear that if they confess they can avoid a severe penalty.,", Imagine this situation.  You are stopped by a security guard outside of a store for theft of a pair of gloves that you are carrying in one of your hands.  You explain that you simply forgot to pay for them, but the guard doesn’t believe you.  You are turned over to the police and they offer you a deal:  admit your guilt and immediately contribute $400 to a charity of your choice, and you will not acquire a formal criminal record. Or you can go to court sometime in the next few months and face the possibility that a judge will not believe that you had no criminal intent and will find you guilty. You will then acquire a criminal record in addition to whatever other penalty might be imposed., This study suggests that pleading guilty to crimes one did not do is completely understandable.  Furthermore, it suggests that ordinary intelligent people (university students) will make false confessions under circumstances analogous to those in which ordinary people confess to crimes they are (falsely) accused of.  The problem for innocent defendants who are faced with a choice of accepting a plea bargain is that the alternative – a much harsher outcome if they are found guilty – is too much of a risk.  Innocent defendants are, therefore, at special risk when faced with plea bargains; the result is that many confess to acts they did not do.  And courts have generally accepted the idea that when the confession is ‘voluntary’ – when it is not induced “by actual or threatened physical harm or by mental coercion overbearing the will of the defendant – the bargain [is] permitted” (p. 13)., Students in an American university signed up for what they thought was a problem solving experiment. They worked first with someone who they thought was another student (but in fact was an employee of the experimenter’s).  Then they were asked to solve various problems on their own.  For half of the participants, the ‘other’ person asked the real study participant for help.  Almost all of the students gave help, in clear violation of the rules that had been laid down.  For the other half of the participants, the other person did not ask for help; and no help was ever offered.  When the experimenter returned, she accused the study participant of cheating, noting that there was a pattern of wrong answers that was very unlikely to have occurred by chance.  Then, in the “harsh sentencing” condition, the study participant was told that he could admit his guilt and lose credit for being in the study, or, if he did not, the study participant would be taken before an academic review board that in the majority of cases found people guilty. They were told that, if found guilty, there would be a rather extensive penalty imposed (including notification to various university offices and a required ethics class the next academic term).  In the “lenient sentence” condition, the choice was between losing credit, going before the academic review board and probably having a penalty that was described as being not so severe., Not surprising most (89%) of the ‘guilty’ students accepted the plea deal.  But 56% of the completely innocent students – who had done nothing wrong – were willing to falsely admit guilt in return for a certain, but reduced, punishment.  It seems that when people are placed in real bargaining situations that affect their future lives and presented with information about the choices, they are highly risk averse.  The innocent students were slightly, but not significantly, more likely to falsely plead guilty to cheating when they faced the alternative of being likely to have the harsher penalty imposed., Conclusion:  The study demonstrates that ‘ordinary’ people (university students) will plead guilty to offences they did not commit to avoid the possibility of harsher outcomes. The findings challenge the notion that “innocent defendants [are] not vulnerable to the powers of bargained justice” (p. 46).  It is quite clear that courts are incorrect in placing “confidence in the ability of individuals to assert their right to trial in the face of grave choices” (p. 48)., Reference: Dervan, Lucien E., and Vanessa A.

"Racial profiling can be counterproductive.  Not only does it reduce public confidence in the justice system, but by profiling Blacks, Whites learn that they aren’t going to get caught.",", Racial profiling reduces both citizens’ assessments of the legitimacy of police actions and citizens’ general support of the police (Criminological Highlights 7(1)#4). In addition, it has been suggested (Harcourt 2007: Against Prediction) that when members of the majority group (Whites) become aware that another group (e.g., Blacks) are the focus of enforcement attention, they (the majority group) learn they can offend without being apprehended.  If this is the case, racial profiling could undermine the deterrent value of law enforcement because a large portion of the population believes that nobody is watching them., In this study, cheating by students was the focus. The prediction was that “when Blacks were profiled for cheating, White participants would feel greater impunity and be more likely to cheat than when either Whites were profiled or no profiling occurred” (p. 449)., Black and White university students participated in a study in which small groups of individuals were given very difficult anagrams to solve.  In addition, there were sometimes two ‘confederates’ of the experimenter embedded in the group.  Students were told that they would be monitored for cheating.  Some of the students observed the experimenter move close to the group and stare directly at the confederates (who were Black for some of the groups and White for other groups).  The experimenter then asked the two confederates “to move up front so I can see you better” (p. 349).  They moved to the front of the room.  In about one-third of the groups, nobody was ‘targeted’ by the experimenter. Students were given 15 minutes to do the task. Cheating was made possible by having the correct answers available to the students, though they were told not to look at the correct answers when solving the anagrams., There were no significant differences in the rate of cheating of Blacks and Whites in the control condition when nobody was profiled.  Similarly, when Whites were profiled (i.e., singled out for special scrutiny by the experimenter) White and Black students cheated at the same (low) rate.  However, when Blacks were profiled, the average rate of cheating (number of anagrams on which they apparently cheated) by the White students was roughly three times the rate in any of the other conditions. 
Black students did not cheat more when White students were ‘profiled’ by the experimenter. One possibility is that Blacks did not identify this as ‘racial’ profiling – they simply saw it as behaviour on the part of the experimenter toward these two ‘participants’ rather than ‘profiling’ of Whites rather than Blacks., Police often justify profiling by calling it ‘targeted policing’ – targeting those who, according to their own arrest statistics, are more likely to be involved in certain kinds of illegal activities (e.g., carrying weapons or drugs).   However, this justification ignores two important issues.  In the first place, if one group (e.g., Blacks) are disproportionately stopped, it is hardly surprising to find that they are also disproportionately arrested – even if their actual rate of illegal behaviour is the same as that of other groups.   The second justification for profiling is deterrence: that the profiled group will be deterred by the very real possibility of being caught.  This latter justification ignores findings such as those in this study: by focusing on one group (e.g., Blacks), another larger group (Whites) may learn that they aren’t likely to be caught and, therefore, can break the law., Conclusion: In this study, the behaviour that was the focus of concern (cheating on a test) increased in its overall rate of occurrence because of the profiling of Black students.   More generally, it would appear that reducing the perceived likelihood of apprehension for a crime by focusing on one group to the virtual exclusion of other, can, in fact, increase overall offending in part because, by definition, there are more people who can cheat or offend with impunity than there are people who are deterred as a result of the profiling., Reference: Hackney, Amy A. and Jack Glaser (2013).

The support in the general public for criminal justice policies that punish offenders is driven by important political factors such as the framing of crime by political leaders as the natural result of permissive policies.,", Although we know that ordinary people are not necessarily as punitive as criminal justice policies would suggest (e.g.,  Criminological Highlights, 14(1)#6), there is little research that explains where support for punitive policies comes from and even less on whether these sentiments change in understandable ways over time., The public’s support for punitive criminal justice policies (e.g., capital punishment, mandatory minimum sentences) – or “punitive sentiment” – appears to be (at least in the US) a national phenomenon. Changes in state incarceration rates take place in a manner that appears to support the idea that there are important national changes occurring.  For example, between the early 1970s and 2010, incarceration rates in all 51 US jurisdictions increased by at least 100%., Measuring punitive sentiment historically is not a straightforward task.  This paper identifies 24 different survey indicators of ‘punitive sentiment’ that were administered nationally in the US a total of 242 times between 1951 and 2006. These include such issues as support for capital punishment, 3-strikes laws, and increasing the authority of, or spending on, the police.  In general, over this 55-year period, these indexes of punitiveness moved in similar ways.  When these measures are combined statistically and an index is created for each year, it turns out that there are large and predictable changes in this index of overall punitive sentiment., The largest upturn in punitive sentiment occurred in the 1970s.  Punitive sentiment remained high until about 1997 when it started to decline.  The challenge, of course, is to determine what was driving punitive sentiment in the US.  One of the measures used in this study was an index of the ‘net punitive tone’ of presidential statements on crime.  Statements about the ‘coddling’ of criminals or ‘permissive’ judges are obviously ‘punitive’ in nature whereas concerns about “an endless, self-defeating cycle of imprisonment” (Lyndon Johnson) were coded as supporting social approaches to crime. Punitive statements about crime by presidents during this 55-year period were associated with increases in the overall punitive sentiment of the public. Increased concern about crime and increases in homicide rates were also associated with increases in punitive sentiment. However, the number of incarcerations (controlling for the amount of crime) did not have a relationship with punitive sentiment.  Lack of public support for government welfare policies was also correlated with changes in punitive sentiment. “This finding suggests that the attack on social liberalism was a successful strategy for increasing public support for punitive crime control policies” (p. 349)., In the US, levels of punitive sentiment among Republicans were steady (and high) throughout this 55 year period.  The increase beginning in the 1970s and the decrease beginning in the late 1990s held for independents and Democrats only.  However, in general, for other sub-groups in the population (defined by age, sex, region, race and education) the overall patterns were similar., Conclusion: It would appear that one can, with empirical support, talk about broad changes in the US population in support for punitive policies. However, “that the increase in support for punitive policies occurred at the same time as the public turned away from [social] solutions to poverty is no coincidence….  The ups and downs of punitive sentiment are driven by important political factors such as the construction of crime by political leaders.  The framing of crime as a problem of a permissive system and increasing perceptions of racial integration increased public demand for punitive policies” (p. 357)., Reference: Ramirez, Mark D.

The effect of experiencing child physical abuse on violence in adolescence is weakest in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods.,", It is reasonably well established that those who suffer physical abuse as children are more likely to be violent as adolescents and young adults. It is less well known, however, whether the effects of abuse are amplified or made weaker by the social circumstances in which a child lives., Previous research has demonstrated that disadvantaged neighbourhoods have higher rates of child abuse and maltreatment. Child abuse may be considered, in these neighbourhoods, to be more typical or commonplace than in less disadvantaged neighbourhoods.  The abuse, then, may be more ‘normalized’ which may lead to less severe impacts on the victim., This study examined data from 343 neighbourhood ‘clusters’ in Chicago, collected in two waves (1994-1997 and 1997-2000).   Residents of each of these neighbourhood clusters were assessed on levels of ‘concentrated disadvantage’ (percent below poverty line, receiving public assistance, unemployed), tolerance for deviance (e.g., wrongfulness of drinking, drug use, fighting among teenagers) and the tolerance for family violence., The measure of ‘child physical abuse’ was the report of the parent of the use, during the previous year, of any of four forms of physical abuse against the youth (e.g., hitting the child with a fist, beating the child).  The nature of the relationship between parent and child, the socioeconomic status of the family, and parental criminality were also measured.  When the children were (on average) 11 and 14 years old, they were asked about their involvement in the previous year in various forms of violence (including robbery) and using or carrying a weapon., Controlling for various characteristics of the children, child abuse increased youths’ subsequent violence at age 14.  However, high levels of disadvantage in the youth’s neighbourhoods reduced the impact of child abuse on subsequent violence. In other words, “the relationship between child abuse and violence became weaker as neighbourhood disadvantage increased” (p. 235).  Indeed, in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods, there was essentially no impact of child abuse on subsequent violence., In addition, children living in neighbourhoods characterized as being tolerant of deviance,  and neighbourhoods that tolerated fighting among family members and friends, tended to exhibit higher levels of violence at age 14.  These effects appeared to be independent of characteristics of the youth and the youth’s family (age, race, parental warmth, parental criminality, self-control, delinquency of the youth’s friends)., Conclusion: Although being abused as a child was associated with higher levels of violent behaviour as an adolescent, this effect was reduced considerably in disadvantaged neighbourhoods.  This may be the result of the fact that “in disadvantaged neighbourhood, where violent behaviours are in general more abundant, violence is more likely to be seen as a somewhat common, legitimate, or necessary way of interacting with others, at least under some circumstances” (p. 239).   Alternatively, in more advantaged neighbourhoods, “for youth who [generally] experience few risk factors, the effect of any one risk factor is more readily expressed and potentially more detrimental” (p. 241)., Reference: Wright, Emily M. and Abigail A.

Citizens with intimate knowledge of criminal cases do not want most offenders to receive sentences as harsh as those required by the United States Sentencing Commission guidelines.,", It is sometimes thought that members of the public want harsh sentences.  After all, public opinion studies suggest that most Americans (as well as Canadians) say that sentences are too lenient.  This study, like one carried out in Australia (see Criminological Highlights 11(6)#2), tested this hypothesis in a straightforward way – by asking citizens who knew the cases as well as the judge knew them what they thought the sentence should be. This, then, is a study of jurors’ views of what ‘their’ offender should receive as a sentence., The US Sentencing Guidelines, like most American guideline systems, provide a narrow range of (presumptive) sentences based largely on a standardized (but complex) measure of the seriousness of the offence for which the offender was found guilty and a mechanical calculation of the seriousness of the offender’s criminal record.  Generally speaking, characteristics of offenders, including their reasons for engaging in the crime, are deemed irrelevant to the determination of the sentence.  However, at the time that the guidelines were developed, no careful analysis was carried out to determine what sentences the community would want.  This study took advantage of the fact that jurors can provide a readily accessible and knowledgeable sounding board for sentences.  The only problem is that they are seldom asked their opinions about sentencing, and typically aren’t present when sentences are imposed., The author of this study notes that “After more than 11 years as a federal district court judge, I have observed that jurors, almost without exception, suggest that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines sentencing ranges are too severe… [When meeting with jurors after guilty verdicts] jurors would [invariably] ask what sentence the defendant they had just found guilty was likely to receive… The jurors would nearly unanimously express surprise at the length of the likely sentence [required by the guidelines]” (p. 186)., This study collected systematic data on jurors’ recommended sentences in 22 criminal trials. 88% of the jurors’ recommendations were lower than the minimum allowable sentence under the guidelines. “On average, the Guidelines-recommended minimum sentence was more than twice the juror-recommended sentence” (p. 189).  For example, in a serious drug trafficking case involving firearms and an accused with an extensive criminal history, the Guidelines required a prison sentence of 15 to 17.5 years.  Jurors suggested a median sentence of 3 years. In another case, a drug trafficker received the mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years; the jurors recommended an average of 4.5 years.  In this case, the defendant was Black, whereas 11 of the 12 jurors were white.  The jurors were generally from very different backgrounds from the defendant., The only exceptions to this pattern were white-collar crimes.  In those cases, jurors’ average recommended sentences were longer than the Guidelines’ sentences., Conclusion: It is clear that jurors in US federal cases believe, generally, that the federal sentencing guidelines are too harsh.  Because jurors are likely to have detailed information about the offence and the offender and are likely to reflect the sentiments of the community at large, they may well be a very useful source of information about the appropriateness of sentences being imposed in the cases that they heard.  When politicians in some countries (such as Canada) suggest that the public ‘demands’ that sentences should be harsher, they might want to think, first, about what people really want., Reference: Gwin, (Judge) James S.

"Each year people who have been found guilty of crimes and sent to prison are exonerated and released.  Some receive compensation for their wrongful conviction and imprisonment. Compensation in excess of $500,000 appears to pay off in terms of reduced levels of offending after release.",", Previous research has suggested that being imprisoned for crimes one has not committed has qualitatively different and much more serious psychological impacts on prisoners than one would expect from the literature on the effects of long-term imprisonment (Criminological Highlights 8(3)#6).  But in addition, like all those released from prison, the wrongfully convicted face serious challenges in getting jobs and, more generally, learning the skills necessary for coping in a society that has changed since they were incarcerated., In the US, the wrongfully convicted spend, on average, around 12.5 years in prison before being released.  The question raised by this study is whether the level of compensation they receive for being wrongfully convicted and imprisoned relates in any way to their ability to stay out of trouble after being released., Compensation in many US states is not automatic. Only about half of US states have statutes to compensate the wrongfully convicted, but even then, many states restrict eligibility to only certain types of cases (e.g., those exonerated with DNA evidence; those who did not confess to the original crime).   Furthermore, in some states, the amount of compensation is limited by statute.  New Hampshire, for example, limits those wrongfully convicted to $20,000 in compensation from the state no matter how long they spent in prison for something they did not do., This study looked at the probability of offending (after release from prison) of 118 people who were wrongfully convicted in four states (Illinois, New York, Texas, and Florida) for which criminal history data was available and the amount of compensation was public.  All four of these states have compensation statutes. In 40.5% of the cases, no compensation was given. In 30.6%, an amount ranging from $100 to $500,000 was given, and in 28.8% of the cases, an amount larger than $500,000 was given., Overall, 38% of the sample had a post-exoneration offence.  Those with high levels of compensation ($500 thousand or more) had a considerably lower rate of post-exoneration offending (18.2%) than those who received less compensation (50% reoffended) or no compensation (40% reoffended).  The other factor that predicted reoffending, not surprisingly, was the number of convictions prior to the wrongful conviction (57% had at least one prior conviction)., Conclusion: “It may be that a certain minimum amount of money… is necessary for an exoneree to get his life on track… It [also] may be that exonerees who receive substantial compensation feel fairly treated by the system and thus offend less often…. The difficulty for exonerees is that they face the same obstacles as ordinary offenders released from prison” (p. 576).  Those found not to have committed the offence for which they are imprisoned may be disadvantaged in prison more than ordinary offenders.  This could easily occur because they are seen as not taking responsibility for their offences.   Given the problems that they face – in part because of the length of time that they were imprisoned, but also because they were imprisoned for offences that they did not do –  their requirements for support in trying to establish themselves are considerable.  But, in addition, reasonable levels of compensation may symbolize for them the fact that the community that is responsible for their wrongful conviction is, in effect, taking responsibility for its errors., Reference: Mandary, Even J., Amy Shlosberg, Valerie West, and Bennett Callaghan (2013).

"High concentrations of immigrants in Los Angeles, California, are associated with lower levels of crime.",", There is a long tradition in the U.S. and in Canada of blaming immigrants for crime.  Nevertheless, the data generally show that immigrants themselves tend to have relatively low levels of offending, despite their tendency (for economic reasons) to settle in disadvantaged neighbourhoods.  Their children, on the other hand, may have higher rates of involvement in crime in part because of the disadvantages they experience and the neighbourhoods in which they live (see Criminological Highlights, 13(6)#6)., Recent research suggests that high concentrations of immigrants in a city are associated with lower rates of crime. It is not clear, however, whether this is an effect simply of the higher concentration in ‘high immigrant’ cities of people who are concerned that being arrested could lead to deportation.  The question, then, is whether increased concentrations of immigrants “will lead to reductions in neighbourhood crime [after controlling for] the effects of structural deficits in poverty concentration, mobility, and age structure” (p. 197)., This study looks at changes in crime in Los Angeles census tracts from 2000 to 2005 as a function of the change in the concentration of foreign born (largely Hispanic/Latino residents) between 1990 and 2000, controlling for various factors (e.g., poverty, the concentration of female headed households).  There was considerable variability across neighbourhoods in the change in the concentration of immigrants in this 10 year period., The approach that is used predicts, from neighbourhood characteristics in 1990, what the concentration of immigrants would be in 2000.  Essentially, then, in order to control for pre-existing differences in neighbourhoods, the study “compares neighbourhoods with similar expected probabilities of receiving immigrant settlement and compares the difference in crime changes between those that actually received this treatment [large concentrations of new immigrants] versus those that don’t” (page 200)., The results show that high immigrant concentrations in 1990 were associated with decreased crime in the first part of the next decade. In addition, “higher predicted concentration of immigrants are associated with greater than expected reductions in total reported criminal offences and violent crime….  Interpreting the estimates at the sample means for total and violent crimes suggests that a 19.1% increase in the concentration of immigrants in Los Angeles neighbourhoods reduces the average amount of total crime in a neighbourhood by 35.7% and violent crime by 40.9%” (p. 205).  These effects hold “even after taking into account that immigrants are likely to [move to] neighbourhoods with [other immigrants]” (p. 209)., Conclusion: Crime can have “negative effects on city economies, causing urban flight and population decline for entire cities or in specific neighbourhoods.”  For Los Angeles, the early 1990s “was a period of increasing migration of predominately Latin American immigrants to neighbourhoods of concentrated poverty that produced net reductions in serious crimes reported to the police”.  In other words, the new immigrants appear to have been responsible for large reductions in crime, especially in areas of the city that “have been historically linked to crime and gang violence among native Latino populations” (p. 210)., Reference: MacDonald, John M., John R. Hipp, and Charlotte Gill (2013).  The Effects of Immigrant Concentration on Changes in Neighbourhood Crime Rates.  Journal of Quantitative Criminology, 29, 191-215., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV14N1.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-14-no-1-%E2%80%93-january-2014,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 14, No. 1 – January 2014",Regular Issue,2014
The Imprisonment of Fathers Causes Child Homelessness.,"A substantial amount of research published in recent years suggests that imprisonment not only has negative effects on those who are imprisoned but also collateral effects on the children of fathers who are imprisoned (e.g., Criminological Highlights 1(1)#6,  9(5)#6, 12(5)#1, 12(6)#7, 13(1)#7, 13(3)#3).  Homelessness is one of the more extreme negative effects that many children face.  This paper looks at the impact of the imprisonment of mothers and fathers on the likelihood of an American child becoming homeless., There is reason to believe that the imprisonment of mothers and fathers could have very different impacts on what happens to a child. “The most obvious way parental incarceration promotes child homelessness is by destabilizing family finances. Not only are [fathers] unable to provide financial support when incarcerated, but incarceration reduces job prospects subsequent to incarceration (Criminological Highlights 11(4)#4).  In addition, in many states, federal policies make it impossible for families with an incarcerated parent to receive cash welfare, food stamps, and subsidized housing.  Incarcerating the mother, on the other hand, creates a different set of problems for their children, but not necessarily homelessness “because state interventions into the lives of the children of incarcerated mothers will push the children into foster care instead” (p. 77)., This study uses data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study focusing on the lives of children who had at least one parent complete interviews when the child was 30 and 60 months old.  Homelessness was defined as living in temporary housing, a group shelter, on the street at the time of the interview or in a place such as a car not intended to house people in the past year. Obviously this underestimates homelessness since it largely looks at homelessness only at the time of the interview., Incarceration of the father when the child was between 30 and 60 months old increased the likelihood of homelessness for the child even after various demographic controls were taken into account.  These included, among many other control factors,  whether a parent had been incarcerated prior to the child being 30 months old, the level of poverty of the family when the child was 30 months old, the number of housing moves that took place in the previous 30 months, and whether the child was homeless at 30 months.  It would appear, however, that “the effects of recent paternal incarceration on child homelessness are concentrated among African American children” (p. 90) and may not extend to children who are not African American. Recent maternal incarceration is not associated with an increase in the risk of child homelessness., Conclusion: “The effects of maternal incarceration on children’s risk of foster care placement have been well documented” (p. 92) and, therefore, it is understandable that the findings of this study suggest that maternal incarceration does not increase homelessness of children. The finding that paternal incarceration does increase the likelihood of homelessness for children – especially African American children – suggests that mass incarceration may indirectly contribute to racial inequality.  This effect would be above and beyond the direct long term effects of incarceration on the offender himself., Reference: Wildeman, Christopher (2014).  Parental Incarceration, Child Homelessness, and the Invisible Consequences of Mass Imprisonment.  Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 651, 74-96., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV14N2.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-14-no-2-%E2%80%93-march-2014,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 14, No. 2 – March 2014",Regular Issue,2014
"“Certainty of apprehension, not the severity of the ensuing legal consequence, is the more effective deterrent.”",", For more than forty years, there have been suggestions that increasing the severity of punishments imposed on apprehended offenders will not reduce crime through the mechanism of general deterrence.  Many reviews (e.g., Criminological Highlights 6(2)#1) of this literature have been written over the years, most of which come to the same conclusion as the quotation from this review (on  p. 199) that forms the title of this summary., “The theory of deterrence is predicated on the idea that if state-imposed sanction costs are sufficiently severe, criminal activity will be discouraged, at least by some,” but there must be “some possibility that the sanction will be incurred if the crime is committed” (p. 206).   Certainty of apprehension, then, is a key component of deterrence. The police have two important roles in achieving deterrence: “apprehending the perpetrators of crime and serving in a sentinel function that deters crime from happening in the first place” (p. 207).  One of the complexities in the research literature on deterrence that needs to be addressed is that often certainty and severity are intertwined.  For example, one study of strategies to get people to pay fines compared ordinary enforcement with the imminent threat of a short period of incarceration.  The latter approach was more effective and may be seen as supporting the conclusion that “certainty rather than the severity of punishment is the more powerful deterrent.”  However, it is also necessary that “certainty must result in a distasteful consequence in order for it to be a deterrent” (p. 228).  For there to be an effect of certainty, the penalty cannot be trivial in comparison to the expected value of committing the offence. However, the nature of the relationship between the severity of a penalty and its effect on crime may be such that most if not all penalties are already at a level that they are having maximum effects. Increasing penalties that are already seen as being very harsh cannot be expected to affect crime rates.  In fact, for much of the population (e.g., middle class people not normally committing crimes) the fact that something is criminalized may be sufficiently severe to have maximal deterrent impact., Achieving deterrence through increasing apprehension risk assumes two things: first that apprehension risk can readily be increased, and second that it is known.  Though it appears to be difficult to increase apprehension risk for many crimes, the strategic deployment of police can deter crime through another mechanism: by creating prohibitively high perceived risk of apprehension.  This is, of course, the theory behind deploying large numbers of police in identified crime ‘hot spots.’  Nevertheless, for various reasons, “overall crime control policy [involving the police] cannot be built [solely] around such a narrowly formulated tactic” (p. 240).   The challenge for deterring through increasing risk of apprehension is to focus on ways of persuading those who are likely to commit offences that they will, indeed, be apprehended if they offend., Conclusion: “There is little evidence that increasing already long prison sentences has a material deterrence effect.  Evidence on the deterrent effect of the certainty of punishment is more consistent… The certainty effect stems primarily from the police functioning in their official guardian role rather than in their apprehension agent role” (p. 252-3).  “Crime control effectiveness would be improved by shifting resources from corrections to policing methods that enhance the effectiveness of police in their official guardian role” (p. 253.

Deviant peers can cause ordinary people to cheat.,", Many studies have found that a strong predictor of offending in youths is whether or not a youth’s friends commit offences.  Those with friends who commit offences do the same.  There are three possible explanations for this finding: youths are influenced by their peers or friends; youths choose friends who are similar to themselves; or youths who are not inclined to offend abandon friends who do offend.  The explanations are not, of course, mutually exclusive., There is, surprisingly, very little strong evidence for the causal inference that seeing deviant peers commit offences causes youths to offend. This study, carried out at an un-named “large public university in the mid-Atlantic region of the US” (p. 482) used an experimental design to determine if exposure to another person who cheated would induce them to cheat., Groups of undergraduate students were recruited for an experiment that they thought involved testing the accuracy of their short-term memory. They were told they could earn up to $20 for their participation in the study.  The students were read 20 words and promised $1 for each word that they correctly recalled later in the hour.  They then were given a short survey to complete on a computer. At this point, the experimenter mentioned that because of a programming error the correct words were accessible (through 4 links on the computer screen in front of each student) and requested that the students not access the link. The experimenter then left the room., For half of the groups of students, a male employee of the experimenter, posing as just another student, told the rest of the group that because he had thought that he had been guaranteed the $20 for participating in the study,  he was going to use the links, thereby getting his full $20 by cheating.  For the other half of the groups, he said nothing and did nothing unusual., In the control condition (where the students knew how to get the answers, but where nobody announced an intention to cheat), nobody in fact cheated.  In the groups where the confederate of the experimenter announced his intention to cheat, 38% of the students cheated. Most of those who cheated took maximum advantage of the opportunity and clicked all 4 of the links they had been asked to ignore., Conclusion: In this experiment, cheating by a peer (who was not a friend) induced 38% of ordinary university students also to cheat in a circumstance where, without negative social influence, nobody cheated.   In other words, at least part of the relationship between the deviance of an individual and the deviance of friends is causal: deviant peers cause ordinary people to commit offences., Reference: Paternoster, Ray, Jean Marie McGloin, Holly Nguyen, and Kyle J.

"Youths who commit criminal offences and have attitudes supportive of offending are more likely than other youths to over-estimate their friends’ involvement in crime.  Those who over-estimate friends’ involvement in crime are more likely, in the future, to commit crime.",", It is well known that youths who commit offences are likely to report that their friends are also involved in crime.  However, there is some evidence that youths do not always know what their friends actually do.  For example, they may “project their own behaviours and attitudes onto others” (p. 336)., This study examined data from 1,046 Dutch youths who were interviewed in their schools in 2002 and again a year later.  They were asked how often, in the previous year, they had committed various offences (theft, assault, break and enter, robbery).  In addition, they were asked to identify who, in their school, they spent time with.  Because their friends were also being interviewed, it was possible to see what crimes were committed by each youth’s friends.  Youths were also asked to report their perceptions of their friends’ involvement in crime by asking them how many of their friends they thought committed each of these same offences., Given that their friends had indicated their own involvement, it was possible to see whether each youth over-estimated, relatively accurately estimated, or under-estimated their friends’ involvement in crime.   Youths were also asked about how bad they thought it was to commit crime by asking whether they agreed with statements such as “It is all right to steal if you need money” (p. 341).  In addition, youths were assessed on how much they felt pressured by friends to engage in particular behaviours by indicating agreement with questions such as “My friends sometimes make me do things I actually don’t want to do.” (p. 342). Various other control variables were also measured., The results show, not surprisingly, that youths holding attitudes supportive of delinquency were more likely to over-estimate their friends involvement in crime as were youths who reported being susceptible to peer pressure.   But in addition, the higher the involvement of a youth in crime, the more likely the youth was to over-estimate their friends’ involvement in crime.  In other words “individuals who engage in delinquency are more likely to incorrectly attribute such behaviour to others” (p. 346)., The importance of friends’ delinquency as well as youths’ estimates of friends’ delinquency on the youth’s own offending can be seen most clearly when using the wave 1 data to predict the youth’s level of offending one year later.  “Friends’ actual delinquency, as well as overestimation of friends’ delinquency, significantly predicted later delinquent behaviour of the respondents” (p. 346).  In addition, “overestimation of friends’ delinquency has a stronger effect on delinquency for youths who are relatively less popular, more strongly value social approval, and feel more pressure from their peers to engage in behaviour” (p. 346)., Conclusion: “Overestimation of friends’ delinquency is a strong predictor of self-reported delinquency one year later” (p. 349).  This effect is strongest for those “who place a high value on social approval, are unpopular, and experience peer pressure” (p. 346).  “Interventions that seek to reduce problem behaviour by providing accurate information about the frequency of behaviours in certain contexts (e.g., schools)… may be most effective for unpopular youth who feel pressured to engage in risky behaviour and who value social approval from others” (p. 350)., Reference: Young, Jacob T.

The predictors of homicide rates in neighbourhoods in a Canadian city with a relatively low homicide rate are very similar to the predictors of neighbourhood homicide rates in cities in the U.S.,", In the United States, studies have found that urban areas “characterized by high levels of economic disadvantage, racial isolation and inequality, and single-parent families and that border on neighbourhoods with high levels of violent crime have higher homicide rates” (p. 89).  Generally speaking, however, these studies have been carried out in relatively high homicide cities.  Chicago, for example, the location of much of the ‘neighbourhood effect’ research, had a homicide rate of 15.2 (victims per 100,000 residents) in 2010.  This study was carried out in Toronto – a city with a homicide rate of 2.2 that year., The overall patterns of homicide rates in the U.S. and Canada for the past 50 years have been very similar (increases until the mid-1970s, and sharp decreases since the early 1990s) even though the U.S. rate has typically been at least 3 times as high. However, there are some differences between homicides in the two countries: Canadian homicide offenders are more likely to use weapons other than firearms, and are more likely to kill women, family members, and intimate partners.  In addition, unlike in the U.S., Canadian small towns and rural areas do not consistently have lower homicide rates than large urban areas., This study examined homicide rates (in 1988-2003) in 140 neighbourhoods in Toronto.  The neighbourhoods were identified by the city’s Social Policy and Research Unit based on main streets, natural or manmade boundaries, and social service areas. The areas were designed to reflect what are experienced as ‘neighbourhoods.’  Homicide rates for the neighbourhoods varied from zero to over 10 victims per 100,000 residents., The simple relationships between homicide rates and social variables were as one might expect from previous research. High homicide rates were associated with low income, high unemployment and high rates of government financial transfers to families, high rates of families moving and low rates of home ownership. In addition, high homicide neighbourhoods had high proportions of residents who were Black and  recent immigrants.  The last finding (a positive relationship between the proportion of immigrants and homicide rate) is different from some US studies and may reflect either different immigration patterns or different settlement patterns., When multivariate analyses were carried out, however, it was found that as soon as economic disadvantage was controlled for, the impact of “% Black” disappeared, implying that the racial ‘effect’ is very likely to be an artefact of economic disadvantage. Similarly, the relationship between a high concentration of immigrants and homicide rates disappeared when economic disadvantage and percent of residents between 15-24 (the ‘homicide prone’ population) were controlled.  In the end, the predictors of the homicide rate in a neighbourhood were economic disadvantage, the proportion of residents who were young, and whether the neighbourhood was adjacent to a high homicide neighbourhood., Conclusion: “Despite the lower levels of lethal violence and spatial inequality in Toronto, the correlates of homicide in Toronto neighbourhoods appear very similar to the neighbourhood-level correlates of homicide in U.S. cities” (p. 109). Although high concentrations of immigrant and Black residents in a neighbourhood were associated with high homicide rates for those neighbourhoods, these relationships disappeared when economic circumstances and age structure were controlled.  However, the somewhat different findings on immigration in Canada and the U.S. underline the importance of being cautious about generalizing across jurisdictions., Reference: Thompson, Sara K. and Rosemary Gartner (2014).

Children can be taught to maintain the accuracy of their evidence even in the face of developmentally inappropriate cross-examination.,", Previous research has found that “the net effect of cross-examination questioning on children’s accuracy [in describing events they have witnessed] is negative, raising concerns about cross-examination as a truth-finding mechanism” (p. 355)., A preliminary study was carried out that involved taking 121 children (age 5-6 or and 9-10) on a field trip.  They were asked questions about it and then cross-examined about it.  Some children were warned about the cross-examination that would take place.  They were told that the interviewer didn’t have first hand information, that the questions might be tricky, and it was all right to tell the interviewer that she had made a mistake. Another group of children received no warning about the nature of the cross-examination. Consistent with previous findings, the older children answered the cross-examination questions more accurately, but the warning had no impact.  Consistent with previous findings, then, it would appear that simple warnings about cross-examination do not improve the accuracy of children’s evidence when being cross examined., The main study – again using 5-6 and 9-10 year olds – involved taking the children for a visit to a police station.  All were then questioned a few days later about what happened at the police station. An average of 10 days later, all children were cross-examined by another interviewer.  However, a day or two before the cross-examination session, half of the children were given training in how to respond to cross-examination.  This consisted of having the child watch a film about a little girl who got lost.  The children were then asked 8 ‘yes-no’ questions about the film. After the first four, the interviewer asked cross-examination style questions (e.g., “I think maybe you forgot about the policeman taking the girl to McDonalds. That’s what really happened isn’t it?”).   Children who correctly answered the question (i.e., in this example, they said that it didn’t happen) were praised for resisting.  If the cross-examination question was answered incorrectly the interviewer showed the part of the film that had the answer and told the child “Just remember, you don’t have to agree with adults when we get things muddled up, okay?”   They were then told that they would be asked questions about the visit to the police station, and were warned that some questions might be tricky and that the interviewer might muddle things up., Children who had been given the training in being cross-examined changed fewer of their answers (from the answer they had given in direct examination).  Most importantly, they changed fewer of the correct answers they had given in direct examination. Generally, older children were more accurate than younger children, especially when being cross-examined.  The most important finding, however, is that for both age groups, the children who received the preparation on how to respond to cross-examination were more accurate in the evidence they gave than the group that received no special training., Conclusion:  Both 5-6 year olds and 9-10 year olds who received training in telling the truth when being cross-examined were more accurate than comparable children who did not get this training. It would seem that some form of formal training (involving experience in being cross-examined) is important; it is not sufficient merely to warn children that adult interviewers can be incorrect.  It is important to remember that this training involved material not related to their ‘testimony’ in the cross-examination; hence the effects cannot be said to be due to coaching or rehearsing. In addition, the training was given by people unfamiliar to the youth.  It emphasized the importance of accuracy (not the importance of consistency of testimony)., Reference: Righarts, Saskia, Sarah O’Neill, and Rachel Zajac (2013).  Addressing the Negative Effect of Cross-Examination Questioning on Children’s Accuracy: Can We Intervene?  Law and Human Behavior, 37(5), 354-365., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV14N2.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-14-no-2-%E2%80%93-march-2014,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 14, No. 2 – March 2014",Regular Issue,2014
"Men who become unemployed are likely to have an increased risk of being involved in property crime, but not other types of crime. However, certain unemployment programs can reduce the impact on crime of being unemployed.",", The meaning of the association between unemployment and crime is unclear in part because it is unclear “whether unemployment causes crime or whether both are a reflection of underlying traits in the people most likely to become unemployed and criminally active” (p. 562).  This paper looks at the impact on offending, within individuals, of periods of unemployment.  But in addition, it looks at the impact of unemployment on crime as a function of the type of unemployment benefits individuals receive., The study uses Finnish data on 15,658 men who were 20-30 years old in 2001. They were followed for 6 years. Three types of unemployment benefits exist in Finland: earnings-related benefits for those who have worked and paid insurance premiums, benefits for those who have worked but not paid insurance, and payments to those who haven’t worked.  Youths typically are in the last category.  Those under 25 years old without secondary education or work experience can be required to attend active training programs in order to receive state support.  Those receiving passive support while unemployed simply receive their payments (about the same amount as those in active job training programs) but don’t have to do any special programs., In general, those with higher rates of unemployment during this 6 year period had, on average, more criminal convictions.  The most sensitive way to look at the impact of unemployment on crime – while, in effect, controlling for individual differences - is to look at those with at least some unemployment during this period and who were involved in at least some crime.  This approach, then, ‘controls’ for differences between those who might have characteristics associated simultaneously with unemployment and crime since it examines only those who have some experience with both unemployment and crime. For this ‘crime prone’ group, then, the question is whether offending occurred during the same period that the person was unemployed. For property crime – but not for violent offending or drinking-driving – unemployment is associated with offending.  However, these results, in comparison with others that are presented suggested that much of the simple relationship between unemployment and crime is the result of between-individual differences on these variables (i.e., that people prone to unemployment are more prone to commit crime than are people not prone to unemployment).  In addition, the relationship between unemployment and property crime is stronger when the person experiences longer periods of unemployment., To determine whether the type of support a young person receives is important, an analysis was restricted to those who received, during this 6-year period, both active and passive unemployment benefits at different times during the follow-up period. Consistent with the hypothesis that being involved in job training programs insulates people from the factors leading to crime, there was less property crime when people were involved in active unemployment programs than when they simply received passive support payments.  However, once again there were no effects on rates of violent or drinking-driving offences., Conclusion:  These results support the view that unemployment is a causal determinant of property crime, but not violent or drinking-driving crime, but that the effect is small compared with stable differences in offending among people.  Furthermore, “programs that actively incorporate young adults into the labour market are promising in reducing [property] crime” (p. 586)., Reference: Aaltonen, Mikko, John M.

The public wants sex offenders to be punished harshly because they are seen as unreformable immoral monsters who prey on young children.,", Punishment policies toward sex offenders in some countries, including Canada, appear to be based more on evidence-free beliefs about the likelihood that sex offenders will re-offend and the overly-optimistic view that special control programs (e.g., registries, community notification, restrictions on residence and movement, etc.) are effective in reducing sex crimes (see the Criminological Highlights collection on sex offenders for evidence about sex offenders).   However, relatively little is known about what drives public views about sex offenders, other than the fact that compared to almost any type of offence, “public attitudes are the most punitive toward sex offenders” (p. 730)., This study examines the relationship between three sets of beliefs about sex offending and punitive attitudes toward sex offenders.  The hypotheses were that holding these beliefs may account for the public’s punitive preferences with regard to the control of sex crime. The beliefs that were examined were: that sex offenders almost invariably chose young female victims who are permanently damaged as a result of the crime; that sex offenders are evil, unreformable strangers preying, without remorse,  on vulnerable people; and that rates of sex crime are increasing and it is very difficult to control sex offending., In a recent survey, 537 Americans were asked to report their support for 7 punitive responses to sex offending (e.g., banning sex offenders from using the internet; death penalty for repeat sex offenders).  They were also questioned about their support for sex offender treatment (e.g., making more programs available in prison; increasing taxes to pay for sex offender rehabilitation programs)., “Punitiveness toward sex offenders tended to be higher among individuals who (1) perceived that a larger proportion of sex crime victims are young children, (2) believed that such victims suffer more than victims of other crimes, (3) endorsed stereotypes of sex offenders as unreformable and driven to crime by immorality, and (4) judged that sex crimes have increased over the previous 5 years. The results revealed that sex offender stereotypes, particularly the stereotype of sex offenders as unreformable, may play the most prominent role in generating hostility toward persons convicted of sex crimes” (p. 749-750).  In addition, women and conservatives tended to be more supportive of punitive sex crime laws., Support for sex offender treatment, on the other hand, is related only to one set of beliefs: disagreement with the view that sex offenders are inherently immoral and unreformable. Independent of these effects, however, those who identify themselves as conservative are less likely to support treatment for sex offenders., Conclusion: The evidence suggests that support for punitive policies toward sex offenders is fuelled more by “moral outrage, and thus the desire for retribution.” But the findings also support “utilitarian accounts of punitiveness, which specify that punitive policies often receive public support because of their presumed crime control benefits” even though research has shown that these benefits are almost certainly illusory. Overall the results demonstrate that “No single impetus drives views about punishing sex offenders” (p. 750)., Reference: Pickett, Justin T., Christina Mancini, and Daniel P. Mears (2013).

Why do so many cases involving minor offences end up without a finding of guilt?  Because the justice system has found ways of exercising its power to punish without the need to prove guilt.,"In New York City close to 50% of misdemeanour arrests do not result in a finding of guilt.  In Canada, about 32% of all adult criminal cases result in all charges being stayed or withdrawn (22% for multiple charge cases; 47% for single charge cases).  Given that these cases don’t result in formal punishment, it would be easy – but wrong – to assume that they aren’t taken seriously.  Aside from anything else, often a lot of effort is spent in processing them before the charges are dismissed., Most misdemeanour arrests in New York involve minor charges. About 70% involve marijuana or other controlled substances, thefts, or minor assaults. They disproportionally involve Black and Hispanic defendants from neighbourhoods with high crime rates and a large proportion of non-white residents. The most common disposition of these cases is “Adjournment in Contemplation of Dismissal” (ACD), in which the case is adjourned, with consent, for a specified period (up to 6 or 12 months) sometimes with conditions that the defendant must meet before the charges are dismissed., Within this formal structure, however, a number of different penal techniques are employed that “can be accomplished without the burden of securing a conviction” (p. 388)., The first technique – marking – identifies the defendant as someone involved in the criminal justice system. Hence a proposed ACD for one year identifies the person as someone who has had contact with the justice system and as someone who received an ACD – a fact that is used in deciding what to do if the defendant is arrested in the future.  In addition, because the person’s case is technically open,  it is accessible online to anyone, and therefore this disposition can and does sometimes affect current or future employment. This is done “without having to satisfy all of the legal burdens of proving guilt or using resources for sentence or formal monitoring” (p. 374)., A second technique – procedural hassle – happens almost inevitably. Being initially detained, or waiting all day (and missing one or more day’s work or having to arrange child care) “for their 60-120 seconds in front of the judge” are examples. For example, a defendant was charged with possession of a prohibited weapon (a gravity knife that was seized from him when he was arrested). He was offered an ACD but he refused it because he maintained that it was not a gravity knife.  Only after 8 months and 8 court appearances did the prosecutor examine the knife, only then to ‘discover’ that, indeed, the defendant was correct.  It would appear that prosecutors believe that defendants ‘earn’ the dismissal of their case “by way of the procedural hassle… monitoring, testing, and imposing costly inconveniences on the defendant” (p. 379)., Finally, defendants are made subject to performance – the requirement “that the defendant discharge some duty, assigned task, program activity or therapeutic undertaking” (p. 381).  “In practice, the content of the performance is not always as important as the requirement that the defendant undertakes some burdensome task and comes back to court to prove compliance” (p. 383)., Conclusion: Prisons, fines, and other formal sentences constitute only one way in which the justice system punishes.  Probation and parole populations are “routinely constrained and routinely inspected for fitness to maintain their limited liberty…” (p. 355).  “A felony conviction often restructures the rights of citizenship… [and]  is almost always a permanent mark” (p. 355). With minor cases, the system has other methods that do not require findings of guilt.  These techniques demonstrate “the malleable social control capacity of criminal justice institutions… [Thus the] swelling of dismissed cases does not represent a failure of juridical punishment or the runoff from an overburdened system, but a creative deployment of the tools available in the criminal process for the task of social regulation” (p. 387)., Reference: Kohler-Hausmann, Issa (2013).  Misdemeanour Justice: Control without Conviction.  American Journal of Sociology, 119(2), 351-393., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV14N3.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-14-no-3-%E2%80%93-june-2014,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 14, No. 3 – June 2014",Regular Issue,2014
A targeted pre-school program had beneficial effects for the next 40 years.,", Few knowledgeable people believe that the best way to reduce crime is through investments in the criminal justice system.  Even though harsh penalties including imprisonment do not appear to be effective means of addressing crime (see the collections of Criminological Highlights on these subjects), a reasonable question might be: what else can be done?  This paper demonstrates that investments in a two year pre-school program for “at risk” children can have lasting effects., Children from low socioeconomic status African-American families who showed low intellectual performance at age 3-4 were recruited into the study and were then randomly assigned either to receive a pre-school program or no program. Program children attended school daily for 2.5 hours for two years.  In addition, the teachers in the children’s school visited the program children’s homes once a week to talk to parents and engage them in the education process.  The goal of the program might be described as focusing school and family efforts on the development of the child’s cognitive and social skills. The control group received the normal educational and social services available to anyone in the community.  The participants and control group have now been followed for 40 years in order to see whether the experiences had long term effects., People who had been randomly assigned to the program group at age 3-4 were more likely to graduate from high school (or equivalent) than children in the control group.  Compared to the control group, at age 40 the program group was more likely to be employed, have higher incomes, and own their own homes.  In addition, by age 40, the program group was less likely to have been arrested for violent, property or drug crimes.  Generally speaking these effects held for both males and females.  Furthermore, the program participants were less likely to have been sentenced to prison or jail and, generally speaking, were less likely to have spent long periods on probation or in prison., It appears that the preschool experience improved participants’ early childhood intellectual experience. This in turn, improved commitment to schooling at age 15 and performance in school as a teenager.  Higher educational achievement led to higher earnings and less involvement in crime.  Obviously, there were criminal justice savings from the program. For example, 52% of the control group was sentenced to at least some time in jail or prison compared to 28% of the program group. 23% of the control group was sentenced to prison for more than 2 years, compared to only 12% of the program group.  In 2013 dollars, the program cost $20,019 per participant. An analysis suggests that much more than this was saved in criminal justice costs alone., Conclusion:  Other studies have demonstrated that investment in the lives of children early in their lives can have crime reduction effects (Criminological Highlights 1(5)#6, 4(2)#1) along with other benefits. The detailed data from this study, and from others, suggest that the effects of interventions in the lives of young children can be long-lasting and some of the beneficial effects may not be evident until decades after the end of the program.  It appears, however, that necessary ingredients for success in this program were that it involved “fully qualified or well-supervised teachers using a proven curriculum model, engaging parents as partners, and regularly assessing program implementation and children’s development” (p. 404)., Reference: Schweinhart, Lawrence J.

"An evaluation of the Gang Resistance Education and Training (G.R.E.A.T) program suggests that the program reduced gang membership in some, but not all, cities, but had no impact on youths’ involvement in crime.",", The Gang Resistance Education and Training (G.R.E.A.T) program has received a fair amount of favourable publicity in part because it is a relatively inexpensive, school-based, prevention program that was implemented as part of a randomized control trial, thus allowing it to be evaluated properly.  Designed to reduce gang membership, the program involves about 13 classroom lessons to youths in Grade 6 or 7.  The program is typically presented by police officers., In 31 schools in 7 American cities, 195 classrooms were randomly assigned either to receive the G.R.E.A.T. program or not.  The youths from these classrooms were then followed for 4 years. Each time they were interviewed, the youths were asked about gang membership, general delinquency, and violent delinquency.  “Gang membership” was measured with one question  -- “Are you now in a gang?” (p. 384).  Delinquency was measured with 14 questions that captured both the variety of types of delinquency the youth engaged in as well as the frequency of involvement in offending. In this paper, the effects one year and four years after the end of the program were reported., Pooling across the 7 cities, there was a significant reduction in self-reported gang involvement. One year after the end of the program, 6.4% of the control group and 3.8% of the treatment group reported being in gangs (p. 430).  Four years after the treatment, the effect was still significant, but it was smaller.  However, these favourable effects held for only 3 of the 7 sites one year after the end of the program, and 2 of the 7 sites 4 years after the end of the program., Though youths in some cities were somewhat less likely to report joining gangs if they were exposed to the program, there were no differences in delinquency (overall or violent; frequency or the variety of types) between the youths who received the program and those who did not. In fact, using the traditional definition of statistical significance, in only one city, on one of the four measures, was there a favourable effect of the program.  But in another city, those who participated in the program reported more involvement in delinquency on this same measure.  The safest conclusion would appear to be that the program had no impact on delinquency., Conclusion:  Previous research (see Criminological Highlights 4(1)#8, 3(1)#5, 8(6)#3) has demonstrated that “membership” in a gang can mean very different things to different youths.  Hence it is not too surprising to find that a program might affect self-reported gang membership, but not self-reported delinquency.  As other researchers have noted, “Gang prevention is not synonymous with delinquency prevention” (Criminological Highlights 8(3)#3).  One of the attractive aspects of the G.R.E.A.T program is that it is a relatively small and inexpensive intervention into the lives of youths. However, this implies that it is reasonable to expect that the effects of the program would not be large.  Nevertheless, as one commentator put it, “The inconvenient truth is that G.R.E.A.T. had no effect on the… delinquency… scores [or the] inventory of violent delinquency… scores which included an item asking whether respondents had been “involved in gang fights” (p. 430).  “What is the value of a program that causes some kids to disavow gang membership but does not reduce criminal offending?” (p. 428)., References:  Esbensen, Finn-Aage, D.

People are more willing to relax the standard of proof necessary for a verdict of guilt when the offence is a very serious one.,", The saying that it is “Better that 10 guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer” is attributed to the 18th century English jurist Sir William Blackstone.  Nevertheless, “There is no agreement about the exact level of certainty required for a guilty conviction” (p. 34).  In fact, in one British survey 36% of respondents indicated that they believed that it is worse to let a guilty person go free than to convict an innocent person. This paper explores the possibility that the level of certainty that people believe should be required for a conviction varies with characteristics of the case being decided., In this study, ordinary Dutch citizens, travelling on intercity trains, were given questionnaires containing crime vignettes.  It was pointed out in the questionnaires that often a judge “cannot be completely certain about the suspect’s guilt or innocence.  Therefore, it is possible that individuals who are guilty will be acquitted and individuals who are innocent will be convicted. How often these two judicial errors occur depends on standards of proof…. It is sometimes stated that it is better to acquit 20 guilty people than to convict one innocent person.  On this statement, opinions vary” (p. 39).   Participants were then asked, for each of 3 offences – a shoplifting, a burglary, and a rape -- “How many guilty people in similar cases should be acquitted in order to prevent one innocent person from wrongful conviction?”, In addition, some of the participants were given information that made salient the consequences of wrongful convictions or wrongful acquittals. Some were given information on both types of possible errors; other participants were given neither type of information.  As it turns out, information on the consequences of errors had no impact on participants’ judgements of the ‘Blackstone ratio.’, The results show that as the seriousness of the offence increases, the ‘Blackstone ratio’ – the number of guilty persons who should be acquitted to prevent one innocent person from being convicted’ – decreases.  For shoplifting the ratio was 9 people could be wrongfully acquitted to avoid one wrongful conviction; for burglary it was 7, and for rape, it was only 6 people.  In other words, people use a lower standard of proof necessary for a guilty finding for very serious crimes (like rape) than they do for less serious crimes (like shoplifting).  However, there was little consensus about the appropriate ‘standard’ for any crime.  For example, in the rape case, 45% of the respondents were unwilling to acquit any guilty person to prevent one wrongful conviction, but 14% were willing to take the chance of acquitting 10 or more in that same case., Conclusion: “The public subscribes to a dynamic decision criterion which varies systematically with crime seriousness.  A lower standard of proof is desired in the case of more serious crime” (p. 44).  Since judges are, presumably, expected to maintain an unchanging standard of proof  that is not affected by the seriousness of the offence, it would appear that the public – when they are not acting as decision makers – is more flexible than judges are supposed to be in defining what should be the required standard of proof. These data obviously address issues of how ordinary citizens view standards of proof. Data from studies of juries in the US and England suggest that when making actual decisions, ordinary jurors are, overall, less likely to convict than judges (See Baldwin & McConvillle Jury Trials and Kalven & Zeisel The American Jury)., Reference: De Keijser, Jan W., Evianne GM de Lange, and Johan A. van Wilsem (2014).

"A study of homicide in Buffalo, New York, from 1950-2000, demonstrates that even after controlling for socioeconomic disadvantage, African American neighbourhoods became increasingly vulnerable, over time, to high homicide rates.",", Do neighbourhood social and economic conditions have equivalent impacts on neighbourhood violence rates irrespective of their racial composition?  One reason for thinking that the racial composition of neighbourhoods is important is that neighbourhoods with high concentrations of African Americans may have characteristics, aside from race, that set them apart.  For example, it has been noted that “racial and ethnic groups have substantially different abilities to distance themselves from unfavourable urban social conditions” (p. 492)., This study examines homicide rates in the neighbourhoods of Buffalo, NY, in the last 5 decades of the 20th century, a period of economic decline in a city that lost 44% of its population and went from having about 4% of its population African-American to about 29%.  For this 50 year period, the location of each homicide in Buffalo was determined.  Various socioeconomic characteristics and the racial breakdown of each census tract for each of the 5 decades were also obtained., With these data, then, it was possible to investigate “whether neighbourhood racial composition influences changes in the location and concentration of violence within cities over time” (p. 495).  Although it has been demonstrated that homicide rates in a given location are associated with homicide rates in nearby locations, it is not known how these effects play out in neighbourhoods over time.  In particular, the design of this study made it possible to determine whether, in a highly segregated city like Buffalo, neighbourhoods with high concentrations of African Americans were particularly vulnerable to becoming more violent over the course of 50 years, above and beyond any effects of their socio-economic characteristics., “Neighbourhood homicide levels are strongly related to poverty and other aspects of socioeconomic disadvantage” (p. 502) during most of this 50 year period.  Controlling for socioeconomic characteristics of the neighbourhood, homicide rates were higher in neighbourhoods with high concentrations of African American residents. Neighbourhoods close to neighbourhoods with high homicide rates tended, themselves, to have high homicide rates. Neighbourhoods that had high homicide rates in one decade tended to have high homicide rates in subsequent decades.  Only when changes over a 30 year period were examined was it possible to see substantial shifts in whether a neighbourhood had a relatively high homicide rate.  However, “African American neighbourhoods experienced heightened risk of violence diffusion [from nearby neighbourhoods] as the century drew to a close, irrespective of local socioeconomic conditions” (p. 507)., Conclusion: The vulnerability of predominantly African American communities to becoming high violence neighbourhoods appears to have occurred most dramatically in the latter part of the 20th century. These neighbourhoods were, at that time, particularly susceptible because of their exposure to highly violent nearby communities.  “For this reason, residents of predominantly African American neighbourhoods in Buffalo have found themselves in neighbourhoods distinguished by elevated levels of violence, irrespective of the neighbourhood’s class status” (p. 508)., Reference: Griffiths, Elizabeth (2013).   Race, Space, and the Spread of Violence Across the City.  Social Problems, 60 (4), 491-512., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV14N3.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-14-no-3-%E2%80%93-june-2014,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 14, No. 3 – June 2014",Regular Issue,2014
"One Canadian province, Alberta, reduced its prison population in the 1990s by 32% with no negative consequences.",", Incarceration rates are largely the result of policy choices by those in power and have little to do with crime rates (Criminological Highlights 12(3)#2, 6(1)#7), 3(5)#1, 13(4)#8).  This is not to suggest, however, that imprisonment policies relate in a simple manner to the ‘right-left’ orientation of the party in power (Criminological Highlights 12(1)#5).  This paper examines the decarceration that took place in the mid-1990s in Canada’s most conservative province, Alberta, soon after one of its long-serving premiers, Ralph Klein, assumed power in 1992., The impetus for reducing the number of prisoners in Alberta’s provincial correctional institutions was that the newly elected provincial premier had made a commitment to balance the budget by cutting expenditures in all government departments – including the justice ministry – by about 20%.  He refused to raise taxes, even though Alberta taxes are relatively low.  Canadian imprisonment rates had been fairly stable for decades in part because imprisonment was considered to be a necessary, but not a very effective, response to offending (Criminological Highlights 8(2)#6).  A reduction in imprisonment per se was not the ultimate goal of government actions; justice expenditures simply needed to be cut and the reduction in imprisonment was the natural consequence., Many of the changes that were made to accomplish the provincial justice department’s expenditure reduction goal were part of a “Serious and Violent Crime Initiative” instituted by provincial officials.  In Canada, offenders sentenced to at least 2 years in prison are sent to penitentiaries run and paid for by the federal government. Hence there was no need to change the manner in which the province’s most serious offenders were handled.  The focus, instead, could be on the less serious offenders. From the civil servants’ perspective, therefore, the required change in approach was welcomed as an opportunity to implement good policy. The closing of two provincial prisons signalled the need to change prosecutorial and correctional policies.  Minor cases were diverted from the formal justice system.  Alternatives to short (i.e., provincial) prison sentences were identified and recommended, by probation officers, to sentencing judges. Prisoners were released early from prison, often with various punitive controls (e.g., house arrest or requirements that they spend their days in attendance centres)., Ministers of the conservative government focused, in their public statements, on the positive aspects of the policy, referring to it as a “cost effective and progressive approach to corrections while ensuring the protection of the public…” (p. 17).  The justice minister noted that “there are other ways of dealing with some of the criminal activity… that are more effective than putting a person in jail” (p. 15).  He noted that the policy of more selective use of incarceration “is much more effective in changing behaviour than just having someone for a minor offence being put in jail… The issue is how effective is prison and are there alternatives which are better…” (p. 19)., Conclusion: A dramatic reduction in the use of imprisonment took place in Alberta in a short period of time. In 1992, there were 23,711 sentenced admissions to provincial institutions; in 1997 there were only 14,467. There was no evidence of an increase in admissions to federal institutions for those given long sentences during this period.  Though the catalyst for the change in provincial imprisonment policy may have been budgetary, the context in which the change occurred – including Canadian governments’ scepticism about the value of imprisonment –  allowed the reduction to happen without difficulty., Reference:  Webster, Cheryl Marie and Anthony N. Doob (2014). Penal Reform ‘Canadian Style’: Fiscal Responsibility and Decarceration in Alberta, Canada.

Prisoners who are involved in violence when in prison are likely to believe that “maintaining a tough identity is critical for securing the respect of others” (p. 699).,", The determination of the security level in which prisoners are to be held is typically accomplished by looking at such characteristics as their age, the offences that brought them to prison, their criminal history and prior infractions while in prison.  Typically, prison officials do not consider the values held by the prisoner that, from the prisoner’s perspective, are important for surviving in violent communities., This paper looks at the relationship between “the code of the street” – a tough or violent demeanor designed to deter others from even thinking about challenging them in any way – and violent acts in prison.  The ‘code’ includes a commitment to “respect, toughness, and retribution” (p. 699). In this study, adherence to the ‘code’ was measured by ascertaining prisoners’ agreement with questions such as  “It is important not to back down from a fight or challenge because people will not respect you” and “People do not respect a person who is afraid to fight physically for his or her rights” (p. 706-7)., As part of a larger longitudinal study in Iowa and Georgia, people who were interviewed in their communities at age 20 were assessed on their acceptance of the code of the street. Four years later, they were interviewed again and it was found that 219 people had been incarcerated at some point in the previous 4 years. As part of the interview that took place when they were 24, they indicated, using a ‘life calendar’ method, how many times they had engaged in various violent acts in recent years.  32% of the sample of people who had been imprisoned reported engaging in one or more violent acts while incarcerated. These included threats (24% of the sample), physical fights with other prisoners (16%) and physical fights with correctional officers (6%)., Greater adherence to the street code was associated with the amount of violence a prisoner engaged in while in custody even when various background characteristics (e.g., sex, neighbourhood disadvantage, prior violent offending)  were controlled for. The relationship also held when characteristics of the offence, sentence length, and prior incarcerations were controlled.  Prisoners involved in gangs in the institutions and prisoners with little family support (few visits, phone calls and letters from family members) were more likely to be violent. However, above and beyond those effects, adherence to the ‘code of the street’ was still related to violence within the institution.  The effect of the ‘code’ was greater for those prisoners who had little family support and were involved with gangs., Conclusion: The beliefs that prisoners held when they arrived in prison on how they should respond to disrespect, threats, and violence from others predicts their involvement in violence in prison.  Educational and vocational programming in prison, as well as involvement with organized religion, had no apparent impact on prison violence or on the relationship between belief in the ‘code of the street’ and prison violence.  What is not known, however, is whether the prison experience has an impact on adherence to the ‘code’., Reference: Mears, Daniel P., Eric A.

"The number of hate crimes in the US spikes almost immediately after certain contentious events (e.g., high profile controversial trials and lethal terrorist attacks) but not others (e.g., court decisions granting rights to same sex couples).",", “Hate crimes often are defensive in nature and are precipitated by an affront to one demographic group by another… In essence they are partly an expression of informal social control” by one group over another (p. 872).  Furthermore, it has been suggested that the targets of hate crimes “amount to forms of collective liability in which innocents are attacked simply because they belong to a particular group” (p. 873)., Hate crimes, according to one theory, would be expected to occur in situations in which “the group harbouring the grievance cannot turn to the law to rectify the conflict or otherwise find closure” (p. 874).  This study identifies events that might “stoke anger or represent an affront to another group” (p. 875).  These events, however, need to have a clearly definable group to be associated with the triggering event.  The hypothesis is that immediately after these events there might be a spike in the number of hate-motivated crimes against that group., Two contentious trials were identified: the acquittal of white police officers charged with the violent beating of Rodney King, an African American; and the acquittal of the African American, O. J. Simpson who had been charged with killing two white victims.  For anti-Arab/Muslim hate crimes, four events were identified including the 9/11 events.   Finally, in order to examine anti-gay hate crimes, two court decisions ruling in favour of benefits for same sex couples were examined., In the Rodney King case, there was a dramatic spike in anti-white hate crimes that hit a peak within four days but dropped dramatically thereafter, returning to normal levels within about a month.  During the four days after the O.J. Simpson verdict, anti-Black hate crimes increased about 60%, but dropped to near normal within about a week.   Although both events occurred in Southern California, the backlash hate crimes occurred across the United States, presumably because of the vast media attention both events received., The hate crimes targeting Arabs and Muslims after lethal terrorist attacks in the U.S. (one of which was initially, but incorrectly, widely attributed to Arabs/Muslims) showed a similar pattern: an almost immediate effect – i.e., large numbers of hate crimes against Arabs/Muslims on the day of the attack – that largely dissipated within about 10 days.  Obviously, the best known of these events were the 9/11 attacks, but the effects were similar after all four events., However, two separate court decisions, in 1999 and 2003, ruling that same-sex couples were entitled to the same benefits as heterosexual couples had no effects on anti-gay hate crimes.  One reason for this may be that in cases such as these there are no obvious “perpetrators” (or members of the group) who can be easily identified (as members of racial groups could be identified)., It may be then, that for hate crimes to be triggered by some event, there must be a ‘grievance’ by one group against another and there must be an identifiable out-group to which responsibility for the event could be attributed. In addition, there must be sufficient publicity for people to hear about the event., Conclusion:  The targets of hate crimes are people who share what is seen as a common characteristic with those who are believed (correctly or not) to be responsible for an affront against another group.  The spike in the frequency of hate crimes with these people as targets occurs very soon after the triggering event but does not appear to last very long. In fact, in the first 10 years in which hate crime data were available in the US, 66% of the 691 hate crimes with an anti-Islamic motive happened between September 11 and December 31, 2001 (3% of this 10 year period)., Reference: King, Ryan D. and Gretchen M.

People who are sent to prison are less likely to participate fully in their communities and in civic life after they are released.,"It is well established that prisons have harmful effects both on those imprisoned and on their families (see The Effects of Imprisonment: Specific Deterrence and Collateral Effects. Research Summaries Compiled from Criminological Highlights on our website). This paper extends that work and examines the impact of contact with the criminal justice system – and imprisonment in particular – on political participation and trust in government. “For many citizens, their most frequent, visible, and direct contact with government may be through a prison, court, or police station, rather than a welfare office, state capital, or city hall” (p. 818). Given the number of people around the world who have been imprisoned, it is important to consider whether the lessons they learn from that experience are not ones that serve the community at large., There is evidence that people see government as “one big system” (p. 819) and may not differentiate among departments or agencies. If that is the case, then negative experiences with one arm of the government may be generalized to other parts of the government which, in turn, may affect one’s willingness to be civically engaged.  Those who have been imprisoned are likely to feel rejected by society in both subtle and obvious ways.  Imprisonment can communicate to people that they are not full members of the community. For example, in some states, convicted felons are not allowed to vote (Criminological Highlights 5(5)#1), and in many more they are prohibited from voting while in prison or while serving sentences in the community., This study used data from two different longitudinal surveys to classify people according to their highest level of contact with the criminal justice system: No encounters with the police, stopped by police, charged, convicted, spent time in prison, or spent a year or more in prison.  People were also asked about their political involvement (registering to vote, voting, involved in civic or political organizations).  Respondents were also asked questions measuring their trust in government., Various sophisticated methods were used to group respondents who were similar on all dimensions except that of primary interest to the researchers:  involvement with the criminal justice system.  These groups were then compared on their civic engagement and trust in the government. Before controls were imposed, the data are clear: the higher the involvement in the criminal justice system, the less likely it is that people registered to vote, voted, or participated in some civic or political activity, and the less likely that people had trust in federal, state, or local government.  More important, even when race, age, education, income, unemployment, drug use, and other variables were controlled, the results were the same. Furthermore, those sent to prison, especially for a long time, were least likely to trust government or be involved in civic activities when they had an opportunity to do so., There are strong reasons to believe that these effects are causal. One analysis, for example, took advantage of the longitudinal nature of the data to identify people who at the time of the first interview had not had any contact with the criminal justice system. The next time they were interviewed, at Time 2, those who had experienced criminal justice contact were compared with those who had not.  At Time 1, the political attitudes and behaviours of the two groups were identical.  At Time 2 – after one group had experienced contact with the criminal justice system – the two groups differed. Contact reduced trust and reduced involvement in political activities., Conclusion: The negative impacts of imprisonment on civic involvement (e.g., voting) or trust in government are large.  “The effect of being incarcerated [on political involvement]… is larger in size than having a college-educated parent, being in the military, receiving welfare and being black…. It is not just that custodial populations come from disadvantaged backgrounds or are prevented from voting due to felon exclusions; the results point to the large independent effect of punitive encounters that does not depend on pre-existing characteristics….” (p. 827)., Reference: Weaver, Vesla M. and Amy E.

Public opinion about crime and punishment matters: Data from the US suggest that American legislators between 1953 and 2012 responded to increased concern in the general public about crime and that changes in imprisonment were affected by these public attitudes.,", Incarceration rates are largely driven by policy decisions made, typically, by elected officials. What, then, is the role of public opinion?  Two positions have been argued. First it has been suggested that politicians lead public opinion on this issue –for example, creating policies, and selling arguments to the public that support high incarceration – and that the public follows their political leaders.  Second, the opposite has been suggested: that politicians respond to demands from the public for harsher criminal justice policies.  This paper, using US data, argues that the second explanation is more accurate., There are many reasons to expect that, in the US at least, public opinion is an important cause of increased imprisonment.  First, in 24 states, the public can have direct impact on criminal justice policies by way of ballot initiatives.  The original 3-strikes law in California was implemented in this way (Criminological Highlights 1(2)#5). If such laws are popular among members of the public, there may be pressure in neighbouring states for similar laws.  Judges and prosecutors in many states are elected and may respond to public pressure simply to stay in office.  Furthermore, it is unlikely that the sustained support for more punitive policies over a long period of time from both political parties in the US would have occurred had there not been support from the public., Studying the effects of public opinion about crime is difficult because straightforward measures of ‘public punitiveness’ are not available consistently over a long period of time. Instead, this study uses multiple questions asked occasionally over long periods of time to form an overall index of public punitiveness.  Four dimensions were examined: criminals’ rights and the punishment of criminals, support for the death penalty, views about spending on crime and the criminal justice system, and confidence and trust in the police and the criminal justice system. Results were gathered from a number of public opinion organizations for the period 1953-2012.  The patterns for the four dimensions over time were relatively similar suggesting that these four dimensions reflect common underlying attitudes related to being tough on crime., New admissions to prisons were used as the main incarceration measure because they reflect contemporaneous decisions better than do counts of prisoners. [Counts reflect not only recent decisions, but decisions made some time earlier.] The results show that changes in the rate of prison admissions correlate very highly with attitudes of the public: “Support for being tough on crime explains over 30% of the changes in the incarceration rate” (p. 9).  This simple relationship holds even after controlling for other potential determinants of imprisonment rates: various crime measures, economic inequality, and political party support., Congressional hearings related to crime were used as a measure of political attention to crime and imprisonment.  The data suggest that “shifts in the public’s punitiveness appear to precede shifts in congressional attention to crime” (p. 12).  “The public’s rising punitiveness offers a theoretical framework for understanding why interest groups and policy makers have advanced policies that have led the U.S. to become the most punitive country in the world” (p. 13). They did so, apparently, because they decided to follow public opinion., Conclusion: This paper’s finding that “The public’s rising punitiveness appears to be a fundamental determinant of the incarceration rate” (p. 13) is important in that it provides evidence that political leaders followed rather than led the public.   This conclusion is somewhat different from that in an earlier study (Criminological Highlights 14(1)#4) that found that presidential statements about crime tended to precede changes in public sentiment. It may be, of course, that both are true and that the relationships among public views, elite views, and changes in policy are not simple or unidirectional., Reference:  Enns, Peter K.  The Public’s Increasing Punitiveness and Its Influence on Mass Incarceration in the United States.  American Journal of Political Science (in press: Published online 5 March 2014)., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV14N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-14-no-4-%E2%80%93-august-2014,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 14, No. 4 – August 2014",Regular Issue,2014
California’s increase in imprisonment in the latter part of the 20th century started after a key legislative reform – determinate sentencing – had been put in place.   This shift to determinate sentencing appears to have created opportunities for laws that led to more punitive penal policies.,", Policies that govern imprisonment in the US are largely state policies, because only about 8% of US prisoners have been convicted of federal crimes. This paper provides a detailed account of the changes in California’s criminal laws and policies., Prior to the 1970s, California was “hailed as one of the states most firmly committed to rehabilitative principles” in its penal system (p. 386). Indeed, even Ronald Reagan was happy to celebrate the reduction in imprisonment that occurred during his first term as governor (Criminological Highlights 12(1)#5).  Indeterminate sentencing, which had been in existence since 1917, was seen as key for achieving rehabilitative goals. It allowed judges to assign a wide-ranging period in prison. An administrative parole authority determined each prisoner’s actual length of time in prison based on assessments of their rehabilitation. In the early 1970s, however, “Critics from across the political spectrum attacked indeterminate sentencing” (p. 388) and before the decade was over, it was abolished., The initial legislation creating determinate sentencing was “fraught with uncertainty and conflict over who would ultimately have the power to establish sentencing ranges” (p. 388-9). Prosecutors and police wanted the legislature (which by then was controlled by the Democrats) to set the terms of imprisonment people would serve. They also wanted longer prison terms.  The legislative committee considering the bill heard evidence from experts who questioned whether longer sentences would reduce crime.  In addition, as the chair of the legislative committee considering the bill pointed out, the legislature “has neither the expertise, the temperament, the continuing interest, nor the insulation from political pressures that are necessary to establish – and maintain over the years – a rational sentencing structure” (p. 390). He was almost certainly proven to be correct., Nevertheless, in 1976, the determinate sentencing bill was amended in a manner that retained mandatory sentence enhancements, limited judicial discretion, and gave the legislature power to set sentencing ranges.  The Democratic governor was “aware of California’s populist traditions” and the bill became law in 1976.  Nevertheless, opposition to the determinate sentencing law (DSL) that passed included right-wing spokespersons  as well as the California American Civil Liberties Union.  As much as the shift to DSLs are seen as responsible for increases in imprisonment in the US, the events surrounding the passage of the DSL in California do not support the view that there was a deliberate effort to create an oppressive penal regime. Indeed, the passage of the DSL “does not seem to reflect a wave of public demands for longer sentences…. Its passage was not the fruit of extensive public campaigns…” (p. 393) as would be the case with a ballot initiative in 1982.  “What was radical was that [the DSL] restructured the institutional processes that would establish sentencing ranges in the legislature where they were immediately subject to interest group activism and, ultimately, populist pressures” (p. 394).   In other words, while the DSL set the stage for populist increases in sentencing, the original DSL was not, in itself, responsible for prison population growth., By 1981, however, California’s Democratic governor clearly linked crime reduction to tough sentencing measures, such that “at one point, nearly one-third of all bills introduced were crime related” (p. 395) Furthermore, legislators appeared to be willing to pay for increased imprisonment, one noting that “sometimes we just have to bite the unpalatable bullet on essential issues” (p. 398)., Conclusion: California’s imprisonment rate increased as a result of legislative changes that followed and were made possible by the determinate sentencing law (DSL). Legislators saw harsh sentences as the way to solve the crime problem.  Attempts to mitigate the impact on prison populations failed. The drop in crime in California in the early 1980s was attributed, by politicians and conservative economists, to the new harsh penalties. Furthermore, “The [California] Governor essentially redefined overcrowded prisons as indicators of success, not correctional failure or penal excess” (p. 401).  Although the sentencing ranges in the original DSL were seen as too lenient by some, the law opened the door to increased prison populations., Reference: Campbell, Michael C.

"Providing work opportunities to heavy drug users reduces their offending, but does little to reduce cocaine and heroin use.",", Providing work opportunities to offenders or those involved in drugs is always controversial, especially in periods of relatively high unemployment. Programs that provide jobs to those seen as undeserving – drug offenders for example – may need to justify themselves by providing evidence that that they reduce crime. The question raised by this paper is whether providing jobs to recently incarcerated, unemployed, heavy drug users reduces crime and drug use., Work might reduce people’s involvement in crime as a result of a number of different factors. Those receiving jobs may have less time to engage in criminal activities.  Work may increase informal social controls, by strengthening the social ties that those who are given jobs have with non-offenders.  However, while some studies show favourable impacts of work programs, the effect is not uniform for all groups (see Criminological Highlights 4(3)#6, 6(3)#6, 6(5)#7)., This study uses data that were collected in the 1970s.  Members of a group of drug-involved offenders were randomly assigned to an experimental group who were offered “supported work”, or subsidized jobs (typically in construction or manufacturing).  They, and the control group that were not offered jobs, were also involved in drug treatment programs.  All participants had been incarcerated and all were unemployed., More than half of both groups completed the three year follow-up period without using drugs.  However, the proportions of the two groups that reported using drugs during this three year follow-up were similar.  In other words, the supported work program “had little effect on relapse to cocaine or heroin use” (p. 113)., However, the ‘supported work’ group was significantly less likely to be arrested for any crime, including robbery or burglary.   Differences in arrest rates showed up after about 9 months and the size of the difference increased over time. At the end of the 18 month period (during which the members of one group were guaranteed jobs under the supported work program) 26% of those offered subsidized jobs had been arrested for any crime compared to 32% of the control group.  Only 7% of those who received subsidized jobs were arrested for robbery or burglary compared to 13% in the control group.  The difference between the two groups continued to the end of the 3-year follow-up period.  Other analyses suggest that the difference is, in large part, due to the difference in the income available to members of the two groups., Although the data suggest that providing jobs reduced offending, the jobs program had little impact on drug use. Data from another more contemporary study using interviews with drug users suggested that combining drug use with work was very difficult.   However, even though it was difficult, work was seen as necessary to keep from returning to a life of selling and using drugs.  What may have happened is that “the basic controls and structure provided by the supported work program may in fact have held drug use in check, while the income provided by the program curtailed involvement in systematic economic crime” (p. 122)., Conclusion: Clearly the long term success of any transitional job program such as this one depends in large part on the ability of the labour market to absorb the workers at the end of the program.  What is notable about this program, however, is that “it provides strong evidence for a causal relationship between work and arrest” (p. 124): arrests for robbery and burglary were reduced significantly. “The program accomplished these reductions by providing income that would not otherwise be available through legitimate channels” (p. 124).  The results support a harm reduction approach that gauges success beyond simple abstinence from all drugs. “Supported employment programs for heavy substance users represent a promising model for reducing predatory crimes such as robbery or burglary” (p. 125)., Reference: Uggen, Christopher and Sarah K.

Being stopped by the police increases future offending.,", There is a growing body of research suggesting that being processed by the criminal justice system can increase subsequent offending (see The Effects of Imprisonment: Specific Deterrence and Collateral Effects, Research Summaries Compiled from Criminological Highlights on our website) This study compares the impact on subsequent offending of being stopped by the police, or being stopped and arrested., The concern, derived from labeling theory is that “a public label may lead to secondary deviance… through social exclusion and the weakening of social bonds” (p. 930), and “once the deviant label is applied and the process of social exclusion is set in motion, the labeled individual may begin to develop or adopt a deviant identity” (p. 931)., This study uses four waves of longitudinal data on 2,127 youths, collected in the context of a program evaluation, to evaluate the impact of police contact.  Youths were interviewed each year for four years.  Their propensity to offend was estimated on the basis of the first years’ data. Police contact was assessed during the next two years and in the fourth interview, delinquency – the outcome variable - was measured.   The number of stops for questioning was obtained from each youth as was the number of arrests., In the third wave of data, school commitment was assessed as was youths’ involvement with  delinquent and non-delinquent peers. To assess ‘deviant identity’ youths were asked questions such as how guilty they would feel if they engaged in a range of different types of offences.  On the basis of their contact with the police, youths were divided into three groups: those with no contact with the police, those stopped (only) by the police, and those stopped and arrested.  Then, on the basis of their answers to questions during the first wave of data collection (when they were 11-12 years old) they were matched on their apparent propensity to be stopped and/or arrested by the police.  Though sets of youths with the same propensity to be stopped/arrested were created, only some were, in fact stopped or arrested by the police. It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that the police contact was, in a sense, randomly determined since the members of the three groups were matched with those in other groups who had the same ‘propensity’ to do whatever it was that would bring them into contact with the police., The results showed that after matching youths on their propensities to experience police contact, those who were arrested were significantly more likely to engage in delinquencies than those who were only stopped, and those stopped were more likely to engage in delinquencies than those who had no police contact.   Furthermore, there was a tendency for more police contact to reduce commitment to school, increase the likelihood that the youth would have delinquent friends, and reduce their feelings of guilt about offending., Other analyses suggest that the impact of being stopped by the police on offending is caused, in part, by increased likelihood that the youth will have larger numbers of delinquent friends.  But in addition, being arrested appears to increase delinquency through its effect on reducing commitment to school, reducing anticipated guilt about engaging in delinquency, and increasing the youth’s belief that offending really does not hurt anyone., Conclusion: Stop-and-frisk interactions between youths and police “may have the unintended consequence of increasing future delinquent involvement. Thus police practices of engaging in high rates of stops, many of which are ‘unproductive’ or ‘innocent,’ may be counterproductive” (p. 956).   “For both youth who are stopped and youth who are arrested, delinquency amplification is partially explained by the attenuation of prosocial bonds, changes in deviant identity, and increased involvement with delinquent peers” (p. 956-7)., Reference: Wiley, Stephanie Ann, Lee Ann Slocum, and Finn-Aage Esbensen (2013).  The Unintended Consequences of Being Stopped or Arrested: An Exploration of the Labeling Mechanisms Through Which Police Contact Leads to Subsequent Delinquency.

Americans who are most likely to favour highly punitive measures for young people who commit crime also are likely to hold strong anti-Black attitudes and to be members of the Tea Party Movement.,", In the US, there are contradictory explanations of the strong anti-Obama views of members of the American “Tea Party Movement” (TPM).  TPM supporters suggest that their complaint about government is not related to race (or the fact that the US president is Black), but instead reflects their opposition to the size of the US government and its specific policies (e.g., the government’s support for publicly funded health care).  On the other hand, racial threat theorists suggest that the TPM is driven largely by race issues., Other research has suggested that those who view crime as being disproportionately committed by Blacks are likely to be more punitive (see Criminological Highlights 1(1)#7, 10(3)#5, 13(1)#4).   This paper examines the relationship of support for the TPM and racial resentment (the view that Black Americans are currently treated more favourably than they deserve) to the view that the US should “get tough” in its youth justice policies., A representative sample of 961 adult Americans were interviewed on the telephone during the summer of 2010.  They were asked to indicate their support for various youth justice policies such as “Trying more juvenile offenders in adult court”, “Locking up more juvenile offenders”, and “Putting violent juvenile offenders in adult prisons” (p. 174).  Racial resentment was measured by the level of agreement with statements such as “It’s really a matter of some people not trying hard enough; if Blacks would only try harder they could be just as well off as whites” or “Irish, Italians, Jewish and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up.  Blacks should do the same without any special favours” (p. 176). Respondents were also asked if they consider themselves to be members of the TPM. In addition, data on various other control measures including income, gender, political ideology, perceived risk of being a victim of crime, and TV viewing were obtained., Not surprisingly, people who identified themselves as being conservative, those who said they  were at risk from crime, those who watched a lot of local news on TV, and those who did not think that offenders could be rehabilitated were more likely to favour punitive youth policies. On the other hand, older respondents, those with high levels of education and crime victims were less likely to favour punitive policies., However, above and beyond those effects, those harbouring strong feelings of racial resentment towards blacks and those who considered themselves to be tea party members were more likely to support harsh youth justice penalties.  Part – but not all - of the relationship between TPM membership and support for harsh youth justice policies appears to be mediated by racial resentment., Conclusion: “Prior research demonstrates the widespread typification of crime, especially youth crime, as a black phenomenon…. Thus the results in this study provide support for group threat theory by demonstrating that favourable attitudes to coercive crime control policies, which scholars have long suggested ‘provide white Americans with a means to control or subordinate black people’ … are greater among Tea Partiers – individuals who hold especially negative views about blacks and who are presumably the most anxious about the Obama presidency” (p. 183).   But in addition to Tea Party membership, those respondents who expressed resentment about favourable treatment of Black Americans were especially likely to express punitive attitudes towards youth who offend., Reference: Pickett, Justin T., Daniel Tope, and Rose Bellandi (2014). “Taking Back Our Country”: Tea Party Membership and Support for Punitive Crime Control Policies.

Neighbourhoods are most likely to be safe if very few or almost all streets in the neighbourhood are active and have people on them. The most dangerous neighbourhoods appear to be those that have a mixture of some active streets and some largely empty streets.,", Jane Jacobs suggested in 1961 that neighbourhoods with active street life were safer than quieter streets in part because there were always people around to ensure that crime did not occur. The assumption, of course, is that people will intervene if there is trouble and that the presence of others will deter those who, otherwise, might commit street crime.  Hence neighbourhoods composed of streets with many adults on them should be safe., From a neighbourhood perspective, however, if almost all of the activity is concentrated on a few streets, leaving the others empty, adding more ‘active’ streets may simply add more potential victims., Using data from a large Chicago study, 157 neighbourhoods were examined. Children and their parents were interviewed.  In addition,  all of the streets in each neighbourhood were observed to determine whether adults generally were present on the street. The neighbourhoods themselves were also assessed (using census data as well as crime and survey data) on various characteristics such as the level of poverty, people’s connection to the neighbourhood and their trust of others in the neighbourhood, whether people reported that they tended to know their neighbours, crime rates, etc.  The main outcome measures were whether neighbourhood residents reported that they had witnessed violence in the previous year, whether they or a family member had been a victim of violence, and the neighbourhood homicide rate., Exposure to violence was, in general, highest among African Americans and Latinos, males, youths without much family supervision and those living in poor neighbourhoods.  The most relevant finding, however, was that there was a curvilinear relationship between the level of street activity and the experience of violence.  Holding individual and other neighbourhood characteristics constant, in neighbourhoods in which most streets did not have any adults on them, there was apparently very little experience of violence (or victimization). As the proportion of streets with adults on them in the neighbourhood increased, the likelihood that residents would witness violence also increased.   However, at about the point at which about half of the blocks had at least one adult on them, increasing the prevalence of adults on the street tended to decrease residents’ exposure to violence. The findings were very similar for the measures of violent victimization and homicide., Conclusion: It would appear that when neighbourhood streets are mostly empty, “increases in the prevalence of active streets may offer little more than additional potential targets for victimization” (p. 1035). However, once a threshold is reached, increases in street use in a neighbourhood reduces exposure to violence, violent victimization, and homicide rates.  Hence it is possible that the ‘gentrification’ of neighbourhoods may produce short term increases in violence due to there being fewer people on the streets. The increase in violence will continue until the neighbourhood experiences higher rates of street use at which point it, the streets do, in fact, become safe., Reference: Browning, Christopher R. and Aubrey L. Jackson (2013).  The Social Ecology of Public Space: Active Streets and Violent Crime in Urban Neighbourhoods.  Criminology, 51 (4), 1009-1043, Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV14N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-14-no-4-%E2%80%93-august-2014,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 14, No. 4 – August 2014",Regular Issue,2014
"The outcome of a murder case is determined, in part, by the characteristics of the community in which it occurred.",", It is easily understood that certain characteristics of criminal cases (e.g., whether the defendant has a criminal record, or whether the defendant is tried by a jury) are likely to affect the outcome of jury trials.  It is less obvious, however, that characteristics of the community in which the offence takes place – e.g., how fearful people are, how cohesive the community is – might also affect case outcomes., This study examines the outcomes of the murder cases involving 2,518 suspects arrested for murder in 27 counties in the United States in 1988. Three outcomes were examined: whether the suspect was prosecuted (in 15% of cases, there was no prosecution), whether a jury convicted (85% of cases), and the mean sentence length for those convicted.   The effects of various case characteristics were examined (e.g., whether there were multiple victims, whether the murder took place in the victim’s home, whether the accused was arrested quickly), as were characteristics of the victim and defendant (race, age, sex, prior conviction, whether the accused was a drug dealer or gang member)., By using data from prosecutors’ case files as well as survey data in each jurisdiction (in order to be able to characterize the community), it was possible to see whether community characteristics had an impact on case outcome above and beyond the characteristics of the case. Hence various characteristics of the community were examined – e.g., the level of support for capital punishment in the community, level of fear of crime in the community,  and residents’ attachment to the community (an index which includes measures of trust of others in the community, involvement in community groups,  and belief that community residents will help them if needed)., Not surprisingly, trials were most likely to occur when arrests had been made quickly and when the murder took place in the victim’s home, as well as in those cases in which the offender was male, young and had prior convictions.  But overall, although case characteristics account for some of the variation in the disposition of cases within county, differences in case characteristics do not account for differences across counties on whether charges were laid and convictions obtained.  Not surprisingly, given that there are differences across states in the prescribed penalty for murder, case characteristics were more important in determining sentence length across counties., More interesting is the fact that characteristics of the counties predicted the outcome of cases. In fact, full prosecutions are more likely to take place in counties in which people are most supportive of capital punishment.  Contrary to expectations, however, people who were arrested for murder in counties in which people describe themselves as politically conservative were less likely to be sent to trial than were suspects in less conservative counties.   Convictions by a jury were most likely to occur in counties with high levels of religious fundamentalism and in counties with high support for capital punishment.  Sentences for murderers tended to be longer in counties with high levels of religious fundamentalism and fear.  But in addition, sentences were longer in counties in which people were more attached to their communities. This suggests that there may be heightened sensitivity to murder in communities with high levels of trust and cooperation., Conclusion: The legal outcome of homicide cases is, to some extent, determined by the level of community social organization and collective values in that community.  But the results are not simple: high levels of  support for capital punishment in a community were associated with increased likelihood of prosecution and conviction but not with harsher sentences. A high level of Christian fundamentalism in a community was associated with a high likelihood of conviction and longer sentences. Most importantly, however, it appears that “legal outcomes in criminal cases are influenced by several features of the social environments in which cases are processed” (p. 173)., Reference: Baumer, Eric P. and Kimberly H.

Arresting gang leaders can increase violent crime.,"Intervening in the activities of gangs can have adverse effects.  For example, research has suggested that interventions can increase gang cohesiveness and strain police-community relations.  Given that police sometimes ‘target’ gang leaders, it is important to understand the impact of decisions by the police to arrest gang leaders., This study examines the impact on gang activity of police crackdowns on gang leaders.  Most importantly, it suggests – and demonstrates – the importance of a gang’s ‘embeddedness’ within larger networks, community structures, and other criminal groups.  “Paying attention to criminal group embeddedness when evaluating gang interventions can help uncover unintended consequences because an intervention targeting one gang may have implications for the targeted gang’s competitors and allies” (p. 147).  More generally, this framework suggests that arrests of gang leaders can have different effects, depending on the nature of the gang., This study examines the impact of the arrests of the highest ranking group leaders in two gangs in a Chicago neighbourhood. One gang, the Latin Kings, had a more corporate leadership structure; the other, 22 Boys, exhibited charismatic leadership.  The leader of the Latin Kings answered to the gang’s national leader who operated out of a federal prison. He relied on a ‘corporate structure’ and insulated himself from carrying out any violence.  In fact, his name was not known either to community or to gang members.  In contrast, the leader of the 22 Boys gang (with an estimated membership of about 150 people) knew everyone and was seen, locally, as a fixer of local problems.  He was well known for protecting residents and gang members.  Each gang leader was arrested by the Chicago police and denied bail., Two types of data were examined.  First, residents were asked whether rates of violence in their neighbourhoods had changed over time. This question was asked without making reference to the arrest of the gang member. Second, monthly violent crime rates in the two gang territories where the leaders were arrested were examined. These were compared to violence rates in seven ‘control’ areas containing Latino gangs whose leaders were not subject to police intervention (the arrest of the gang leader). The main focus of the analysis was the level of violent crime in the gang territories in each of the 6 months following the gang leader’s arrest (compared to any changes in the ‘control’ areas)., In the Latin Kings’ territory (and in fact in adjacent territories) the quantitative data showed that the arrest of the ‘corporate’ style leader had no effect on violent crime. In contrast, the arrest of the 22 Boys’ charismatic leader was followed by an immediate and statistically significant spike in violence in the month after the arrest, and then a reduction to pre-existing levels. Residents’ reports as well as police and court documents “confirmed that the [22 Boys] gang leader’s arrest sparked an unprecedented level of violent aggression between rival adjacent gangs attempting to occupy 22 Boys territory” (p. 157). The Latin Kings’ prison leadership simply appointed a new leader.  Unlike the Latin Kings, the 22 Boys gang had no way to replace their charismatic leader., Conclusion:  The arrest of the two gang leaders had no impact on long-term rates of violent crime, but in the area occupied by the less ‘corporate’ gang, it created a one month spike in violent crime related to the establishment of control over the leaderless gang’s former territory. There was no effect on violent crime of the arrest of the more ‘corporate’ gang leader.  “Law enforcement may play an important role in the social structure of gang violence through interventions targeting gang leadership that may trigger episodes of retaliatory violence by disrupting a neighbourhood’s social order” (p. 162). Or, the arrest of the gang leader can have no effect.  It depends on the structure of the gang., Reference: Vargas, Robert (2014).  Criminal Group Embeddedness and the Adverse Effects of Arresting a Gang’s Leader: A Comparative Case Study.

"Unproductive police stops of ordinary citizens leads to political alienation, distrust and, more generally, civic disengagement for people living in areas targeted by the police.",", In some cities, the police have stepped up their stop-and-frisk activities.  New York City, for example, increased the number of such stops from about 90,000 in 2002 to 700,000 in 2011; nonetheless, the proportion of stops leading to arrest was essentially unchanged at about 5-6%.   One problem with large numbers of police stops is that these can be seen as a form of public shaming of those stopped, suggesting disrespect or unneeded harassment by the police., Previous research has found that “police-initiated contacts are strongly and negatively related to the probability that an individual will later call the police in times of need” (p. 205-6).  More generally, it seems that contact with the criminal justice system reduces civic engagement (Criminological Highlights 14(4)#1).  It appears, then, that police interactions with citizens “shape how communities interact with the state more broadly” (p. 206).  Police stops can range from those in which citizens only identify themselves to stops that lead to arrest, summons, etc.  In this paper, stops were labeled “surplus” if they involved a frisk, search, or use of force but did not result in an arrest, summons, or finding of contraband. From the perspective of the target of the stop as well as those who observed or heard about it, the stop was likely to be seen as gratuitous., In this paper, the researchers used as an indicator of civic engagement the rate of citizen calls to their municipal governments regarding their needs, concerns, and demands of the local government. These calls may involve broken streetlights, graffiti, complaints about city services, or other concerns. Calls to local government can be seen as “a way of connecting citizens to their municipal government… and fostering citizens’ confidence in the public sector” (p. 207). “By voicing their complaints, however mundane, citizens interact with government at the local level and obtain a response” (p. 208).  Alternatively, people in communities who do not use this service may have disengaged from and lost trust in their civic communities. In other words, they would see their city as not having an interest in their concerns., For this study, New York City was divided into small neighbourhood groupings (or blocks) involving about 1000 residents each.  Data – on 311 calls to municipal governments and police stops – were examined during a 24 month period.  In New York City, there are on average about 224 calls per 100 residents per year. The “stop rate”, the proportion of stops that were ‘surplus’, and the number of 311 calls all varied considerably across blocks., After controlling for measures of disadvantage in the neighbourhood, high rates of ‘surplus’ stops were associated with lower rates of 311 calls (overall, and calls concerning crime and safety). In another analysis, adjacent neighbourhoods that were in different police precincts and had very different rates of surplus stops were compared.  Again, those living in areas with high rates of surplus stops were less likely to make 311 calls., Conclusion: The results demonstrate that “when police search a higher number of citizens or deploy more force in their stops of community members, people become much less likely to make claims on local government” (p. 217).  The results were, however, different for the density of stops that did not involve ‘surplus’ force, suggesting that it is the “quality of policing, not merely the quantity” (p. 217) that makes the difference., Reference: Lerman, Amy E. and Vesla Weaver (2014).  Staying out of Sight?

Focusing police patrols on high crime areas can reduce the incidence of some types of crimes if the police do more than merely increase the frequency of their patrols.,", Recent research has suggested that high density police patrols targeting high crime areas (hot spots) can reduce crime, at least temporarily (Criminological Highlights 12(3)#3, 13(3)#2).  However, little is known about what kinds of activities by police are necessary to have any impact., This paper reports the results of an experiment in which small geographic areas (an average of 8 one-block segments with an average of 128 residents per area) in St. Louis, Missouri, were randomly assigned to one of three conditions.  For the ‘control’ areas, policing was carried out in the manner in which it normally had been.  In the ‘high density only’ areas, police spent a disproportionate amount of their time in these areas, but did nothing unusual while there.  In the ‘enhanced high density’ patrol areas, police not only spent a disproportionate amount of time in the area, but also engaged in self-initiated activities while there. These activities included arrests, pedestrian checks, building checks, occupied and unoccupied vehicle checks, foot patrols, and problem solving.  The special patrols took place over a 9 month period daily between 3 p.m. and 7 a.m. The goal was to reduce certain firearms violence (non-domestic firearms assaults and firearms robberies)., The importance of having a control group was demonstrated by the fact that there was a substantial reduction in firearms crime in the control areas (in which policing style and patrol density had not changed) during the 9-month period in which the study was carried out. In the ‘high density only’ patrol areas, the reduction in firearms violence was not significantly different from the reduction that took place in the control areas.  However, in the ‘enhanced high density’ patrol areas, there was a significantly larger reduction in firearms violence than in the control areas.  This was a result, completely, of the effect of the ‘enhanced high density’ patrols on non-domestic firearms assaults.  For reasons that are not at all clear, there was no effect of increased police patrols (enhanced or not) on firearms robberies., The effectiveness of the ‘enhanced high density’ patrols appears to be linked to two self-initiated activities by the police: arrest and checks on occupied vehicles. The other police-initiated activities appeared to be unrelated to drops in non-domestic firearms assaults.  There did not appear to be displacement of crime into adjacent areas, or other time periods, or to other (e.g., non-firearms) offences.  In other words, these police activities did not ‘push’ the crime to other times or locations., Conclusion:  The study demonstrates that high density police patrols, combined with certain police-initiated activities, can reduce certain firearms crimes. The fact that the reduction in crime was limited to firearms assaults and not firearms robberies is puzzling. “Certainty of arrests and occupied vehicle checks (but none of the other enforcement activities [that were] examined, were associated with reductions in nondomestic firearms assaults” (p. 446) during the period when the high intensity patrols were taking place.  The study also underlines the importance of having a control group. Because there was a control group, it was possible to see that the size of the crime reduction in high intensity patrol areas that did not have enhanced police-initiated activities was not significantly greater than the reduction that occurred ‘naturally’ in the control areas. Crime rates are not consistent over time making ‘no treatment’ control groups crucial if one wants to determine whether an innovation has an impact., Reference:  Rosenfeld, Richard, Michael J.

"The police practice of “Stop, question, and frisk” appears to be an ineffective way to reduce street crime.",", Stop, question, and frisk (SQF) approaches to policing urban areas have often been criticized because they target innocent people and are sometimes used in a racially biased fashion. In New York City, the documented number of police stops increased dramatically in the first decade of this century. In 2010, there were about 26 stops of Black people per 100 Black residents compared to about 3 stops of White people per 100 White residents.  Because crime dropped between 2000 and 2010, it is sometimes suggested that SQF approaches were responsible for this decrease.  Between 2003 and 2010 about 6.6% of stops in New York City resulted in arrest., This study examines the impact of police stops on rates of robbery and burglary in 75 New York City precincts between 2003 and 2010.  The annual rate of police stops varied from 33 to 4,381 stops per 10,000 people in the general population.   Various controls were used in multivariate analyses including neighbourhood disadvantage, neighbourhood stability, the percent Black in the neighbourhood, as well as the overall trend in crime rates.  In addition, the analyses were carried out examining the impact of police stops on crime in the current year as well as the impact of stops in each of the two previous years.  The research question was straightforward: Do SQF activities in a given year reduce crime in that year and/or the two following years?, There was a small, but somewhat inconsistent effect of police stops on robbery rates in the precinct.  Depending on the specific analysis, larger numbers of police stops in the current year or in the year before were associated with a decrease or an increase in robbery rates.  The results for burglary suggest that police stops were not associated with a reduction in this form of crime.  These same analyses were repeated to determine if there was a consistent effect of SQF arrests (the percent of SQF events leading to arrest and the SQF arrest rate).  There were no effects. When the effect of misdemeanour arrests were examined, it was again found that there were no consistent effects on the robbery or burglary rates when full controls were included (a finding similar to previous research: see Criminological Highlights 8(4)#1, 8(5)#8)., Conclusion:  The results “show few significant effects of several ‘stop, question and frisk’ (SQF) measures on precinct robbery and burglary rates” (p. 116) and those results that are significant do not hold across crimes or type of analyses. A cautious conclusion might be that one “cannot conclude from the current investigation that SQF has no impact on crime in New York.  But we can be more certain that, if there is an impact, it is so localized and dissipates so rapidly that it fails to register in annual precinct crime rates, much less the decade-long citywide crime reductions that public officials have attributed to the policy.  If SQF is effective, but its effects are highly focused and fleeting, policy-makers must decide whether expansions in a policy that already produces nearly 700,000 police stops a year are warranted, especially given the ongoing controversy regarding the disproportionate impact of SQF on racial and ethnic minorities and the possibility that it reduces police legitimacy, which may erode its crime-reduction effects over the long term” (p. 117-118)., Reference:  Rosenfeld, Richard and Robert Fornango (2012).  The Impact of Police Stops on Precinct Robbery and Burglary Rates in New York City, 2003-2010.  Justice Quarterly, 37(1), 96-122., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV14N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-14-no-5-%E2%80%93-november-2014,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 14, No. 5 – November 2014",Regular Issue,2014
"Race and crime are intimately linked in the US: White and Black Americans explain crime in different ways, favour different policies, and experience crime in quite different ways.",", Explanations of the popularity of punitive crime policies in the US without taking into account issues related to race are almost certain to be inadequate.  Black and White Americans view crime differently.  Understanding the differences in the perceptions of these two groups is important if one wants to understand levels of support for various policies related to crime., White Americans are more likely than Black Americans to believe that “people commit crime because they don’t care about the rights of others or their responsibilities to society” (p. 31). Black Americans are more likely to explain crime by reference to social or structural factors (e.g., disadvantage).  Not surprisingly, therefore, Whites are more likely than Blacks to support capital punishment, three strikes laws, and trying juveniles as adults.  More generally, Whites are more likely than Blacks to believe that sentences are not harsh enough., Blacks, on the other hand, are more likely than Whites to be victims of crime.  For example, they are considerably more likely than Whites to experience household burglary and motor vehicle theft, sexual and non-sexual assaults and robberies. The rate of homicide victimization for Blacks is 6.2 times higher than the rate for Whites, a difference that has existed for more than 30 years. Not surprisingly, therefore, people of colour are considerably more likely to report that they avoid certain areas in their neighbourhoods because of crime and that they would be afraid if they did have to venture into these areas., There are data suggesting that the decisions by the police about which crimes to target disadvantage Black Americans.  For example, one study found that Blacks, compared to Whites, were 1.3 times more likely to report using marijuana in the month prior to being interviewed, but were 3.7 times more likely to have been arrested for marijuana possession. Not surprisingly, over the past 20 years, Blacks are considerably more likely than Whites to believe that the American justice system is biased against Black people.  This difference does not disappear when social class is controlled for. “In fact, highly educated Blacks and Whites are more sceptical of the criminal justice system than their less-educated counterparts” (p. 33).  Even simple ‘factual’ information about crime can have surprising effects. One study showed that people who were given information about the over-representation of Blacks among those who are executed were more likely to support the death penalty for murder than those who did not receive this information., Although White Americans are much more likely to suggest that the best way to reduce crime is to invest in police and prisons (10% of Whites endorsed this view compared to only 1% of Blacks), large numbers of both Whites and Blacks did suggest that investment in education and job training would be the most effective way (Whites: 35%; Blacks 58%).  More Whites than Blacks (45% vs. 35%) thought that equal investments should be made for both approaches.  A small number of each group did not like either approach., Conclusion: Blacks’ and Whites’ experiences with victimization and the criminal justice system are different.  Their perceptions of the system reflect, to some extent, these differences.  Given that Whites and Blacks have different implicit ‘theories’ of the causes of crime, it is not surprising that they come to different conclusions about how best to deal with crime., Reference: Ghandnoosh, Nazgol (2014).

Public safety is not compromised by retroactively shortening sentences.,", From time to time, people are released from prison sooner than was originally expected.  In France, for example, groups of prisoners are released from time to time before their normal release dates (often on a national holiday prisoners are released simply to keep prison numbers in check). On occasion, prisoners also have been given the opportunity to petition for sentence reductions. For example, when the United States Sentencing Commission amended the guideline for offences involving crack cocaine in 2007, the Commission allowed judges to hear motions from existing prisoners, who had already been sentenced,  for a retroactive reduction in the sentences they were serving., This study examines a simple question: Were those who received an unexpected benefit – early, and unexpected,  release from prison – more likely to reoffend than those who served their full sentence.  Said differently, did the decision to allow these prisoners to return to the community earlier than expected put the community at risk?  Within about 40 months of the decision allowing the courts to give existing prisoners the benefit of the reduced guideline sentence, 25,736 prisoners had applied to have their sentences shortened. Most of these applications (64%) were granted.  Most of those prisoners whose motions for a sentence reduction were denied were not legally eligible for a sentence reduction., Those whose motions for a reduced sentence were successful had their sentences reduced by an average of 30 months (from an average of 12 years, 9 months to 10 years 3 months).  Federal prisoners normally serve 85% of their sentences.  A sample of 836 prisoners released in 2008 after serving sentences related to crack cocaine offences were matched with 483 similar crack cocaine prisoners who served their full sentences but were released in the 12 months immediately before the change came into effect. Both groups were largely male (91%) and Black (87% and 86% for the ‘early’ and ‘regular’ release groups, respectively) and similar in age (36.3 years and 35.4 years).  They had similar criminal history scores and similar proportions had been sentenced below the guideline (31%, 33%) on a motion by the prosecutor. Most had been sentenced during a time when the ‘guidelines’ were mandatory., The recidivism rates (defined as a re-arrest or revocation of supervised release) were similar for the two groups at all points in time up to the end of the 5-year follow-up period. At the end of 2 years, the recidivism rate for the ‘early release’ group was 30.4%; this was not significantly different from the rate for the comparison group (32.6%).  Those with longer criminal histories tended to have higher recidivism rates, but there were no significant differences between the ‘early release’ and ‘full sentence’ prisoners at any level of criminal history.  Five years after release, 43.3% of the early release prisoners had been re-arrested or revoked.  This was not significantly different from the comparison group figure (47.8%).  Looking only at re-arrest, the groups were similar (33.9% and 37.3% for the early release and full release groups, respectively)., Though the two groups were similar on all measured dimensions, it is possible that the groups were different on other characteristics. In addition, it is possible that, for other reasons, social conditions in the community were different for those released between July and November 2008 than for the comparison group (released March 2007-February 2008). This seems implausible, however, when one considers that for most of the 5-year follow-up, the “at risk” periods overlapped., Conclusion: It would appear that an unexpected reduction of over 2 years in prison for these cocaine offenders did not encourage them to re-offend.  Various analyses suggest that the re-offending rates for various subgroups of these offenders did not differ significantly from the re-offending rates for those who served the sentences they expected when they were first sentenced.  For these drug offenders, then, unexpected early release did not lead to changes in offending rates., Reference: Hunt, Kim Steven and Andrew Peterson (2014) Recidivism Among Offenders Receiving Retroactive Sentence Reductions: The 2007 Crack Cocaine Amendment.

"For people with serious criminal records, getting a job is more likely to be a sign that they have stopped offending than it is to be a cause of their decision to stop offending.",", The link between unemployment and offending has received a good deal of attention.  The idea that ‘getting a job’ leads some people not to offend has received some support (see Criminological Highlights 3(4)#2, 4(3)#6), 6(4)#5, 8(6)#4, 10(2)#3, 13(3)#5, 14(2)#7).  The alternative hypothesis – that being employed or successfully completing job programs may signal an end to offending and is not, therefore, a ‘cause’ of the cessation of offending – has also received some support (Criminological Highlights 12(4)#8).  It may be that those looking for change in their lives may stop offending first and eventually get a job.  Alternatively, a job may be a ‘hook for change’ which, for those who have decided to change, “has the potential to sustain and reinforce the emerging process of desistance [from crime]” (p. 264)., This paper examines the employment careers and reoffending rates of 783 Norwegian serious male offenders. Each had committed at least five felonies between 1992 and 2000, at least one of which occurred after 1998.  In addition, each was unemployed or had only a marginal employment history between 1998 and 2000.  Between 2001 and 2007 everyone in this sample got jobs lasting at least 6 months.  A comparison group was constructed of offenders who were similar up until 2000, but who did not enter into stable employment in 2001 or thereafter., Data on employment (and income) were obtained from the national employment registry and from the national tax authorities.  Offending was defined as having committed at least one felony that resulted in a criminal justice sanction in a given month.   Using these data, offending for individuals could be measured for up to 36 months before and after the transition to employment.  In addition, offending rates could be compared to offending rates in the group that did not enter stable employment during this period., In the three year period before the men got stable employment, offending rates decreased quite dramatically up to the point when the men got stable employment.  For those whose employment continued for at least 36 months, this relatively low offending rate was maintained.  The fact that offending rates did not decrease after the men got jobs suggests that employment did not cause the decrease in offending. The comparison group – men who never achieved stable employment--maintained a high and fairly constant rate of offending throughout the period.   These data would suggest, then, that decreased offending followed decisions made by these men to change their lives or changes which occurred to them prior to getting jobs., For those who lost their job after having one for at least 6 months, there was a significant ‘rebound’ in offending. It is difficult to know whether this increase in offending occurred because the men’s offending caused them to lose their jobs, or because those who lost their jobs were different in some other way from those who maintained their jobs., Conclusion: It appears that for serious offenders, a period of criminal inactivity precedes getting stable employment – a decrease that does not occur for comparable people who do not, subsequently, find employment. Hence it appears that “a significant reorientation in life priorities is a necessary precondition for voluntary job entry among men with an extensive history of criminal offending…. [The] results contradict the turning point hypothesis and [are consistent with] the maturation perspective and the hook-for-change hypothesis, both of which assume individual change prior to job entry” (p. 286)., Reference: Skardhamar, Torbjørn and Jukka Savolainen (2014).

"Residence restrictions placed on convicted sex offenders are shown, once again, to be ineffective.",", “Changes in the philosophies of the criminal justice system have virtually separated the sexual offender from every other type of criminal” (p. 155).   Even though they have recidivism rates as low as or lower than most other offenders, many jurisdictions have special laws ostensibly designed to protect society from sex offenders.  Many of these – residence restrictions, registries, notification systems, etc. – seem to be designed for a small subset of all sex offenders – predatory strangers.  Existing data suggest that these approaches do nothing to protect society (see the Criminological Highlights collection on sex offenders, Some Recent Research on Sex Offenders and Society’s Responses to Them)., This study was designed to examine the efficacy of residential restrictions in two US states, Missouri and Michigan, that in 2006 prohibited convicted sex offenders from living, working, or loitering near schools, playgrounds, etc.  By tracking sex offenders released from prison before and after the residency restrictions became law, it was possible to evaluate whether the restrictions changed where sex offenders lived and whether they changed sex offenders’ re-offending rates., Before-after changes in residence locations and re-offending rates were examined not only for sex offenders in these states but also for non-sex offenders in order to determine whether any changes that might be discovered could be explained by broader changes taking place in these two states., The enforcement of residence requirements is not straightforward since determining the locations of all facilities that trigger restrictions may not be easy (e.g., daycares may change locations).  Furthermore, some sex offenders’ registered addresses may have been ‘close’ to a restricted location, but an exception may have applied (e.g., living in transitional housing).   Nevertheless, the comparison of the residential addresses of 1200 released sex offenders with restrictions on where they could live with the residential locations of 2125 sex offenders released before the imposition of residential restrictions showed no significant difference in the proportion of residents who lived close enough to one of a location like a school that was prohibited by the new law.  In Michigan 22% of the released sex offenders were found to be living in areas in which they were apparently prohibited to live; in Missouri the comparable figure was 21%., Residential restrictions also did not appear to reduce reoffending by the sex offenders. In Michigan, after controlling for various known predictors of recidivism (e.g., age, prior convictions), there were comparable sized increases in reconvictions for both sexual offenders and non-sexual offenders.  In Missouri, there were significant decreases in the rate of technical violations of conditions of release for both sex offenders and non-sex offenders, but no changes in the reconviction rates. However, the sex offenders who had restrictions placed on them appeared to be crime-free for a somewhat longer period of time even though their overall rate of reconviction was the same., Conclusion: It would be difficult to conclude that sex offender residence restrictions are effective since they seem to have little impact on where people actually live. Furthermore, the impact of these restrictions on recidivism varies across measures (rate vs. timing of recidivism) as well as across the two states (Michigan vs. Missouri).  These 2-year recidivism rates used overall reoffending (sexual offences and non-sex offences) as the outcome measure for a simple reason: there were very few sexual offences by these offenders after release. The restrictions did not appear to affect this already low rate.  Another reason that one would not expect residence restrictions to affect reoffending is that residence restrictions relate to the presence of children and most of the sex offences in these two states (77% to 87%) did not involve children., Reference:  Huebner, Beth M. and five others (2014).  The Effect and Implications of Sex Offender Residence Restrictions: Evidence from a Two-State Evaluation.  Criminology & Public Policy, 13, 139-168., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV14N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-14-no-5-%E2%80%93-november-2014,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 14, No. 5 – November 2014",Regular Issue,2014
"If courts want youths on probation to complete non-custodial treatment programs, it would be helpful to ensure that the program was administered at a location close to the youth’s home.","Juvenile courts often spend considerable effort trying to determine which treatment programs are most appropriate for youths appearing before them.  Given that treatment programs are expensive and there are often more potential clients than there are spaces in the program, it is important to use these services wisely.  In the context of scarce program resources, it may be important to choose youths who are likely to attend the program as required., This paper looks at a simple, easily-available, predictor of successful completion of a program that can be easily determined by the court (or probation service) that is ordering the program – the distance that the youth must travel to attend the program. Other possible predictors of successful completion of programs – person variables such as race, offence history, or characteristics of the neighbourhood in which the youth lives – were also examined and used as control variables to see whether ‘distance to the treatment  from the youth’s home’ was a significant predictor of successful completion of the program above and beyond other traditional predictors of program completion., This study examined the predictors of program completion for 6208 youths in Philadelphia who had been assigned to attend one of 24 different treatment programs. Failures to complete an assigned program were divided into two types:  those youths who were expelled from the program for reasons such as being arrested or violating the rules of the program, and those youths who did not complete it because they didn’t attend the program as required. The main independent variable was simple: how far was the youth’s home from the location of the treatment facility.  In addition, factors such as the youth’s age, sex, race, prior offence history, and parents’ criminal history were used as control factors, as were various measures of neighbourhood disadvantage., On average, youths lived about 7 km from the treatment facility that they were expected to attend (range about 32 metres to about 33 km).   13% of the youths were expelled from the program they were enrolled in. There was no impact of the youth’s distance from the treatment program on whether or not the youth was expelled from a program.  However, when looking at the question of whether or not a youth dropped out, two independent program effects emerged: dropouts were more common among youths required to attend many hours per week.  In addition, youths were more likely to drop out of treatment if they lived further away from the treatment facility., Conclusion:  Previous work has found a relationship between the density of rehabilitative services in a community and the likelihood of successful reintegration of those released from prison on parole (Criminological Highlights V11N6#3).  It may well be that the importance of the density of services is that those parolees released into well serviced neighbourhoods don’t need to go far to receive services.  In this study, simply living close to the location of the rehabilitative program meant that the youth was more likely to complete the program. These findings suggest that those responsible for rehabilitative services should consider two things.  First, services should be located in close geographic proximity to the clients that the service is meant to serve.  Second, judges and probation officers who require youths to attend services should take into account the distance from the youth’s home and the service. Those assigning youths to rehabilitative services should be cautious in requiring youths to attend services that are distant from their homes., Reference: Lockwood, Brian (2012).  The Influence of Travel Distance on Treatment Noncompletion for Juvenile Offenders.

"When asked what purposes sentences should attempt to serve, ordinary citizens’ preferences depended on the age of the offender, the offence, and the criminal record of the offender.",", In many countries, including Canada, judges are offered a “pick-and-mix approach to sentencing purposes” (p. 291) where they are required to choose one or more purposes to guide – or justify – the sentence that they hand down.  The question raised by this study is whether such an approach is consistent with the public’s view of what sentencing should accomplish.  In particular, this study examines whether, for members of the public, the facts of the case determine which sentencing purposes they feel should be emphasized., A representative sample of 800 adult Australian residents (100 from each Australian state and territory) were read 8 short descriptions of cases (e.g., “A young 17 year old offender who has been convicted of burglary and has no previous criminal record”).  After each description, respondents were then asked “What do you think should be the most important purpose of sentencing?”  Five choices were offered including “Give them the punishment they deserve” and “Rehabilitate them” (p. 295). They were asked to choose the single most important purpose of sentencing.  The eight scenarios varied on 3 dimensions: offender age (a young offender vs. an adult); offence type (burglary vs. serious assault); and offence history (no previous record vs. three previous convictions)., Generally speaking, ordinary citizens were more likely to endorse rehabilitation as the primary purpose in sentencing youths than in sentencing adults.   Rehabilitation was seen to be much more appropriate as the guiding purpose of sentencing for both adults and youths with no criminal records than it was for those with three previous convictions.  And rehabilitation was more likely to be seen as the appropriate purpose for burglary than for a serious assault., Simply giving offenders the punishment they deserved, on the other hand, was more likely to be endorsed as the primary goal of sentencing when the offender – youth or adult – had a criminal record.  Generally speaking ‘punishment’ was more likely to be endorsed when the offender was an adult than a youth and when the offence was a serious assault than when it was a burglary., Incapacitation was very infrequently endorsed as the appropriate primary sentencing goal for those without a criminal record.  However, when the offender had a criminal record it was seen as the appropriate goal by about one third of the respondents in the case of the serious assault and about one fifth of the respondents in the case of burglary., Conclusion:  The results demonstrate that ordinary citizens “take into consideration offence type, offender age and offence history when determining the most appropriate purpose of sentencing” (p. 301).   It would appear, then,  that the public is more nuanced in its approach to the sentencing decision than is often presumed.  Findings such as those that suggest that the public views sentences as being too lenient need to be interpreted in the context of these findings that demonstrate quite clearly that, as with sentencing courts, members of the general public consider the specifics of each case as they weigh the importance of various sentencing purposes., Reference: Spiranovic, Caroline A., Lynne D.

Both women and men are more likely to reoffend if they are sent to prison than if they are made subject to some other less intrusive sanction.,", Previous research has shown that those given prison sentences are, if anything, more likely to reoffend than are equivalent people given non-prison sentences.  The failure of prison to reduce reoffending has been demonstrated both for adults (see Criminological Highlights 11(1)#1, 11(1)#2, 11(4)#2, 11(6)#4), 12(5)#8) and youths (Criminological Highlights, 10(6)#1, 12(1)#8, 12(5)#7).  This study expands our knowledge of the effect of imprisonment on reoffending by looking separately at the impact of prison sentences on the reoffending rates of women and men., Starting with a sample of 7550 women and ten thousand men who were released from Florida prisons between 1994 and 2002, offenders were, to the extent that it was possible, matched with those who received traditional probation, intensive probation, or a jail sentence (a custodial sentence of a year or less).   Matching was carried out separately for women and men. The matching was carried out by creating a score for each person on the likelihood of going to prison vs. each of the three other possible outcomes, separately (probation, intensive probation, and jail). The propensity scores were calculated from race (Black, Hispanic, White), age, type of offence, severity of offence, number and type of prior convictions, and whether they had been imprisoned before., In effect, this means that a single match was found for the imprisoned offenders first from those who got probation, and then for each of the other outcomes.  On the individual variables, the matched groups were almost identical.  The fact that matching was possible for so many offenders demonstrates that “similar sentences receive dissimilar treatment” (p. 376) reasonably often., The offenders were followed for three years following release from prison or jail, or 3 years after sentencing for those who received a non-custodial sentence., Four separate types of recidivism were examined: reconviction for a violent, property, drug, or other type of offence.  Recidivism rates were compared for imprisoned offenders against each of the three groups (separately) that received non-prison sanctions. These analyses were carried out separately for women and men.  For women, each of the comparisons involved at least 3934 matched pairs of offenders.  For men, all comparisons involved at least 8510 matched pairs. 22 of the 24 different comparisons (male/female by four type of recidivism by 3 different comparisons for imprisoned offenders) showed higher rates of recidivism for imprisoned inmates; 16 of them were significant.  Neither of the two comparisons showing lower reconviction rates for imprisoned offenders was significant., The size of the effects varied somewhat.  But what is important is that there was no evidence – for women or men – that imprisonment led to lower reconviction rates compared to equivalent other offenders who received, instead of imprisonment, probation, intensive probation, or a (shorter) jail sentence.  Indeed, the opposite occurred: in general, those receiving prison sentences tended to be more likely to reoffend during the three years following their release., Conclusion:  The results suggest that prison sentences, if anything, increase offending for both women and men.  The crime-increasing impact of imprisonment appeared to be greater when compared to two clearly non-custodial sentences – ordinary probation and intensive probation.   For women, a prison sentence appeared to be more likely to increase property offending rather than violent or drug offending,   People are sent to prison for lots of reasons.  These findings suggest that for both women and men, it is not the case that they will ‘learn a lesson’ and stop offending after being sent to prison. Rather, it seems more likely that the ‘lesson learned’ from prison is to commit more crimes., Reference:  Mears, Daniel P., Joshua C. Cochran, and William D. Bales (2012).

The arrest and prosecution of those arrested for marijuana possession does not appear to serve any useful public safety purpose.,", In 1977, the New York State legislature reclassified the private possession of small amounts of marijuana as a non-criminal offence, making it punishable at most by a $250 fine and 15 days in jail.  In doing so, the legislation explicitly found that “arrests, criminal prosecutions and criminal penalties are inappropriate for people who possess small amounts of marijuana for personal use” (p. 10). Nevertheless, “between 1996 and 2011, the New York City police made 586,320 arrests for possession of marijuana in public view” (p. 11).  Marijuana arrests in Canada, also, are not rare.  In 2011, Canadian police recorded 61,406 criminal incidents in which possession of cannabis was the most serious crime. In 28,183 of these incidents an adult or youth was charged., Arrests for minor crimes clearly can have long term consequences, including the acquiring of a police or criminal record.  Marijuana arrests are sometimes justified in terms of crime control.  However, previous research (Criminological Highlights, V8N5#8) has found that, when other relevant controls are included, arrests for use of marijuana in public view had no crime-reducing impact.  Nevertheless, more recently, “New York City officials have suggested that marijuana possession arrests promote public safety. They have never, however, articulated the precise way that they do so” (p. 14).  The police have suggested, simply, that “Taking care of little crimes, including pot possession… helped drive crime down” (p. 14).  One suggestion that has been made – without evidence – is that marijuana arrests help the police identify people who would be likely to have committed other offences or might, in the future, commit offences., This paper identified 29,147 people arrested for private possession of marijuana in 2003 and 2004 under the 1977 law. They were tracked from 2003/4 until June 2011. 49% were Black; 31% were Latino; 17% were White, and the remaining 3% were a mixture of groups.   About 33% were arrested for a felony one or more times during this 6.5-8.5 year follow-up period.  However, only 10% were convicted of any felony during this follow-up period and only 3.5% of the whole sample was convicted of a violent felony.   An additional 10.1% of the sample were convicted of one or more of a broad category of what might be called “injurious misdemeanors” (predominantly criminal trespass, impaired driving, minor assaults). Even though the original sample was identified because of involvement in drugs, 95% of the total sample were never, during this period, convicted of a felony drug offence., Conclusion:  “If the point of making massive marijuana arrests is to cast a wide net where potential sharks might be lurking [a justification offered by a former deputy police commissioner], the police seem to be pulling in far more dolphins than sharks.  Neither [these] findings nor those of other researchers indicate the arrests are an efficient or fair means for identifying future dangerous felons”  (p. 27).    Clearly the high rate of arrests of Blacks and Latinos “raise serious human rights concerns… even in the absence of racist intent” (p. 2).   But in addition, the financial costs of processing tens of thousands of marijuana arrests each year and the possibility that “goodwill toward law enforcement may be eroded when substantial numbers of community residents are arrested or witness friends and relatives arrested for marijuana possession…” (p. 3) have to be considered.  The fact that most of those arrested for private marijuana possession do not appear to be involved in anything serious thereafter raises further questions about the value of a policy that encourages these arrests., Reference: Human Rights Watch (November 2012).

Citizen satisfaction with the police is determined largely by how citizens are treated rather than by how successful the police are in locating or charging an offender.,", These days, the police, as with other public service agencies, are expected to do more with less. Some police managers have suggested that if fewer resources translates into a reduced ability to ‘get results’ (e.g., locate an offender) the public will lose confidence in the police.  The findings in this paper suggest that the police are more in control of how the public views them than they might have thought., Previous research (e.g., Criminological Highlights V8N2#1, V8N5#5) has suggested that the quality of the interaction between police officers and members of the public has an important effect on how the police are rated, but that this effect is asymmetric: Encounters in which citizens believe police have not shown them appropriate respect have a much larger impact than positive encounters., In one study, residents of 16 English neighbourhoods were interviewed in 2003/4 and again a year later. In citizen-initiated contacts that took place between the two interviews (in which citizens were victims of a crime or initiated contact with the police for any other reason), being satisfied with the interaction with the police had very little impact on whether citizens thought their local police were doing a good job.  Being dissatisfied with the interaction with the police, however, was a strong predictor of reduced ratings of the police., In a second study, using British Crime Survey data from 2008/9, victims whose victimizations came to the attention of the police were asked how satisfied they were with how the police handled their personal crime incident.  Respondents were asked about whether the police seemed to show interest in the victim’s incident and whether the offender was identified and charged. For property crimes, victims were also asked whether the police recovered the stolen property., “Respondents who felt that police did not show enough interest were much less likely to be satisfied… regardless of whether the offender had been identified and/or charged. Those who felt the police had shown enough interest, by contrast, were more likely to be satisfied… regardless of what had happened in relation to the offender” (p. 413).  Outcomes did matter, but the positive impact of the outcome was considerably less in cases where police seemed uninterested in the case compared to cases where citizens thought police showed appropriate interest. “If officers did not show enough interest, there was no significant difference in the probabilities of satisfaction predicted for cases where the offender was identified and charged and those cases where the offender was not identified at all. However, if officers did show enough interest, knowing that a charge had been brought appeared to boost the chance of being very satisfied…” (p. 413)., Conclusion: Obviously, victims do care about the outcome of their cases.  However, “a criminal justice outcome alone… appears less likely to result in overall satisfaction than good interpersonal treatment and a tailored response” (p. 416) on the part of the police.  Hence, police officers or police organizations that focus solely on “getting a result” (p. 417) run the risk of losing the support of the public they serve. A policing style oriented toward procedural justice is likely to have a positive impact on public satisfaction. “Policy makers and police managers might do well to emphasize the key role played by the public both in helping to detect crime and in cooperating with the police to build and maintain social order” (p. 419).   If the police find it is important to have public trust and cooperation to help them apprehend offenders, then the evidence would suggest that it would helpful for them to attend carefully to the nature of their interaction with victims and other citizens., Reference: Myhill, Andy and Ben Bradford (2012).

"Sex offending typically represents a transitory phase in an offender’s life, not a life-defining event.",", A number of criminal justice policies have special provisions for sex offenders. These include dangerous offender provisions, restrictions on the use of certain sanctions (e.g., conditional sentences of imprisonment in Canada), registries, notification requirements, and restrictions on the availability of pardons (in Canada). These policies seem to be based in part on the notion that once a person commits a sexual offence, he is very likely to commit more.  This assumption is challenged by a fair amount of research (see Criminological Highlights V5N1#4, V6N3#3, V6N6#8, V8N3#8, V9N2#5, V9N5#7, V11N4#7, V12N4#7)., Scales for the prediction of future offending have been shown to perform, statistically, better than chance, but have been criticized for being too inaccurate for individual decisions. Risk prediction in this field typically looks at static facts from the past (e.g., history of offending, age, type of offending).  However, they typically do not take into account different patterns of behaviour leading up to the offence.  Furthermore, they may not adequately capture one of the “most agreed upon clinical observations” (p. 536) about sex offenders: their heterogeneity., In this study, rather than considering ‘criminal history’ as a static risk factor, the trajectories of offending of 237 sex offenders over age 35 at the time of their release from a Canadian penitentiary were examined.  All had been sentenced to at least 2 years in prison.  The number and pattern of charges for violent and sexual offences from age 18 onwards were used to group these offenders. Trajectories of offending (for the period age 18-35) were created separately for violent and sexual offences and then for the two types of offences combined.  The vast majority of these offenders had committed very few offences., The trajectory modeling showed that for sexual offending, the data were best described by two groups: a group that showed an increasing rate of offending between age 18 to age 35 (4% of the total sample), and a group of very low rate offenders throughout this period of their lives (96% of the total sample).   Sexual offence recidivism was defined as a new charge for any sexual offence within an average 5-year follow-up period after the offender was released from penitentiary. (All offenders were at least 35 years old when released.) The recidivism rate was 6.1% for the low rate sex offenders (n=229) and 38% for that very small group of offenders (n=8) with a high and increasing rate of offending when they were younger.  The overall sexual offending recidivism rate for these 237 sex offenders released from a Canadian penitentiary was 7%.   The results were similar when the offenders were classified according to their pattern of charges for sexual and violent offences combined. This analysis found three distinct groups: very low rate, low rate, and high rate increasers.  Their overall sexual and violent recidivism rates were 8%, 24% and 38%, respectively. Overall sex or violent offending recidivism was 14%., Conclusion: The findings suggest that for these convicted sex offenders, “a sex crime might be best conceptualized as a transitory phase in the criminal career rather than evidence of a sexual criminal career in the making” (p. 553). However, there was, at the same time, “evidence suggesting the presence of a very small group of offenders following an active, high rate sexual offending pattern between age 18 and 35” (p. 554). For them, the recidivism rate was higher than the rate for those who had been low rate offenders between age 18-35.  But in addition, the recidivism data suggest that by the time this high rate group might be identified, “they might no longer constitute the most dangerous group of offenders” (p. 554).  The overall rates of recidivism of all identified groups in this sample suggest that even among those with the most problematic patterns of previous offending (e.g., increasingly high rate offending when 18-35) the 5-year recidivism rates, when released from penitentiary, are fairly low and the number of such offenders is very small., Reference: Lussier, Patrick and Garth Davies (2011).

Globalization of organized crime groups may involve more than simply opening up branch plants around the world.,", This paper explores, empirically, “whether organized crime groups are able to move abroad easily and reproduce their territorial control in a different country” (p. 235).  One hypothesis is that organized crime groups are like ordinary companies and simply open up branch plants to take advantage of local conditions. This hypothesis assumes that organized crime groups do essentially the same things in the new location as they did in the old.  The competing view is that mafias are local and stationary and that new territory presents mafia groups with difficult challenges because of the local environment.  In other words, the alternative view is that mafias engage in different behaviour in the new territory to which they move., The Solntsevskaya crime group, based in Moscow, has been described as Europe’s most powerful organized crime group in terms of wealth, influence, and financial control. As a result of struggles in Moscow related to leadership, some of the group’s leaders decided to move to Italy where they already had some contacts.   Police wiretaps of conversations involving 164 individuals connected to this group during a 3 year period (1995-7) were collected and transcribed. This paper is based, in large part, on these data., In Russia, the group was primarily involved in a protection racket. In addition, they were thought to control banks and other enterprises. In Italy, the situation was very different.  The money for the Italian operation came from Russia.  But the conversations captured by the wiretaps indicated that most of the activity in Italy focused on investment opportunities – largely import-export ventures involving everything from wheat and steel to Armani suits and works of art.   The group in Italy also spent a fair amount of time in such activities as opening bank accounts, getting Italian passports and drivers licenses, and acquiring citizenship.  Many of the wiretapped conversations, of course, involved Italians and were conducted entirely within Italy (i.e., did not directly involve Russia).   Other activities – which constituted only a small amount of their activities (about 7% of the conversations) – involved discussions about protection activities.  But none of these conversations involved protection activities in Italy.  Instead, they involved protection activities in Moscow, the ‘home base’ of the group in question., Women, in Italy, played a more important role and were involved in discussions within the group about internal discipline.  More generally, women in the Italian organization had more important roles than did women in Russia. Although women did not appear to be involved in the use of violence, they appeared to be involved in important activities including decisions about the appropriate types of punishment. One possible explanation for the increased importance of women in the new country (Italy) was that men whom the Russian mafia members were likely to feel they could trust were probably in short supply., Conclusion: In Italy, it would seem that the actual criminal activities of the Russian mafia were very different from what they had been in Russia.  The ‘core business’ of the group – the protection racket – did not move to Italy when the group expanded into that country.  The notion that “criminal groups globalize because they are searching for attractive labour or raw material markets is not confirmed by this case study” (p. 248-9).  The fact that mafia groups may change their activities when they expand has important implications for those trying to control them., Reference: Varese, Federico (2012).  How Mafias Take Advantage of Globalization: The Russian Mafia in Italy.  British Journal of Criminology, 52, 235-253., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV13N2.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-13-no-2-%E2%80%93-february-2013,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 13, No. 2 – February 2013",Regular Issue,2013
"When police officers stop cars for traffic violations, the likelihood that they will also conduct a search depends not only on the race of the driver and the race of the officer, but also the racial makeup of the neighbourhood in which the stop took place.",", Searches of ordinary citizens that take place when there is no evidence that a serious offence has taken place are among the most intrusive actions that police can take.  This paper examines a straightforward hypothesis: that the likelihood of a search of a driver stopped for a traffic violation depends on the race of both the citizen and the police officer as well as the racial makeup of the neighbourhood in which the traffic stop takes place., It is suggested that White officers, who may be seen in American society as higher status than Black police officers, will be more likely to search people they stop than will Black police officers.   Black citizens, who may be seen as lower status than White citizens, will be more likely to be searched.  The hypothesis, then, is that searches are most likely to take place when a White officer stops a Black citizen. Searches would be least likely to take place when a Black officer stops a White Citizen.  When the race of the officer and citizen is the same, the likelihood of a search should be between these two extremes, with White officers somewhat more likely to search White citizens than Black officers would be to search Black citizens., This paper examines records of ordinary traffic stops by police officers in St. Louis, Missouri. Its goal was to understand the circumstances in which police carry out searches of drivers. State law requires that, for each stop, records be kept of various aspects of the stop including the race of the driver. The study examined 69,543 stops that took place in 2007 in which searches were discretionary on the part of the police officer (i.e., when there were no outstanding warrants related to the driver).  Searches were most likely to take place when White officers stopped Black drivers (searches took place in 8.2% of stops) and were least likely when Black officers stopped White drivers (1.5% of stops).  Between these two extremes, White Officers were more likely to search White drivers (5.1% of stops) than were Black officers who stopped Black drivers (3.9% of stops)., Perhaps the most interesting findings relate to the effect of the racial composition of the community in which the traffic stop took place. St. Louis is roughly half Black and half White and is heavily segregated by race.  The income of White households is roughly twice that of Black households.    Nine districts in St. Louis were identified, three of which had a low representation of Black citizens (average 26%); three had medium representation of Blacks (72%) and three had very high concentrations of Black residents (96%).   In the areas with a relatively low concentrations of Blacks, the results were more or less the same as for the city as a whole. For the neighbourhoods with a medium concentration of Black residents, however, those with the highest likelihood of being searched were White drivers stopped by White police officers.  In areas with very high concentrations of Black residents, White drivers stopped by White officers were, again, most likely to be searched.  Situations in which both the driver and officer were Black were the least likely to result in a search. Other predictors of whether a search took place also varied across neighbourhoods suggesting, at a minimum, that police officers modify their decisions on whom to search according to the racial characteristics of the neighbourhood., Conclusion: The results suggest that despite the increase in the number of Black officers in the U.S., Black and White citizens are treated differently when they are stopped by the police.   But the data from neighbourhoods that differ in their racial composition suggest that “the racial composition of a community has a strong, [though]… not easily interpreted, influence on police search patterns” (p. 1016)., Reference: Rojek, Jeff, Richard Rosenfeld, and Scott Decker (2012).

Those who invoke criminal sanctions for accused people who don’t show up on time for court might take a lesson from North American dentists and send out reminder cards.,"Many North American dentists, who often make regular dental appointments weeks or months in advance of the scheduled appointment, send out postcards reminding their patients to show up for their appointments. Some even mention that there will be penalties for those who don’t show up.  This study examines whether courts could learn from the experience of dentists. It examines whether sending out reminder cards to those required to come to court reduces the ‘failure to appear’ rate., Accused people are punished for not appearing, when required, for court appearances on the assumption that – like most criminal offences – the act of not appearing for court is a motivated one.  The alternative perspective is that people may simply forget, or do not realize that showing up for court is seen, by courts, to be a serious matter.  If either of these is the case, then reminding them of their obligation to appear and explaining the consequences of failing to appear in court might be a way of reducing the number of failures to appear. Studies suggest that many defendants “lead disorganized lives, forget, lose the citation [the written notice they receive from the police] and do not know whom to contact to find out when to appear, fear the justice system and/or its consequences, do not understand the seriousness of missing court, have transportation difficulties, language barriers, are scheduled to work, have childcare responsibilities, or other reasons…” (p. 178)., This study, carried out in 14 counties in Nebraska, randomly assigned 7,865 accused adults who were charged with non-traffic misdemeanour offences to one of four experimental conditions.  One group was treated normally (and not given a reminder). A second group was sent a post-card simply reminding them of their hearing date, time, and place.  The third group was given the reminder and was told that there could be serious criminal consequences of not appearing.  The fourth group got the reminder and the explanation of sanctions but was also told that the courts try to treat people fairly., The results were simple.  All reminders worked, but explaining the sanctions that could be imposed for a failure to appear (with or without the ‘justice’ message) worked better.  The proportion of failures to appear were as follows:
No reminder:               12.6%
Reminder only:               10.9%
Reminder & sanction:   9.1%, These findings would suggest that there could be substantially fewer failures to appear if simple reminders were sent out that included the time and place of the court hearing and warnings about the criminal consequences of failing to appear. For example, if 1000 reminders were sent out in these jurisdictions, a reminder containing an explanation of the penalties for failure to appear in court would reduce the number of these ‘failures’ from 126 (with no reminder) to 91 (with this reminder and message).  Whether this is cost effective depends on how various cost estimates are made.  For example, using the actual data on the effect of the reminder, one could compare the cost of mailing 1000 reminders to the savings (criminal justice and social) from having 35 fewer failures to appear within this group of 1000 people., Conclusion:  It appears that simple reminders to those charged with criminal offences combined with educational material about the consequences of failing to appear for court can significantly reduce the rate of failures to appear.   The benefits, of course, accrue not only to the police and court system but also to accused people who otherwise might not appear in court. The results suggest, therefore, that courts can contribute to ‘crime control’ by simply adopting the business model of some dentists., Reference: Rosenbaum, David I., Nicole Hutsell, Alan J.

Legally required warnings to youths about the consequences of making statements to the police do little if anything to protect youths’ rights.,", Many jurisdictions have special procedures to warn youths about the consequences of making statements to the police (e.g., the U.S. Miranda warning).  Developmental psychology suggests, however, that although youths may understand the meaning of the words they are told, they may lack the judgment and maturity to appreciate the purpose and importance of the rights they are being asked to waive. 
To understand the interrogation of youths, this study examined records of 307 interrogations of 16- and 17-year-olds charged with felonies in four Minnesota counties.  All were completed cases and constituted all formal police interrogations of 16-17 year-olds that took place in these counties between 2003 and 2006. The data examined included recordings of these interrogations (which were required by the state courts), the police reports related to the cases, as well as court records. Most of the youths (69%) had been arrested prior to the incident in which they were interrogated and most (57%) had been to court before.  Their charges varied considerably., To get youths to waive their rights, police used ‘standard’ interrogation techniques, including “communicating the value of talking – ‘telling her story’ – and telling the truth before they gave a Miranda warning” (p. 10-11).  When speaking to the youths, police sometimes referred to the warning as a formality or a bureaucratic exercise, but were careful to ensure that youths indicated that they understood the warning.  93% of the youths who were interviewed waived their rights to silence and to counsel.  Those youths with prior felony arrests were somewhat less likely to waive their rights (87%) than were those with no prior felony arrests (95%).  But even ‘experienced’ youths were largely willing to talk to the police., Most interrogations were very short: 77% took 15 minutes or less. Only 10% took more than 30 minutes.  Most youths (80%) were cooperative with the police.  It appeared that “most juveniles did not require a lot of persuasion or intimidation to cooperate” (p. 14). The police used a variety of ‘standard’ interrogation techniques that are used with adults. In 69% of the cases they used one or more ‘maximization’ techniques which are designed to “convey the interrogator’s rock-solid belief that the suspect is guilty and that all denials will fail” (p. 5). These included confronting the youth with evidence such as statements from witnesses or co-accused (54% of cases). In 33% of the cases the police accused the youth of lying and in about 30% they urged the youth to tell the truth.  Another set of techniques involved “minimizing tactics [on the part of the police officer which] offer face-saving excuses or moral justifications that reduce a crime’s seriousness, provide a less odious motivation or shift blame…” (p. 15). As with adults, these were used less frequently than ‘maximization techniques’ (17% of cases).  Most youths (59%) “confessed within a few minutes of waiving Miranda and did not require prompting by police” (p. 17).  Only 12% did not make incriminating admissions., Conclusion: Statements from youths were rarely excluded from court hearings. “Police [in these interrogations] acted professionally and complied with Miranda’s protocol – there is no ambiguity about warnings and waivers. In addition, most juveniles confess and tapes provide unimpeachable evidence of their statements” (p. 23).  However, “Miranda’s assumption that a warning would enable suspects to resist the compulsive pressures of interrogation is demonstrably wrong” (p. 24).   Youths, like adults, may understand the words in the warning, but they “lack ability to understand and competence to exercise rights” (p. 24).  This article suggests youths be required to consult a lawyer before waiving their rights, because if they “cannot understand and exercise rights without legal assistance, then to treat them as if they do denies fundamental fairness and enables the state to exploit their vulnerability” (p. 26)., Reference: Feld, Barry C.  (2013).

Prosecutors allow departures from “mandatory” sentences for drug offenders who appear to be ‘good’ people.,", Mandatory sentencing systems are most likely to be criticized because at times they require the imposition of disproportionate sentences.  Many European ‘mandatory’ minimum sentences allow judges to depart if the sentence would otherwise be inappropriate and reasons are given for the departure.  When such principled approaches are not available, decision makers may find alternative ways of mitigating the impact of rigid and harsh sentencing systems., The United States Sentencing Commission guidelines, before 2005, made it almost impossible for judges to depart from the prescribed guideline sentence.  The most important way of departing (downwards) was the prosecutor’s request for a departure from the judge for “substantial assistance” given by the convicted person to the prosecutor. The judge would then determine the size of the departure (if any).  Drug sentences under these guidelines are determined almost completely by the type and weight of the drug and the offender’s criminal record. As a consequence, substantial assistance departures were important because they constituted almost the only way less-than-normal sentences could be imposed., This study, carried out in three mid-western US judicial districts, examined which drug offenders (in 1515 cases) received substantial assistance departures. 41% of these cases received such departures.  If a case received a departure, the reduction in sentence averaged about 50% (a reduction of over 5 years)., Departures were more likely to be given for three types of offenders: women, those with some post-secondary education, and those who were US citizens.   In addition, the 35% of offenders who had not been held in pretrial custody were more likely than those who were in custody to receive a departure. Those whose most serious offence was a conspiracy charge were more likely to receive a departure than those facing an ordinary drug charge (e.g., trafficking).  There were differences across the three districts, with substantial assistance departures more prevalent in Nebraska and Minnesota than in the Southern District of Iowa.  In addition, when they were given, departures were larger in Nebraska and Minnesota than they were in Southern Iowa., Neither drug type nor race was a significant predictor of substantial assistance departures.  However, because those convicted of offences related to ‘crack cocaine’ are disproportionately black, it is hardly surprising that race did not have an additional simple effect.  The offender’s role in the offence (minor, aggravated or normal) did not have an impact on the likelihood of receiving a ‘substantial assistance’ departure, perhaps because this was one of the factors that had already been taken into account in sentencing., Conclusion. It seems unlikely that all of the 41% of offenders in this sample who received downward departures offered the prosecutors substantial assistance.  They would all have needed to possess  useful information to exchange for a lower sentence. Similarly, it seems unlikely that women, citizens, those with some college or university education, and those not in custody at the time of sentence would have more information to trade than men, non-citizens, less educated defendants, and those in custody at the time of their sentencing. Instead, those who received substantial assistance offers from the prosecutors and less harsh sentences from the judges probably were not seen to be as serious offenders as others.  More generally, since the Supreme Court decisions shifting the guidelines from ‘mandatory’ to ‘advisory’ appeared to have little overall impact on sentencing patterns (see Criminological Highlights V12N6#6), these findings suggest that those ‘given a break’ from harsh sentencing regimes may simply be those seen by the prosecutor and/or the judge as sympathetic offenders., Reference: Cano, Mario V. and Cassia Spohn (2012).  Circumventing the Penalty for Offenders Facing Mandatory Minimums.  Criminal Justice and Behavior, 39 (3), 308-322., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV13N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-13-no-4-%E2%80%93-june-2013,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 13, No. 4 – June 2013",Regular Issue,2013
Imprisonment does not reduce the likelihood of reoffending.,", One of the traditional justifications for imprisonment is that it will increase the likelihood that offenders will stop offending and become reintegrated into society (e.g., by getting a job).  The theory is that through one or more mechanisms – specific deterrence, rehabilitation, job training, separating the offender from a criminogenic community, or simply ‘breaking the cycle’ of offending –  imprisonment will help them stop offending., The data do not support this view. Research comparing those sent to prison (as compared to those receiving community sanctions) suggests that prison is more likely to increase future offending than it is to decrease it (Criminological Highlights¸ V11N1#1, V11N1#2, V11N5#2, V11N6#4, V13N2#3).  This finding also appears to hold for youths (V10N6#1, V11N4#3, V12N5#7). In addition to studies using advanced statistical techniques to create comparable groups who are sentenced to prison or not, studies in which offenders are essentially randomly assigned to receive a prison or non-prison sanction (V3N4#4, V11N4#2) show the same effect: experiencing prison does not reduce reoffending., This paper takes advantage of the fact that in the state courts in Chicago, criminal cases are randomly assigned to the judges. Each judge hears a wide variety of cases including violent offences such as sexual offences and robbery (10% of the cases), property offences such as burglary or theft (29%), weapons offences (8%) and drug offences (53%).  This study shows that the judges varied in the punitiveness of their sentences.  Overall, about 35% of offenders were incarcerated. However, the least punitive judge sent only 26% of those found guilty to prison, whereas the most punitive judge sentenced 47% to prison. The study looked at relatively low level felony convictions to ensure that offenders would be released fairly soon after conviction if they were incarcerated. Though not the focus of this study, reoffending, not surprisingly, was related to race, age, the number of prior arrests, and offence., Typically, of course, judges tend to imprison the ‘worst’ offenders – usually those with the longest criminal records.  This normally makes it difficult to see whether there is an actual causal effect of imprisonment on offending.   However, in this study, because judges varied in their punitiveness, and cases were randomly assigned to judges, there was an opportunity to see whether punitiveness of the sentences handed down above and beyond the characteristics of the case had an impact on recidivism., Recidivism for this group of offenders was relatively high:  the 5-year recidivism rates for those offenders who were sentenced by the 25 judges varied between about 60% and 70%.  Most importantly, however, there was no relationship between the punitiveness of the judge and the recidivism rate for offenders sentenced by each judge.  Said differently, the most punitive judges were no more successful in stopping crime than the least punitive judges. Judges, it would appear, aren’t responsible for crime., About half of these offenders had been convicted previously of an offence, and about 80% had previously been arrested.  In other words, many had a history of involvement in the criminal justice system.  Five years after the conviction and sentencing examined in this study, fewer than 20% were involved in employment that could be tracked through deductions from their pay for social security purposes.  Most importantly in terms of the purpose of this study, the rate of  employment (based on this measure) at five years after sentencing did not vary for those dealt with by the most punitive compared to the least punitive judges., Conclusion: It appears that variation in the use of prison had no effect on reoffending; nor did it have any impact on ordinary employment five years after sentencing. Instead, “these results reinforce the perspective that prisons function primarily as custodial institutions – interrupting but not fundamentally altering, the average life-course trajectory of their temporary inhabitants” (p. 157)., Reference: Loeffler, Charles E.

Traditional religious beliefs may be used by serious street offenders to justify – rather than question – their offending.,", Most traditional criminological theory would suggest that holding religious beliefs should strengthen the bonds between potential offenders and society. Stronger bonds with traditional values should, in turn, reduce offending because of the incongruity between offending and traditional religious beliefs. For example, “In western society the notion of punishment in the afterlife is assumed to be a powerful deterrent of deviance and is the bedrock of how many religions seek to control human behaviour” (p. 50)., On the other hand, for specific groups of people – those involved in serious street crimes, for example – religion may play a very different role.   Many serious offenders experience a “heightened sense of futurelessness…  [and] with no future prospects, [they] have little to lose by engaging in crime and violence…” (p. 52).   In this context, religious beliefs might have quite a different relationship to offending., In this study, 48 (6 females, 42 males) non-institutionalized Black residents of Atlanta, Georgia, who were actively involved in serious offences (drug dealing, robbery, carjacking, burglary) were interviewed in their own high crime neighbourhoods.  Most (45 of the 48) reported being adherents of a specific religion (Christianity, for 44 of those interviewed). Most (40 of the 48) anticipated dying early as a result of their criminal behaviour., Within this group of 48 offenders, religious doctrine was seen as supporting or facilitating crime in three ways.  First, the offender’s God was seen as a forgiving God: “God has to forgive everyone, even if they don’t believe in him” (p. 59), explained one respondent.  Another explained that everyone was fighting to get to heaven because “we already in Hell, you know” (p. 59)., Second, some offenders had unconventional views of traditional religion.  Thus, for example, one respondent noted that “Jesus knows I ain’t have no choice… He know I’m stuck in the hood and just doing what I gotta do to survive.  But you know if you [poking the interviewer in the chest] rob somebody, then you might get punished because you going to the Perly Gates and Jesus going to be like, why you robbing motherfuckers when I gave you a nice job and a nice life already?” (p. 60).  It appears that such interpretations of religion “served offenders well in justifying their behaviour” (p. 60)., Finally, some argued that their criminal behaviour was either permissible or condoned: “If God wasn’t forgiving, I wouldn’t be living… he’s probably protecting you….” (p. 61). Continued offending “was often viewed as ‘part of God’s plan’” (p. 61)., Conclusion:  Many of these offenders “actively referenced religious doctrine to justify past offences and to excuse the continuation of serious criminal conduct” (p. 62).  But it should not be thought that “this criminogenic effect accrues from the content of religious doctrine per se.  Rather it appears to be the result of either an imperfect or purposefully distorted understanding of [religious] doctrine, applied by the offender to their decision-making process” (p. 62).  The offenders, then, were able “to reconcile their belief in God with their serious predatory offending.  They frequently employed elaborate and creative rationalizations in the process and actively exploited religious doctrine to justify their crimes…. There is reason to believe that these rationalizations and justifications may play a criminogenic role in their decision making” (p. 62)., Reference: Topalli, Volkan, Timothy Brezina and Mindy Berhardt (2012).

"Some corrections programs can reduce reoffending, but some ‘corrections’ programs can increase offending.",", The idea that ‘corrections’ programs, at worst, will have no impact has been shown to be wrong.  One of the most famous examples of this was a random assignment study starting in 1939 in which youths in Massachusetts who received intensive social and psychological interventions were compared, 30 years later, to an equivalent group who received no special treatment.  Those who received the intensive intervention fared worse 30 years later (Criminological Highlights V5N4#1).  Similarly, a ‘quick fix’ prevention program, Scared Straight, also increased offending by youths exposed to it (Criminological Highlights, V6N2#4)., On the other hand, certain kinds of rehabilitation programs – properly administered to the appropriate people – can reduce offending.  Generally speaking, programs that address individual deficits associated with criminal behaviour which – at least in theory – are modifiable can be effective.  These programs may reduce the likelihood of future offending because they “are capable of creating a cognitive change in criminal thinking [or] criminogenic attitudes” (p. 10)., However, this does not mean that such programs are automatically successful.  A person must be ready to change and have an opportunity to change (e.g.,  through employment or marriage) before a change in self-concept occurs and previous lifestyles are no longer seen as attractive.   This article suggests that for treatment to be effective, the participants must “visualize a different and rewarding noncriminal future” (p. 12).   “When programs appropriately adhere to the principles of risk, need, and responsivity, they can effectively reduce recidivism. [However,] many programs do not follow these principles” (p. 15).  But in addition, little is known about “how to ensure that these [therapeutic] programs are delivered with fidelity and/or therapeutic integrity, or the extent to which interventions conform to the manner of service intended by the developers of the service” (p. 14).   Simply put, programs motivated by good intentions and which sound good, may not work., On the other hand, some programs are known to be ineffective.  Increasing punishment severity or control of adult or young offenders does not appear to reduce crime.  At the same time, other programs that may be very effective at making ex-offenders better citizens do not necessarily reduce offending for all types of offenders.  Employment programs, for example, do not appear to be effective unless the offender is ready to change (Criminological Highlights, V4N3#6, V12N4#8).  These results do not mean that employment programs for offenders should be abandoned. Instead, they should, perhaps, be evaluated -- just as they are for non-offender groups -- in terms of whether they help people get and maintain employment., Conclusion:  Programs to reduce offending – whether aimed at custodial populations or non-custodial populations – cannot be assumed to work just because they look as if they might.  The examples of programs that make matters worse remind us of the admonition that program designers should ensure they “First do no harm.”  Harm, of course, can be measured in various ways: increasing offending by those who receive the programs, or harming those people or communities associated with those receiving the program., Reference: MacKenzie, Doris Layton (2013).  First Do No Harm: A Look at Correctional Policies and Programs Today.  Journal of Experimental Criminology, 9, 1-17., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV13N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-13-no-4-%E2%80%93-june-2013,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 13, No. 4 – June 2013",Regular Issue,2013
"Human trafficking may be a cause for concern, but Canada’s experience with its 2005 legislation suggests that its attempt to criminalize the issue is problematic and has accomplished little.",", Human trafficking is usually defined as involving the transportation of people across borders with “the use of threats, force, coercion or fraud, resulting in conditions of servitude, slavery or commercial sexual exploitation of an individual” (p. 22)., Recently, there has been increased concern about the problem, notwithstanding the fact that it is impossible to know how large a problem it actually is. However, “feminist organizations have played a key role in human trafficking campaigns from the beginning of the 20th century to the present day” (p. 24).  These campaigns have been based on two main perspectives. The first argues that human trafficking is “modern day slavery” (p. 24). The opposing view, “represented by sex workers’ rights activists,” … “argues that not every prostitute and migrant sex worker is forced or coerced into their situation” (p. 24)., The current international anti-trafficking convention, known as the Palermo Protocol (implemented by the U.N. in 2000), “specifies that in order to uncover trafficking networks, it is crucial to treat trafficked individuals as victims and not perpetrators of crime” (p 28).  Further it states that the prohibited conduct – recruitment, transportation, etc., of persons through coercion, threats, etc., for the purposes of exploitation (sexual exploitation, forced labour, etc.) – should be criminalized.  In 2005 Canada did that by making it an offence to recruit, transport, etc., a person, or exercise control, etc., over them for the purpose of exploiting them. Those who knowingly receive a benefit from these activities have also committed an offence., Canada’s law, although referred to as involving the ‘trafficking in persons’, does not require that the victim actually be moved. What is critical is the exploitation.  One of the key factors that distinguishes human trafficking from other forms of exploitation is the inability of the victim to consent to being trafficked, since consent obtained under deception, control, threats, and so on, is not valid (p. 24).  Yet, this definition of ‘exploitation’ has allowed for the victim’s consent to the prostitution-related activities to be ignored, since the conditions in which the consent was given fall under suspicion.  Exploitation can be broader than just prostitution, but, where it involves prostitution, it becomes almost impossible to distinguish ‘trafficking’ from what is commonly referred to as ‘pimping.’, Canada’s first prosecution under this legislation clearly could have come under pre-existing laws relating to the “living off of the avails of prostitution” in that the convicted man had been charged in relation to his involvement in the prostitution of two underage girls. In fact, one girl apparently gave evidence that she did not fear for her safety.  The accused was convicted of living off the avails of juvenile prostitution for one girl and for ‘human trafficking’ with respect to the other.  In another case, a man was charged with ‘human trafficking’ in Toronto in relation to a woman from another Canadian city whom he assaulted after she tried to leave. He was found guilty of assault. “In several convicted cases of trafficking in Canada, there was clear indication of some romantic involvement between the accused and the alleged victims” (p. 40), which is not uncommon for those classified as pimps and prostitutes., Other cases are similar: other charges (e.g., assault, living off the avails of prostitution, forcible confinement, kidnapping) could have been laid instead of ‘trafficking’, and are more likely to lead to conviction than the original trafficking charges.  The cases in the first 3-4 years of the law “demonstrate police inclination toward laying human trafficking charges despite vague evidence” (p.35-36)., Conclusion: By removing the ‘transportation’ component of ‘human trafficking,’ Canadian law has removed the critical distinction between ‘human trafficking’ and other related offences.  But in addition, although it is often alleged that ‘human trafficking’ involves ‘organized crime’, the prosecutions, thus far, have not demonstrated that link.  The law also, then, may be little more than the “re-labelling [of] offences [that] can have serious implications for those involved, as it also undermines the severity of human trafficking by equating it with very small-scale ‘pimping’ and misdirects police attention, preventing them from uncovering situations of true human trafficking” (p. 40-41)., Reference: Roots, Katrin (2013).  Trafficking or Pimping: An Analysis of Canada’s Human Trafficking Legislation and its Implications.  Canadian Journal of Law and Society, 28(1) 21-41., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV13N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-13-no-4-%E2%80%93-june-2013,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 13, No. 4 – June 2013",Regular Issue,2013
The low imprisonment rates of the Nordic countries are rooted in their cultural and political traditions.,", Unlike many countries, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden have for at least four decades based penal policies on research findings.  It was well established decades ago that most people have broken laws; hence there was never much support in these countries for the belief that ‘offenders’ were abnormal and needed intensive treatment or punishment.   Throughout the second half of the 20th century, punishment generally and imprisonment in particular, were not seen in any of these countries as an adequate solution to crime., When it became clear in the early 1950s that Finland had an imprisonment rate three times that of its Scandinavian neighbours, the decision was made to reduce imprisonment even though during this same period reported crime was increasing in all four countries.  The increase in crime in Finland was very similar to that in the three other Scandinavian countries (which had relatively stable imprisonment rates throughout this period), supporting the conclusion that crime and imprisonment rates are fairly independent of one another., A wide range of different policies account for Finland’s success in reducing imprisonment, including a ‘harm reduction’ approach to drugs rather than a goal to eradicate all drug use.  On the other hand, there were some changes in maximum penalties for certain (largely violent) offences.  Not until the 1990s (in Sweden) did crime policy become an election issue in this region.  In Finland in 1998, crime became a political issue as it did in Denmark after 2001.   However, the political talk about crime did not translate into increased imprisonment.  The result is that the Nordic countries (Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland) have an average imprisonment rate in 2012 that is lower than all other regions of Europe (Nordic rate per 100,000 residents: 65; Western Europe: 88; Southern Europe: 123; Britain and Ireland: 135; Canada: 117; Australia: 129, New Zealand 190; USA: 730).  Most of the difference between the Nordic countries and the rest of Europe can be traced to shorter sentences in the former, though some of the difference relates to fewer sentences of imprisonment in that region than elsewhere., Social attitudes and policies in other areas are also likely to be relevant to understanding rates of imprisonment in the Nordic countries. Compared to residents in other European countries, residents of the Nordic countries appear to show more trust in people generally and in the police, courts, and the justice system.  Compared to the rest of Europe, the Nordic countries have less economic inequality and more public expenditures on social programs.  This article suggests that “by providing workable alternatives to imprisonment…[and] by indirectly promoting social and economic equality and security…” (p. 105) imprisonment rates can be kept relatively low., Conclusion: Low imprisonment rates in the Nordic countries didn’t “just happen.”  They are low because of policy choices that were made to keep them low. But in addition, legislated sentencing structures provide only broad guidance and leave individual decisions to judges, a practice which “seems to be less vulnerable to short-sighted and ill-founded political interventions…” (p. 106).   Nevertheless, there are differences; Swedish legislators, for example, are “more willing to act quickly and pass ‘single-problem solutions’ [to crime problems]” (p. 107).  More generally, however, “the future of Nordic penal policy is very much the future of the Nordic welfare model” (p. 107)., Reference: Lappi-Seppälä, Tapio (2012).

"Even in situations in which citizens face terrorist threats and attacks, the legitimacy of the local police is determined, in large part, by whether the police are perceived to be treating people in a procedurally just fashion.","“Increasing public evaluations of the legitimacy of the police is considered one of the most important goals of policing in democratic countries” (p. 5).  A number of studies have highlighted the importance of perceptions of procedural justice – the fairness and appropriateness of police interactions with ordinary citizens – in understanding public assessments of, and cooperation with, the police (Criminological Highlights, V4N4#1, V7N1#4, V11N4#1, V12N5#2).   The suggestion is sometimes made, however, that in situations in which people feel under severe threat – e.g., acute crises or terrorism threats – it is police efficacy rather than fairness that is seen as important., The data for this study come from a study of public attitudes in the jurisdictions of 6 Israeli police stations, one of which (Sderot) has been “a primary target for missile threats and attacks originating from the Gaza Strip” (p. 10).  It was expected that “in situations of high threat and insecurity… concerns for safety [would] take priority over issues of fair processes such as respect, dignity and participation [the main ‘pillars’ of procedural justice]” (p. 11).   The five other ‘comparison’ districts had not experienced recent security threats.  Only members of ‘majority communities’ were included in the analysis (i.e., Israeli Arabs, Ultra-Orthodox Jews, and other minorities were excluded)., Police legitimacy – the main dependent variable – was assessed with four questions: “The police are guided by the public’s well-being;” “The police carry out their job well;” “If a relative/friend was a victim of a crime I would encourage them to turn to the police;” and “I have trust in the Israeli police” (p. 15).  Police performance/efficiency was operationalized with two questions: “The Police efficiently handle crime in my area of residence;” and “Police presence in my area of residence is adequate” (p. 16)., Perceptions of procedural justice were measured with four questions: “The police allow citizens to express their opinion before making a decision…;”  “The police explain their activities well…;”  “The police treat all citizens equally;” and “Officers treat citizens they encounter with respect” (p. 15). Various other controls were also included (e.g., previous contact with the police, whether the respondent had been a crime victim, and demographic characteristics of respondents)., The results were quite straightforward.  The performance/ efficiency of the police was important in both the ‘high terrorism’ area and in the comparison areas, but, as predicted “under conditions of threat, evaluations [of performance] play a significantly larger role in predicting police legitimacy than when there is no specific threat in the background” (p. 18).  More interesting, however, is the fact that procedural justice was equally important in predicting police legitimacy in both the ‘high threat’ and the ‘low threat’ areas., Conclusion: “The results of the present study suggest that the desire for procedural justice is an enduring, stable trait, regardless of the security situation. Under conditions of security threats, individuals do value police performance to a greater extent when forming evaluations of police legitimacy. However, there does not seem to be a zero-sum game between performance and procedural justice: under threat, while performance increases in importance, procedural justice does not decline in importance and indeed remains the primary antecedent of legitimacy, as is the case when there is no security threat in the background”  (p. 19). In more mundane terms, the police cannot afford to minimize the importance of dealing with citizens in a procedurally just fashion just because the community is facing serious external threats., Reference: Jonathan-Zamir, Tal and David Weisburd (2013).

"Intensive foot patrols by police can reduce street crime, but the effects don’t last after police strength is reduced to normal.",", Previous research has demonstrated “that highly intensive policing can modestly reduce the number of violent crimes that take place in an area” (Criminological Highlights V12N3#3).  This study is a follow-up of an earlier study that examined the impact on crime of intensive 2-person patrols during a 12-week period. The earlier study compared the rate of street crime in areas that received intensive 2-person foot patrols (as well as adjacent areas) to the street crime rates in similar locations that (on a random basis) did not receive intensified foot patrols.  The crime reducing effect of the foot patrols was demonstrated, but the amount of crime reduction was not large. It was estimated for every 2174 person-hours of patrol, one crime was averted., Aside from the cost of implementing high intensity police foot patrols in a neighbourhood, little is known about their long term impact. In particular, it is important to know whether the crime-reducing effects of intensive patrols remain after policing strength (and, therefore, visible presence) returns to ‘normal’ levels.  During the ‘intensified foot patrol’ period of the original study, foot patrol officers were responsible for a 64% increase in pedestrian stops, a 7% increase in vehicle stops, and a 13% increase in arrests., This study focuses on the first 15 month period after the intensive foot patrols ceased.  From a practical perspective, this period is important because it tests whether the effects of intensive patrols were long-lasting, or whether the effect only lasted while the police officers were present and visible on the street.  Previous research (e.g., Criminological Highlights V7N6#1) would suggest that one should not expect the effects of the intensive patrol to last after the patrols stop., In fact, that is what happened.  As soon as the extra patrols left, the crime suppressing effect disappeared.   “No significant differences were found between the treatment and control areas on levels of violence from the beginning to the end of the post-treatment period” (p. 83).  In fact, there was no evidence of a gradual decay:  the effects of the intervention ended abruptly when the intensive patrols ended.  Crime, in effect, returned to expected levels., The original study also looked at displacement of crime into adjacent areas.  After the intensive patrols stopped, crime in the areas adjacent to where the intensive patrols had taken place went down suggesting that some crime might have moved back to the areas from which it had been displaced during the intensive foot patrols., Conclusion: It would seem that “the effects of crackdowns [in the form of intensive police foot patrols] are short term and [they] decay rapidly” (p. 87).   It has been suggested that intensive foot patrols deter crime because, in deterrence terms, they act as a “certainty communicating device.”  “In Philadelphia, once the ‘certainty communicating device’ was removed, no differences between the treatment [high intensity foot patrols] and control locations were detectable” (p. 87).   Since “most police agencies allocate patrol resources disproportionately at high-crime places…., it is questionable whether better funded crackdowns will elicit the aggregate crime reductions predicted.  It would appear that “more holistic strategies” (p. 92) are needed to fulfill the goal of effectively reducing the amount of crime in a neighbourhood., Reference: Sorg, Evan T., Cory P.

"Although parental incarceration is likely to have negative consequences on the prisoner’s children and those taking care of the prisoner’s children, the actual effect depends on the dynamics of the pre-existing relationships among prisoners, their families, and the caregivers.",", The Victoria, Australia, Sentencing Act (1991) instructs judges that the sentences they impose must reflect one or more of the standard sentencing purposes: deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation, just punishment and/or denunciation. Said differently, in, Research on the impact of parental incarceration has generally shown that the impact on the prisoner’s children (and spouses) is generally negative (e.g., Criminological Highlights V1N1#6, V9N5#6, V12N5#1, V12N6#7&8, V13N1#7).  However, this research typically ignores the nature of the pre-existing relationship between prisoners and their families., This study reports the results of detailed in-depth interviewers with 100 caregivers of children with at least one incarcerated parent – 54 fathers, 44 mothers, and two children with both parents incarcerated. Caregivers were the mother (n=39) or grandparents (n=40), fathers (n=12) or other family members (n=9). In most cases (n=58), the caregiver reported that parental incarceration had an overall negative impact on their lives, though in 20 cases there was a positive effect for the caregiver.  In the remaining 22 cases, the caregiver reported no overall impact., Negative impacts were easy to find: there was added financial stress on the family, but also the caregivers were left with fewer people who could help out in child rearing.  There were many reports of additional emotional stress on the caregiver as a result of the child’s distress at the loss of a parent.   “Many of these caregivers reported feeling ‘helpless,’ ‘overly stretched,’ and lost’” (p. 941). On the other hand, the impact was not always negative.  Some prisoners, when in the community, had been inconsistent or dysfunctional parents.  Their absence, then, made life for the (remaining) caregiver somewhat easier.  Caregivers who reported that there was no impact of the incarceration of the parent typically said that the prisoner had not been very involved in raising the child; hence the absence of the parent made no real difference.  “To assess the impact of incarceration on families, the extent and degree of parental involvement prior to incarceration must be considered… . Not all parents are involved in their children’s lives” (p. 936)., “Those [caregivers] who experienced a positive change [in their lives] reported having supportive family systems in their lives…  For many, … family support was present before the incarceration of the parent and remained a key source of assistance in their ability to provide for their children” (p. 942).  “Caregivers with cohesive, integrated family support systems fared differently… Variation in family support is critical for understanding whether caregivers will experience positive or negative changes in life circumstances as a result of parental incarceration” (p. 943)., Conclusion: The factors that were important in determining the impact on caregivers of children of incarcerated parents appeared to be the same across types of caregivers.  The pre-existing relationship with the incarcerated parent, and financial and emotional support from friends and families were important in understanding the impact on the caregiver.  For example, incarcerated mothers, in this study, appeared to have been different from incarcerated fathers in that they were more likely to have experienced various serious life traumas. Many of the remaining family members (fathers, grandparents) had distanced themselves from the mother prior to the incarceration.  Hence the impact of her incarceration was not seen as being as negative as the incarceration of the father.  This finding underlines the importance of understanding the nature of the pre-existing relationships.  Prior parental involvement, support systems, and interpersonal relationships combine to determine what the impact will be on those caring for the prisoner’s child., Reference: Turanovic, Jillian J., Nancy Rodriguez, and Travis C.

Those running anti-gang programs designed to target youths most at risk of gang involvement are not always successful in attracting such youths to their programs.,", In many cities, governments have made youth gang prevention and intervention in the lives of youths who might join gangs primary goals of their crime prevention programs.  The logic of these programs is to target “high rate offenders, especially youth most at risk of future gang membership” (p. 279-280).  While the logic is simple, there are two problems: identifying the most ‘at risk’ youths and getting them to participate in the program. The problem is that “only a small proportion of youth will ever become gang members… and very few youth have no risk factors associated with violence and gang membership, especially those who live in chronic gang communities.  [Hence]… the identification of youths with one or two risk factors associated with gang membership provides little discriminate validity for proper risk classification [as potential gang members]” (p. 281)., This study examined a targeted gang intervention program in Cleveland, Ohio. The intervention was part of a national anti-gang initiative funded by the U.S. government. Two samples were compared.  The first sample consisted of the 146 African American male youths who actively participated in the Cleveland program between 2007 and 2009. They were compared to 1,438 African American males in the metropolitan Cleveland area who were approximately the same age and were assessed in their schools during the same two year period.  All respondents – those in the program and those assessed in school – were given a 57-item questionnaire assessing their “risks” across 11 domains.  For the purpose of this study four domains known to be associated with gang membership and delinquency were examined: education, mental health, family, and delinquent peers., The problem with the selection of youths for the gang-prevention program became evident when the four overall risk domains and 12 sub-domains were examined.  There were significant differences between the two groups on three of the four domains – mental health, family and delinquent peer groups. The problem was that the non-program (non-targeted) youths were significantly more at risk than were the targeted youths who were in the program.  On education risks, there were no differences.  But on seven of the nine other sub-domains the non-targeted youths were, on average more at risk than the youths who were in the program. Essentially, then, the youths in the program were, on average, less at risk of becoming gang members than were ordinary Black youths in the Cleveland school system., One explanation for this finding may be that agencies seek out motivated youths.  “Street-level workers typically define motivation in terms of cooperation.  The motivated citizen-client is… deemed morally superior to the unmotivated. Conversely, the unmotivated, regardless of their need or circumstance, are deemed unworthy” (p. 288). More bluntly, the agencies may be seeking out youths who turn out not to be the most at risk of joining gangs., Conclusion: These findings suggest “that the ability of local agencies to identify youths most at risk for delinquency and gang membership should not be taken for granted” (p. 286).  The various social service providers in the city were given contracts to identify youths most at risk.  Obviously these youths were hard to identify and, probably, even harder to bring to the program.  But not only are the most ‘at risk’ youth not being targeted, it is well established that lower risk youths do not benefit from intensive programs, and indeed in some cases appear to respond to intervention programs by increasing their involvement in delinquent acts (see Criminological Highlights, V5N4#1).  In other studies it has been demonstrated that many of those involved in programs have self-selected into the program.  The programs, then, may quite possibly be “targeting ‘success prone’ clients, while excluding those individuals who may be more difficult to change – a practice [that is apparently] widespread in crime and delinquency interventions” (p. 287)., Reference:  Melde, Chris, Stephen Gavazzi, Edmund McGarrell and Timothy Bynum (2011).

Getting offenders jobs after they are released from prison contributes to lower recidivism.,", “A wide range of theoretical approaches assumes a crime-preventative effect of employment” (p. 630). However, it is well known that those released from prison, like those with criminal records generally, have a great deal of difficulty getting a job (e.g. Criminological Highlights V6N3#2). Given that prisoners tend to have lower levels of education and fewer job skills than other members of the community, it is not surprising that many do not have jobs even months after their release from prison., This study, carried out in Norway,  takes advantage of the fact that in Norway, each person has a unique numerical identifier which allows researchers to track (legal) employment, the receipt of social assistance,  job training programs, education, and arrests of those released from prison. The study tracked all 7,476 individuals who were released from prison in 2003 in Norway after serving a sentence. For those who served more than one sentence during that year, the first sentence was used as the focus of attention.  These offenders were then tracked until the end of 2006.  54% re-offended by the end of 2006 and 44% had obtained some amount of legal employment before re-offending or coming to the end of the follow-up period., Various controls were included in the analysis including age, sex, number of months at risk after release from prison, sentence length and the type of offence they had been imprisoned for as well as various other ‘control variables’ (drug use, education, immigrant background, income in the year prior to being sentenced, marital and family status, and education). These former prisoners were followed from their release until the date of their first subsequent offence.  Some inmates took a long time to find any employment, and employment was not necessarily consistent after ex-prisoners started working., Without controls, it is not surprising that those who had employment at some point subsequent to their release were less likely to reoffend than those who never were gainfully employed.  The size of this effect decreased – but was still statistically significant – after the numerous controls (e.g. their previous employment income) were included in the model., Reoffending was reduced for those who had some form of employment even if the amount that they earned was relatively little. Similarly the impact of having some employment could be seen across all types of offenders (drug, economic, violence, property crimes and driving) though there was some indication that the effects were larger for those originally sentenced for property and economic offences., Conclusion:  Obviously it is possible that the relationship between having some kind of employment and reduced reoffending could be, at least in part, due to self-selection: those motivated and able to get jobs may be less likely to reoffend not because of the job but because of other unmeasured factors.  The analysis shows that some of the variation in reoffending rates is due to these selection effects.  However, the extensive controls that were included in the model would support the conclusion that having some employment after being released from prison had some causal impact in reducing reoffending.  The findings underline, therefore, the importance of reducing barriers to employment for those being released from prison., Reference: Skardhamar, Torbjørn and Kjetil Telle (2012).

Black-White differences in involvement in adolescent violence can be explained by examining the effects of differences in the neighbourhoods in which youths live and in the schools that they attend.,", Many studies have demonstrated that Black American youths exhibit higher rates of violence than do White American youths.  There is an increasing amount of evidence that these differences disappear “once neighbourhood and family disadvantages are held constant” (p.141). Knowing how those disadvantages have an impact on violence rates may help understand violence generally and Black-White differences in violence more specifically.  More importantly, understanding the causes of this difference in violence rates might help identify policies that can reduce violence rates for all youths., This study looks at data associated with 1,801 Black and 3,521 White adolescents in 1,237 U.S. neighbourhoods.  These youths were interviewed first when they were age 12-16. After that, they were interviewed yearly for 5 years. The major dependent variable was whether the person had “attacked someone with the intention of hurting them in the past year” (p. 146). If they had, they were asked “to indicate the frequency with which they did so” (p. 146). Blacks reported higher levels of violence.  But Black respondents were also from families with lower incomes, were more likely to have delinquent peers and lower levels of verbal ability, and were more likely to attend schools rated as less conducive to learning and prosocial behaviour.  Blacks were also more likely than Whites to live in neighbourhoods with large numbers of people living below the poverty line, high unemployment, and many female-headed households., In simple analyses, each of these forms of disadvantage appeared to be related to self-reported violence by the youth.  Previous studies have suggested that “verbal ability is influenced by the neighbourhood and family contexts in which children live…. Neighbourhood disadvantage weakens the family learning environment and fosters inconsistency in parental practices….  Poor families lack the social and economic resources required for the nurturing of effective learning within the home (e.g., help with homework, computer access)….” (p. 143)., The effects of race of the youth were reduced to statistical non-significance, however, when verbal ability of the youth and other demographic and neighbourhood variables were taken into account.  It would appear that “low verbal ability and diminished school attainment are criminogenic risk factors that are in part outcomes of exposure to neighbourhood disadvantage” (p. 154-5).  In addition, the effect of neighbourhood disadvantage on violent behaviour was reduced considerably when the verbal ability of the youth was taken into consideration.  “Much of the effect of verbal ability on violence appears to be indirect, operating primarily though school achievement” (p. 152)., Conclusion: “These results support the view that neighbourhood and family disadvantages have detrimental repercussions for the acquisition of verbal ability which, in term, serves as a significant protective factor against violence” (p. 153).  Because Black youths are more likely to grow up in disadvantaged neighbourhoods, it follows that they would be more likely to have lower levels of verbal ability. This in turn disadvantages Black youths in school and in later life.  It would appear that “interventions to improve conditions in poor neighbourhoods” and to strengthen “families and early childhood learning in distressed neighbourhoods may help reduce the substantial risk for violence associated with frustration and in some cases failure in school” (p. 156).  Policies that address neighbourhood and educational disadvantage, then, may be good crime control policies and could, in addition, reduce youth violence by Black youths to levels exhibited by White youths., Reference: McNulty, Thomas L, Paul E. Bellair, and Stephen J.

"Judges are very good at recognizing coerced confessions by accused people. Nevertheless, in the absence of strong evidence, judges appear to be willing to convict an accused on the basis of the coerced confession.",", When judges hear a confession that was obtained by improper coercive methods, they have a responsibility to exclude it from juries.  If the case is heard by a judge (alone), the assumption is that the judge can respond appropriately and give the confession no weight.  Similarly, it is assumed that if a confession is erroneously heard by a jury, judges can determine whether the error was harmless. Given that false confessions constitute a leading cause of wrongful convictions, admitting a coerced confession would appear to have definite risks (see Criminological Highlights V11N3#4, as well as V2N6#8, V5N4#5, V7N4#7)., Previous research has shown that “wittingly or unwittingly, judges, like juries, often do not disregard inadmissible information” (p. 152).  Juries are able to “perceive confessions as coerced when elicited through high-pressure tactics; yet, they use that evidence anyway as a basis for conviction” (p. 152)., In this study, judges from three US states (Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Missouri) participated in a study in which they were asked to evaluate written ‘trial evidence’ (p. 152).  Specifically, they were given one of six versions of a hypothetical murder case.  For half of the judges, there was strong incriminating evidence that the accused had committed the murder (a hair found at the scene that could have been his; some of the victim’s property was found at the defendant’s home).  In the ‘weak case’, the hair evidence was described as being inconclusive and a search of the defendant’s home found nothing., There were three confession conditions:  (1) no confession; (2) a low pressure confession in which the accused had been questioned for 30 minutes before confessing, with videotape evidence showing no coercive behaviour by the interrogators; and (3) a high pressure condition in which the defendant had been interrogated for 15 hours and the videotape showed the police threatening him with the death penalty, waving a gun, etc., Judges rated the strength of the evidence against the accused and were asked for the verdicts that they felt were appropriate. In the strong evidence condition, the confession had little effect on either the ratings of the evidence strength or the verdicts: judges almost always said they would find the accused guilty and rated the evidence as very strong., In the weak evidence conditions, however, the evidence against the accused person in the ‘high pressure’ confession condition was seen as considerably stronger than in the ‘no confession’ condition and only slightly less strong than in the ‘low pressure’ confession condition.  Verdicts mirrored these findings. In the weak evidence condition with no confession, only 17% of the judges would find the accused guilty. In the high pressure confession condition, 69% would find him guilty which was slightly lower than in the low pressure confession condition (95%)., Conclusion: Judges had no difficulty identifying coerced confessions.  Nevertheless, they gave confession evidence a lot of weight.  On the basis of an uncorroborated low-pressure confession, guilty verdicts in the ‘weak evidence’ conditions went from 17% to 95%.  More surprising is the fact that with essentially no other evidence, a confession obtained with substantial coercion increased the judges’ guilty findings from 17% to 69%. At the same time, judges generally, but not always, identified the ‘high pressure’ confession as being coerced, and saw its admission as being prejudicial. Nevertheless, when asked to decide whether the accused should be found guilty, perceptions of evidence strength predicted the verdict while ratings of the voluntariness of the confession did not, even though the coerced confession was responsible for the significant increase in the ratings of the strength of the evidence., Conclusion: Wallace, D.

The rate of intimate partner violence in a community is related to the adequacy of social services in the community as well as the ability of the police to respond to individual incidents.,", Debate about responding to intimate partner violence (IPV) has often focused solely on the question of whether there should be policies requiring automatic arrest and prosecution of those charged with IPV. Focusing on only this one issue has the effect of ignoring the possibility that other approaches – by the police and others – might be effective in reducing the incidence of this form of violence., The size of a police force as well as its policies on the arrest of those accused of IPV may be important in understanding this form of victimization. Police strength (measured as number of police per capita) might be related to the incidence of IPV because more adequately staffed police services may have developed detailed policies on how to respond to IPV (e.g., instructions to those receiving 911-calls) and may be more likely to have specialized domestic violence units. Each of these may relate to the quality of the response of police to IPV calls. Mandatory arrest laws, on the other hand, have not, in previous research, consistently been related to favourable outcomes for victims of intimate partner violence.   Independent of policing issues, there is some indication from previous research that providing social services to the victim of IPV (temporary shelter and housing support, counselling, children’s services, etc.) might help reduce IPV in that these services provide choices to women who can reasonably accurately predict (and therefore avoid) future incidents of IPV (see Criminological Highlights V3N2#7)., This study looked at self-reported violence experienced by women at the hands of intimate partners in the six months prior to being interviewed in US victimization surveys. A total of 487,166 women responded to the surveys between 1989 and 2004 in the 40 largest American cities. The number of sworn (local) police officers per 1000 residents in the year the woman was interviewed was used as a measure of police strength.  The number of social service employees per 1000 population in the city was used as a broad based indication of social services that might be available to the women.  Various other characteristics of the cities (e.g., economic disadvantage, female workforce participation) as well as for the women (e.g., age, household income, marital status) were controlled., The results demonstrated that women who lived in areas with larger police services and with higher concentrations of social service workers were less likely to have experienced IPV in the 6-month period prior to being interviewed.  Living in an area with mandatory arrest laws was unrelated to being victimized.   Neither of these measures (police strength and concentration of social service workers) gives much information about exactly what the mechanism might be for the effect., Conclusion:  These findings demonstrate that women who live in communities that invest in social services are less at risk of intimate partner violence.  Similarly, women living in cities with sufficient police to respond sensitively to intimate partner violence are less at risk of this form of victimization.  It seems likely that both of these factors relate to the more sensitive handling of the problem – both in terms of providing services for ‘at risk’ women and responding to the specific circumstances of the women who have been victimized.  The presence of mandatory arrest policies, however, had no impact on victimization demonstrating, perhaps, that simplistic responses to complex problems are not likely to be effective., Reference:  Xie, Min, Janet L.

Cooperation among members of organized crime groups in Italy is most likely to occur when they share information about violent acts.,"In non-criminal settings, there are many reasons why agreements between people are upheld.  There may be legally binding contracts; people may value their reputations for being trustworthy; or there may be informal sanctions imposed on those who break their word., In underworld settings, on the other hand, state enforcement mechanisms (e.g., courts) cannot be turned to if agreements are broken. In addition, there is no obvious source of good information about a person’s trustworthiness (or even that a person is not an undercover police officer or police informant).  Trust, within a criminal organization, is a difficult commodity to assess and achieve. In this paper, two mechanisms of trust are examined:  entrusting key tasks to kin, and sharing knowledge about violent acts.  With kin, one knows - at a minimum - who a person is.  Furthermore, it is easy to identify relatives of kin who can be punished.  Committing violent acts with another person means that people have compromising information on one another that can be used to ensure that people live up to their agreements., In this study, extensive records of wiretaps of two separate organizations – an Italian Mafia organization located north of Naples and a Russian Mafia organization operating in Rome – were analyzed. In each case, the idea was to see if kinship and shared information involving violence predicted cooperation between members of a group.  Cooperation was defined as the number of times people were in contact with each other.  Since very few of the actual contacts involved conflict (10% for the Italian group and 1% of the Russian contacts) contact meant that people were cooperating with one another in Mafia-related activities. Though the Italian group had many blood ties within the group, the Russians did not.  For the Russians, then, “extended kinship” was defined as having a blood tie with at least one other member of the group.  Many people (37% within the Italian group and 73% within the Russian group) shared information about violence with associates., The question, then, is: what predicts ‘cooperation’ (contact for activities related to the criminal organization) within each of these groups. Contacts were classified as serving, primarily, one of four purposes: group management (remuneration, monitoring, intimidation, and punishment of group members), resource acquisition, protection activities, or economic investments (legal and illegal).  There were, in the Italian group, 1828 contacts that were recorded (involving 202 people) and, in the Russian group, 758 contacts (involving 164 people).   The data used here involved only those people subsequently listed on the Italian government indictments of members of the two groups., The results demonstrate that having kinship ties with members of the group increased the likelihood of cooperation with other people in the group.  But in addition, “having shared information about violent acts increases the frequency of contacts occurring among two actors” (p. 278).  The effect of “shared information about violence” was stronger than the effect of kinship ties.  The effects of kinship – and the strong effect of shared information about violence – also predicted cooperation when only matters related to economic investments and resource acquisition were being discussed, suggesting that the effects still hold even when the activities themselves do not involve violence., Conclusion:  “Both kinship and sharing information about violence increase cooperation among law-breakers who wish to keep their identity unknown to the authorities” (p. 281).  Both can be seen as a form of hostage-taking: a member of a group can more easily be found and punished if he shares information with kin than with others.   “Sharing compromising information about acts of violence also helps foster cooperation by making each member hostage to all others and reducing his incentives to defect” (p. 281)., Reference: Campana, Paolo, and Federico Varese (2013).  Cooperation in Criminal Organizations: Kinship and Violence as Credible Commitments.  Rationality & Society, 25, 263-289., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV13N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-13-no-5-%E2%80%93-august-2013,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 13, No. 5 – August 2013",Regular Issue,2013
"If courts are interested in hearing what witnesses experienced during an offence, they might want to consider encouraging witnesses to give an uninterrupted narrative of what happened.",", “Procedures for giving testimony taken as normative by… judges and lawyers run against the way accounts of such events are given in normal social interaction” (p. 287). Quite often, however, court business is conducted “according to procedural conventions and in language that many lay people find bewildering and even unjust” (p. 288)., The challenge for the courts in receiving evidence from ordinary witnesses is to accomplish separate purposes simultaneously:  receiving only the evidence that is legally admissible and, at the same time, giving witnesses the “opportunity to help the court see events from their perspective.”  The origin of the conflict is simple: courts have rules that regulate testimony.  These rules do not exist in ordinary conversations and make the presentation of evidence quite unnatural to most witnesses., Part of the difficulty is that the limits on what witnesses can talk about – e.g. prior assaults that may have been declared inadmissible – make no sense to witnesses because they are, from the witness’ perspective, relevant to understanding the behaviour in question: why everyone acted in the manner that they did.   Similarly, ordinary questions that might be asked in cross examination also make no sense from the perspective of the witness.  For example, in one of the 65 crown court trials in England observed for this study, the following exchange occurred:
Defence lawyer: I suggest it was only 2 punches that you saw.
Witness: No, it was a fury of punches [demonstrating with her fists]… Why are you calling me a liar?  You were not there.  It was awful.  You were not there. 
Judge: …  Counsel is not suggesting he was there…. You are being cross-examined in a normal way….
Or in another assault case:
Crown: What eye was hurt?
Witness: I don’t know, as this wasn’t the first time I have received a black eye from [him]. He has quite a temper. 
From the witness’ perspective the presence of multiple incidents explains her failure to remember which eye had been blackened.  From the court’s perspective, the witness is introducing evidence, perhaps inadmissible, related to incidents not then before the court., In addition, witnesses frequently feel that they did not have sufficient opportunity to respond to questions from the other party, often because the lawyer interrupted the flow of the narrative or because the witness had been asked to answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’.  “A feeling that they should have said more, that important things were not elicited, was a common feature in witnesses’ post-trial interviews” (p. 301)., Although courts have a responsibility to establish what happened, they appear, for various reasons, to shun free narrative testimony.  This is, of course, quite different from the police who often ask witnesses, victims, and accused people to start by telling what happened in their own words.  Aside from anything else, this is clearly quite different from the often fragmented, unnatural (e.g., non-chronological) manner in which evidence is elicited in court in which explanations for behaviour are often excluded., Conclusion: Given the evidence favouring the accuracy of the narrative approach to gathering evidence, “permitting a greater measure of uninterrupted narrative testimony could raise evidential quality and improve lay people’s courtroom experience…” (p. 288). To some extent, there may be a trade-off between, on the one hand, allowing witnesses to recount their experiences in their own words, and, on the other hand structuring the evidence strictly according to rules of evidence (e.g., by forcing people to respond to questions with a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ rather than allowing them to explain the nuances of their answers)., Reference: Fielding, Nigel G.

"When witnesses don’t mention a detail of an event the first time they are asked to recall what they saw, but mention it when questioned later on, they may not be believed.  However, in fact, they are just as likely to be correct as they are with facts mentioned when first questioned.",", Inconsistencies in witnesses’ statements about what they recall are sometimes seen as indications that the statements are not accurate. The problem is that there are different forms of inconsistency. “While explicit contradictions necessarily imply that one statement is incorrect, the mere presence versus absence of a detail does not” (p. 266).  Jury instructions, however, often talk about inconsistency without differentiating between these., This paper examines two related phenomena: (a) the accuracy of items recalled for the first time after the person has witnessed an event and has already described that event; and (b) estimates, from a different group of people,  of how accurate these ‘reminiscences’ are., In the first study, undergraduate psychology students were shown a set of pictures.   Immediately after being shown the pictures, and then again 5 minutes, 20 minutes, and 1 week later, they were asked to describe as many details as they could.  They were unaware of the fact that there would be multiple tests.  Items recalled for the first time 5 minutes, 20 minutes, or a week after they had been shown the pictures and had been tested were, in fact, very accurately recalled.  Over 90% of these ‘new’ reports were accurate.  Law students were asked to describe their expectations of accuracy for events first recalled at one of these three times.  They indicated – incorrectly – that they thought that the accuracy of details recalled for the first time in the second and subsequent tests would be significantly lower than in the test that immediately followed the observation of the pictures.
  
In a second experiment, one group of students watched a short film clip and reported what they had seen. A week later, they were asked again to recall what they had seen. A different group of students were asked to guess how accurate such ‘witnesses’ would be.  ‘Witnesses’ recalled slightly fewer items a week after viewing the film than immediately after (22.5 vs. 24.6), but the average accuracy of their reports (over 90% accurate) did not change significantly.  Some items were recalled both times, some were only recalled at the first test and others were recalled only on the second test.  84% of the items recalled, for the first time, a week after viewing the film were, in fact, accurate.  However, people estimated that only 19% would be accurate.  Those items recalled immediately and a week later were accurate 93% of the time.  Those estimating accuracy guessed that about 58% of these memories would be correct.  Finally, those items recalled immediately, but not a week later, were accurate 91% of the time and people estimated that they would be accurate about 68% of the time., Conclusion: Ordinary people appear to believe that details of something that is witnessed which are recalled for the first time a long time after the event, but not immediately after, are likely to be inaccurate.  In fact, this does not appear to be the case.  In these studies, every ‘witness’ recalled at least one fact a long time after witnessing it but not immediately after the event, and most of these ‘reminiscences’ were, in fact accurate. In this study “Actual accuracy was [roughly] four times higher than expected [by those estimating it]” (p. 273).  Given that ‘reminiscence’ (recalling of details later, but not earlier) is common, the fact that these memories tend to be about as accurate as immediate recall is important when evaluating eyewitness accounts., Reference: Oeberst, Aileen (2012).  If Anything Else Comes to Mind… Better Keep It to Yourself?

"The proportion of people who indicate that they think that criminal courts are, in general, too lenient depends on how the question is asked.",", Public opinion polls in many western countries have found that most people indicate that sentences in criminal courts should be harsher than they are.  Though this finding may be fairly consistent across time and place, it is not clear what it means.  For example, few, if any, respondents in any country have sufficient information to evaluate the appropriateness of sentences generally.  The desire for harsh sentences is affected by relevant information made available to respondents such as the costs of imprisonment (see Criminological Highlights, 4(1)#5). And people may want harsh sentences because they believe, incorrectly, that harsh sentences reduce crime., This study looks at the effect of different wording of questions about sentence severity on the proportion of people who think that sentences are too lenient.  In two earlier surveys in the US, half of the sample was asked a version of the standard ‘sentence severity’ question: “In general, do you think the courts in this area deal too harshly or not harshly enough with criminals?”  Even though they were not offered a “Don’t know” alternative, in the first of these surveys about 7% volunteered that they didn’t know.  The other half of the respondents to this survey were asked a question which explicitly encouraged them to think about whether they had enough information: “In general, do you think that the courts in this area deal too harshly, or not harshly enough with criminal, or don’t you have enough information about the courts to say?”  In this case, 29% indicated that they couldn’t say.   Looking at the overall findings, 78% of the first sample indicated that they thought that courts were not harsh enough.  This dropped to 60% in the other sample which was offered a “Can’t say” option.  The results of the second survey were similar., In the current study, equivalent groups of students in Florida were asked about their views of sentences.  The respondents, on a random basis, were asked about their views using different questions. When asked a question that focused on harsh treatment – “In general, do you think the courts in this area deal too harshly or not harshly enough with criminals?” – 43% indicated that they thought that sentences were not harsh enough.  However, when asked what is logically the same question, except in a form that focuses on leniency – “In general, do you think the courts in this area are not lenient enough or too lenient with criminals” – only 30% of an identical group of students indicated that they thought that courts were too lenient., There was some indication that the questions were tapping into somewhat different attitudes.  For example, there was a significant relationship between politician conservatism and belief that sentences were too lenient when respondents were asked the second question (with its focus on leniency).  However, there was no relationship between political conservatism and the question of whether the courts dealt too harshly or not harshly enough with those being sentenced., Conclusion: These findings, taken in the context of other studies suggesting that expressions of harshness are often based on an inadequate understanding of alternative approaches to sentencing or inadequate information (e.g., Criminological Highlights 8(6)#1, 12(8)#5, 12(4)#3, 12(4)#5), suggest that harsh treatment of offenders is unlikely to make the public content with sentencing. Not only do members of the public not know about patterns of sentences (Criminological Highlights, 7(6)#4), their assessments of sentences, generally, depend on exactly what they are asked., Reference: Applegate, Brandon K, and Joseph B.

Many conditions of release on bail imposed on Canadian youths bear no relationship either to their alleged offences or to plausible concerns about those who remain in the community awaiting trial.,", Many Canadian youths, instead of being released by the police when they are arrested are detained in custody for a bail hearing.  Most of these youths are eventually released on conditions set by a judge or a justice of the peace.   Previous research (Criminological Highlights 12(5)#3) has shown that if the court imposes large numbers of conditions on youths released on bail and the case is not disposed of relatively quickly, the youth is likely to be charged with a new offence – “failure to comply with a court order.”  In Canada in 2011/12, 3508 youths (or 7.3% of the cases disposed of that year) had ‘failure to comply with a court order’ (most often related to conditions of bail) as the most serious offence in the case., This study examines the conditions that are imposed on youths in four Toronto-area courts.  Youths can be detained if it is thought that they would not appear in court when required or that they would commit a criminal offence that would threaten public safety.  The principle specified in Canadian bail laws is that, in general, the least onerous form of release is presumed to be appropriate unless the prosecutor can demonstrate to the court why a more onerous form of release is justified. The manner in which the law is written, then, implies that conditions should not be imposed on youths unless they can be shown to be necessary., This court observation study recorded the conditions imposed on youths, noting, as well, the information about the offence that was available to the presiding justice. More conditions were imposed on youths who had committed more serious offences and youths facing large numbers of charges. Many conditions showed no logical relationship to ensuring that the youth appeared in court as required and did not threaten public safety (the justification for conditions)., The most common conditions were that the youth should reside with the youth’s surety (76% of cases), “be amenable to the rules of the home” (84% of cases), not possess any weapons or a firearms acquisition certificate (79% of cases) and attend school (39% of cases).   31% of the youths were put under house arrest, and 30% were required to attend counselling., Conditions were then evaluated by the authors as having a “clear connection” or “no apparent connection” or an “ambiguous connection” with the concerns related to release.  Residing with one’s surety, for example, was seen as having an ambiguous relationship since its connection with reoffending and appearing in court is possible, but not clear. “Not communicating with the victim” (or co-accused) on the other hand, was always rated as having a ‘clear connection.’   Curfews, on the other hand, often had no apparent connection (e.g., when the offence didn’t take place during the curfew hours) but sometimes did.  Some conditions – such as attending school – almost never had a connection with concerns about bail.  None of the counselling orders had any relationship to the offence., In one rather ordinary case a youth had taken the contents of the pockets of another youth – 20 cents and some membership cards – at 11:15 in the morning  The youth was charged with robbery and released on bail with 8 separate conditions including attending counselling and house arrest (except when accompanied by mother or father to attend school or counselling)., Conclusion: In order to be released, youths consented to, or had imposed on them, an average of 9.3 separate conditions, the violation of any one of which could – and often did – result in additional criminal charges.  In other words, almost all of the conditions criminalized ordinary behaviour.  In the case referred to in the title of the article, a youth charged with shoplifting from one store in Ontario’s largest chain of drug stores was prohibited from entering this store and any of their other 622 stores in the province (but not, apparently, the stores of its competitors)., Reference: Myers, Nicole M. and Sunny Dhillon (2013).  The Criminal Offence of Entering Any Shoppers Drug Mart in Ontario: Criminalizing Ordinary Behaviour with Youth Bail Conditions.  Canadian Journal of Criminology & Criminal Justice, 55, 187-214., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV13N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-13-no-5-%E2%80%93-august-2013,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 13, No. 5 – August 2013",Regular Issue,2013
"People judge the legitimacy of the police by whether the police follow the law, whether the police have been procedurally fair in their dealings with citizens, the fairness of the outcome of encounters with the police, and the effectiveness of the police.  The perceived fairness of the police predicts voluntary cooperation with them.",", The willingness of citizens to volunteer information to the police about crime and disorder in their communities is seen generally as enabling the police to carry out their function (see, for example, Criminological Highlights 12(5)#2, 7(1)#4, 4(4)#1, 11(4)#1)., People may obey police either because they consider the police to be legitimate, or because they are afraid of the costs of non-obedience to the police. From the police perspective, it is clearly preferable if ordinary citizens believe in the legitimacy of the police and comply with them because they think it is the right thing to do rather than because they are afraid of being punished if they don’t. Previous research has suggested that “legality or lawfulness [is] the first and most basic level of legitimacy” (p. 108).  But in addition, procedural justice – that decisions within the rule of law should be impartial, consistent, and should allow citizens to “make representations of their side of the case before decisions are made” (p. 108) – is also seen as important., A survey of residents of London, England, was carried out in which people were asked questions related to police legitimacy. In addition, they were asked about their feelings of obligation to obey the police as well as their willingness to provide the police with information voluntarily.  It would appear that there are four separate, but somewhat related, aspects of police legitimacy: (1) Lawfulness:  assessed by questions including “When the police deal with people in my neighbourhood, they always behave according to the law”;  (2) Procedural fairness – e.g., “The police provide opportunities for unfair decisions to be corrected.” (3) Distributive fairness – e.g., “People usually receive the outcomes they deserve under the law”, and (4) Effectiveness – assessed by asking respondents how well the police address various kinds of crime., Voluntary cooperation with the police (e.g., by offering to provide them with information) appears to be related to some extent with feelings of obligation to obey the police. But in addition, high ratings of the police on lawfulness, procedural fairness and distributive fairness were also associated with the citizens’ willingness to voluntarily provide the police with crime-related information.  For people who had experienced a criminal victimization in the previous 12 months, those who believed the police were generally effective in dealing with crime were more likely to indicate they were willing to cooperate with the police. For non-victims, however, the opposite relationship was found.  It would appear that non-victims thought it was less important for them to voluntarily cooperate with the police if the police were, without their help, already doing a good job., Conclusion:  Belief in the legitimacy of the police (acting lawfully, procedural and distributive fairness) affected people’s willingness to cooperate voluntarily with the police. This effect was over and above the effect of any feelings that people had of legal obligation to help the police fight crime.  Though these factors are, generally, important, the various factors that determine cooperation with the police vary across groups in society.  Considering the population as a whole, then, cooperation with the police is likely to be highest if the police are seen as acting in a manner that is both lawful and fair., Reference: Tankebe, Justice (2013).

A survey of methodologically  rigorous studies of European correctional programs for youths  demonstrates that the same kinds of programs shown to be effective in North America are effective in Europe.,", Reviews of correctional programs generally show relatively consistent favourable effects “for cognitive behaviour treatment, structured therapeutic communities, and multimodal systems-oriented programs, whereas pure punishment, deterrence, and supervision-based interventions reveal either negligible or slightly negative outcomes” (p. 20)., In addition, there is empirical support for the “risk-need-responsivity” model of corrections which suggests that “treatment should correspond to the offenders’ risk level of reoffending, address their dynamic risk factors, and match their learning styles and capabilities…” (p. 20).   A concern, however, is that most of this work is North American in origin.  This paper, by looking at European studies, helps understand whether these findings generalize outside of the North American context., A systematic search for studies of the effectiveness of correctional treatment for adjudicated young people (under age 25) was carried out.  Programs designed to focus exclusively on specific populations (e.g., sex offenders, psychopaths) were excluded.  For a paper (published or unpublished in any language) to be included in the detailed analysis described here, it needed to report on a defined intervention that had some measure of offending (official or self-report) and it had to have a comparison group with an adequate demonstration of its equivalence to the treatment group., Although 14,001 separate studies were located (using a variety of search techniques), only 25 of these met the methodological criteria described above.  These 25 studies could be described as falling into 3 groups: cognitive-behavioural and behavioural treatment, intensive supervision and deterrence-based interventions, and non-behavioural treatment (e.g., job skills, mentoring, restorative justice, intensive probation support)., The studies that appeared to show favourable rehabilitative effects (better outcomes for the treatment group than the comparison group) were largely those reporting outcomes of “Behavioural/Cognitive-behavioural” programs.  The other types of programs did not show statistically reliable favourable outcomes. Programs were more likely to be effective if they took place in the community rather than in custody.  Both voluntary and obligatory programs were effective., Conclusion: The most effective programs appeared to be those that applied the ‘risk-need-responsivity’ model.  Assuming a recidivism rate for the control group of 50%, these programs would, on average, be expected to reduce it to 34%.  Other programs did not show overall significant reductions in recidivism.  “It is plausible that community programs show larger effects [than programs taking place in correctional institutions] because they contain more opportunities for real life application and transfer” (p. 36).  What is also notable about this study is the small number of methodologically adequate studies on this topic carried out in this part of the world and the large number of studies in which one could not reliably make judgments of program effectiveness., Reference: Koehler, Johann A., Friedrich Lösel, Thomas D.

Members of the public want those who commit offences during public disturbances to be punished more severely than ‘ordinary’ offenders – but not much more.,", Following riots in a number of English cities in August 2011, English criminal courts responded by handing down significantly harsher sentences to those whose offences related to the disturbances than they would have received for comparable offences committed under ordinary circumstances., Two justifications are offered for harsher sentences for offences that take place during large civil disturbances: (a) offences during disturbances may be seen by sentencing judges as more serious than the same behaviour during ordinary times, and (b) the perceived special need to decrease future crimes during riots by way of general deterrence., Data from a survey, carried out in England in March 2012 (about 7 months after the 2011 disturbances), show that only 17% of respondents saw offences during a riot as justifying a harsher sentence in all cases. Rather they generally want the circumstances to be considered by the judge.  An offence committed during a riot was seen as less deserving of an increased sentence than other offences with certain aggravating factors (e.g., a vulnerable victim, a victim chosen because of victim’s race, premeditation, or the offender having previous convictions)., In this survey, half of the respondents were asked about ‘ordinary’ crimes; the other half had essentially the same crime described (e.g., burglary from a shop) but they were asked, in addition, for their reactions to the offence if it had taken place during the previous summer’s riots.  Burglaries in the riot context were seen as more deserving of a prison sentence than an ordinary burglary.  One case in particular had received a lot of press coverage at trial and during the appeal in which the sentences were upheld; both the trial and appeal took place prior to the administration of the survey. This case involved defendants who were convicted and imprisoned for 4 years for inciting a riot by placing a notice on Facebook.  When asked about the sentence, 70% of the respondents indicated correctly that the offenders had been imprisoned, but only 17% of all respondents thought that the offenders had received prison sentences of 3 years or more.  Hence if the purpose of the unusually harsh sentence was to deter, then even in this case involving large amounts of publicity, the sentence was almost certainly ineffective in doing so since only a small minority of respondents knew about it., In general, the public wanted harsher sentences to be handed down for offences that took place in the context of a riot.   They saw these offences as more serious because of this context (even when the other facts of the case were held constant).   Although the English courts appear to have decided there should be a substantially more severe sentence imposed for offences that take place during a riot, members of “the public believe that a relatively modest uplift in severity is the appropriate response to a riot-related offence involving property” (p. 253)., Conclusion: English courts and the public both believe that sentences for riot-related property offences should be harsher than sentences for equivalent ordinary offences.  However, the public appears to be less enthusiastic than are judges about sentences that are considerably harsher than normal.  In addition, when those members of the public who prefer a custodial sentence were informed of the cost of such a sentence and asked whether they would be content with a strictly enforced and punitive non-custodial sentence (involving curfews, unpaid community service) for riot related behaviour – a sentence that would cost the taxpayer about one-third as much – 52% found this to be ‘definitely acceptable’ and an additional 34% found it to be ‘probably acceptable’.  The public’s desire for punishment for wrongdoing can be met in many cases with appropriate punitive community sanctions., Reference: Roberts, Julian V. and Mike Hough (2013).  Sentencing Riot-Related Offending: Where Do the Public Stand?  British Journal of Criminology, 53, 234-256., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV13N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-13-no-5-%E2%80%93-august-2013,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 13, No. 5 – August 2013",Regular Issue,2013
Prison guards in Norway use an informal system of favours and the withdrawal of those favours to control inmates’ behaviour.,"Informal social control of inmates in prisons – whether positive (e.g., selective favourable treatment of some inmates), or negative (e.g., physical abuse) – typically violates formal official regulations.  Prisons not only have rules about the use of punishments and rewards, but guards are expected to treat all prisoners equally.  Deviation from specified behaviours typically requires formal justification and some risk to the guard if the deviation is not seen as justified., In this study of the largest prison in Norway, the author, a part-time guard, took notes systematically about the manner in which order was maintained in the prison. The data, then, are based on his observations on how order was maintained, rather than on formal or informal interviews., Norwegian prisons, like most prison systems, have many formal rules covering almost all aspects of prisoners’ daily lives (e.g., number and lengths of visits and phone calls), details on meals, and details about most day-to-day operations.  Guards are expected to follow these rules.   At the same time, however, there are certain ‘privileges’ (a TV in one’s cell, social time with inmates) that are allowed and have become “part of the entitlement a prisoner expects” (p. 348).  For the guard, the goal of granting such privileges is simple: a peaceful period of time without difficulties or grievances from prisoners.   But in addition, there are possibilities of additional informal ‘privileges’ that can be granted to most prisoners without consequences to the guards., One way of accomplishing the goal of tranquility is through selective use of generosity in handing out these rewards to inmates.  For example, time on the telephone was a valued commodity since prisoners were allowed only a fixed number of minutes on the telephone.  Guards, then, could simply record fewer minutes than actually used, letting the inmate know that this was being done.  Such actions (e.g., recording a call as using 10 minutes rather than 18) occurred not to ‘reward’ prisoners for any particular behaviour, but instead as “an active contribution [to the inmate] given by guards” (p. 350) prior to any need for special control of the prisoner.   Creating the expectation for additional rewards – like additional telephone minutes – gave guards power to punish behaviour that they didn’t like.  This could be done informally and without negative consequences to guards simply by recording the actual number of minutes for the next call., Prisoners’ behaviour was often communicated by one shift to the next at a kind of briefing meeting between shifts. Guards on the upcoming shift might be told that a particular prisoner had been difficult. That was a signal that a ‘punishment’ such as not allowing a prisoner to socialize at the same time as the prisoner’s friend would be appropriate. This then would communicate guards’ displeasure with an inmate’s behaviour. Entitlements that were not required could, therefore, be withdrawn in order to maintain general discipline on the floor. Inmates, of course, cannot grieve the failure to receive rewards that are not required or which violate rules. One interesting consequence of using the withdrawing of ‘extra’ entitlements as a punishment is that they “must be distributed liberally and pre-emptively from the moment an inmate arrives… if the sanction is going to be realizable” (p. 353)., Conclusion: “By distributing favours liberally to inmates, the guards create a new and efficient system of punishment, which consists of withdrawal of rewards.  Since the removal of rewards is not a punishment in the official sense, it does not entail cumbersome institutional arrangements, such as hearings and reporting” (p. 360).  On the other hand, “The reward system … has to be kept hidden from the prison administration, which attempts to maintain supervision and disapproves of lasting informal relationships between guards and inmates.  No discriminatory informal treatment of inmates is officially permitted, but the reward system is easier to conceal than one based on punishments” (p. 360)., Reference: Ibsen, Alexander Z.

"Confessions made by people who did not commit the crime they confessed to are persuasive because these confessions are likely to contain references to specific details about the crime and victim, as well as the confessors’ thoughts and feelings about the crime.   False confessions, therefore, are often too good to be true.",", There is substantial evidence that “confessions are so powerful that once a suspect confesses, additional investigation often stops and the suspect is prosecuted and convicted” (p. 111). In addition, it would seem that jurors believe confessions even when evidence is presented raising serious doubts about their veracity. Essentially what seems to be happening is that those who hear a confession make a fundamental psychological error: they assume that nobody would make a confession that wasn’t true while simultaneously underestimating the situational pressures placed on the suspect by the police that lead to the confession., “Anecdotally, false confessions often seem credible despite a lack of corroboration because they contain not only admissions of guilt but also factual details, statements of voluntariness, statements about motivation, error corrections and other factors that interrogators are trained to include in taking a confession” (p. 113).  This study was designed to investigate what false confessions, generally, look like. Twenty false confessions (all the result of police interrogation) were examined.  Factual innocence was established either through DNA evidence (14 cases) or because the real perpetrator was found (2 cases) or because courts had determined that the confession was not accurate (4 cases). Nine of the 20 confessions were recorded electronically; the rest were transcribed by police. All 20 cases involved accusations of rape and/or murder., Crime details (e.g., the location and time of the offence, visual details, details of the victim’s behaviour) were included in all 20 false confessions.  Other details (e.g., victim’s mental state) were included less often.  Many details were graphic and specific.  For example, one suspect – subsequently exonerated by DNA evidence – provided gruesome details: “In the basement I found some scissors and some nails and I left the nails in his forehead. I used the brick to put some nails in the forehead” (p. 116)., “One of the most compelling tactics police officers are trained to use to demonstrate that a confession is both voluntary and reliable is the “error correction ploy” [suggested in a standard textbook for police on extracting confessions]… Investigators are advised to purposefully include in the written statement minor factual errors… that the suspect will presumably notice, correct, and initial…” (p. 117-8), the theory being that only the accused would have that information.   In this study, 44% of the written confessions had “corrected errors.”, A second study presented 141 students with trial scenarios containing one of 8 different confessions that varied along three dimensions: details were included (or not); motives for the crime were offered (or not), and an apology was offered by the suspect (or not). In addition, a no-confession condition was included.   The presence of any confession increased the students’ belief that the suspect was guilty.  Confessions with details of the crime increased participants’ beliefs that the accused committed the crime.  Statements about the motive and the apology tended to have the same effect., Conclusion: “Confessions are highly scripted statements… typically containing specific details about the crime, the victim, and the scene” (p. 118).  The fact that these are often “accurate details about the crime that were not in the public domain” (p. 118) makes it believable that the confessor is the culprit.   Presumably, details of this kind were purposefully or inadvertently given to those who make false confessions during the interrogation so that they could form part of the formal confession presented to the court.   These details, combined with the belief that nobody would succumb to offering a confession if it weren’t true, make false confessions very persuasive., Reference: Appleby, Sara C., Lisa E.

Women around the world are learning that it is not acceptable for men to assault their wives.,", In most western countries, it is fair to assume that most women do not think it is acceptable for men to assault their spouses if the woman does something that the man disapproves of.  The question addressed by this study is whether this view has spread to other parts of the world. “Rapid dissemination of global norms about violence against women began in the mid-1990s and accelerated in the first decade of the 2000s” (p. 241).  This study examines whether these western norms affected women’s views of spousal violence worldwide., Evidence that global attitudes are changing comes, first of all, from a survey of national policies.  “Since 1975, 119 different countries enacted approximately 260 national-level legal changes…. to address intimate partner violence” (p. 244), 95% of which occurred after the 1995 4th Conference on Women that was held in Beijing.  However, the fact that laws have changed does not necessarily mean that women’s attitudes have changed., This study examined changes in women’s views of intimate partner violence in 26 countries during the first decade of the 21st century.  Two surveys were carried out in each country – one in the first half of the first decade of this century and the other in the second half of the decade.  Half of the countries were in sub-Saharan Africa.  Other countries were scattered around the world and included Armenia, Cambodia, Egypt, India, Nepal, Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Turkey, among others. Sample sizes within each wave were all large, varying between 4,168 and 93,724 women., Though the questions varied a bit from country to country, the most common form of the question was “Sometimes a husband is annoyed or angered by things which his wife does. In your opinion, is a husband justified in hitting or beating his wife in the following situations…. (1) If she goes out without telling him; (2) if she neglects the children; (3) if she argues with him; (4) if she refuses to have sex with him; (5) if she burns the food.”, The main results are easy to describe: In 23 of the 26 countries, an increased proportion of women rejected the view that intimate partner violence is acceptable. The exceptions were Indonesia, Jordan, and Madagascar.  In a separate study of 15 countries in which men were asked similar questions, intimate partner violence was increasingly seen as unacceptable by men in 12 of these 15 countries (the exceptions being the Dominican Republic, Indonesia, and Madagascar). Controlling for other factors, in 22 of the 26 countries, urban women and more educated women were more likely to reject intimate partner violence. Surprisingly, however, “younger women were less likely than their elders to reject intimate partner violence” (261), though younger women, like older women, did change in the direction of rejecting the legitimacy of this kind of violence., Conclusion: One explanation for the findings – that there is a very consistent increase in the rejection of the legitimacy of intimate partner violence in a five year period - is that “diffusion of global cultural scripts about women’s rights, gender equality, and the ills of violence against women was an important macro-level factor that influenced national policymakers and people at the grassroots” (p. 260).  “The changes in attitudes about intimate partner violence occurred too rapidly to be explained by structural socioeconomic or demographic shifts” (p. 260).  During the first decade of the 20th century, “women [in most countries] of all ages became more likely to reject intimate partner violence” (p. 261)., Reference: Pierotti, Rachel S.  (2013).

"When men violate a condition of parole, requiring them to attend a “day reporting centre” appears to be no better – and may be worse – than simply allowing them to continue in the community on ordinary parole.",", Many of those who are in prisons in the US and Canada are there because they have violated a condition of parole (or other form of conditional release from prison).   In order to provide an intermediate response to these violations, the ‘day reporting centre’ was developed.  The idea, obviously, was that if the parolee was engaged in useful, supervised, activities during the day, but returned home at night, costs could be reduced and outcomes, perhaps, improved., Previous research has demonstrated, not surprisingly, that day reporting centres are less expensive than re-incarcerating the parole violator, but the effects on recidivism are inconsistent.  However, that line of research leaves unanswered another question: Are day reporting centres any better than simply allowing parolees who have violated a condition of their release to continue on ordinary parole (perhaps with some modifications of his conditions of release)?  This study compares rates of reoffending for parole violators required to attend a day reporting centre to the offending rates of those allowed to continue on ordinary parole. Most importantly, it uses a randomized experimental design in which 355 men were randomly assigned to receive one or the other of these two conditions., If a parolee violated one or more conditions of release in the early stages of parole supervision, he was randomly assigned either to attend a day reporting centre (7 centres participated in the experiment) or to continue on ordinary parole.  Both groups of offenders were required to attend various treatment programs, though the study was not able to determine exactly which programs the offenders received or the efficacy of individual programs.  The focus, instead, was on whether the additional control afforded by the day reporting centre was cost effective in reducing subsequent crime., During the study period (the 90 days in which the parolees were required to attend the day reporting centre or were continued on ordinary parole),  there was no difference between the two groups in the recorded number of offences or violations of conditions of release.  About half of both groups completed this period without any incidents.  However, of those who did not complete this phase successfully, the day reporting group was more likely to be arrested for a new offence and the ordinary parolees were more likely to be found to have violated a condition of parole.  In the longer term (either 6 or 18 months after the assignment to condition) there were no differences in overall arrest rates, but those assigned to the day reporting centre were more likely to have been convicted of an offence during the first 6 months.   The results suggest, therefore, “that something about the day reporting centre experience creates an environment that is conducive to an increase in …. arrests for new offences during program participation and convictions for new offences in the short term” (p. 135)., Conclusion:  It would appear that simply restricting the movements of those on parole during the first 90 days after they have violated a condition of release is no more effective than allowing them to continue ordinary parole (perhaps with modified conditions) and may be worse.  There was no evidence that the actual programs that were available to parolees in the two locations differed in their effectiveness. Ninety days spent in a slightly different setting, then, did not appear to have any beneficial impacts and may have had harmful effects.   Given that the costs of day reporting centres are higher than ordinary parole, the results of this study suggest that it is more cost effective to spend money  on programs that could be shown to be effective., Reference: Boyle, Douglas, J., Laura M.

Women involved in corporate fraud typically are less central to these crimes than are men.,", Previous research has shown that the involvement of women in corporate fraud is relatively rare. In one study of significant organizational or corporate frauds, only 14% of the offenders were women.  One reason for this, of course, is that women are considerably less likely than men to be in a position in a company to carry out crimes of this kind., This study looks at major indictments from the US Corporate Fraud Task Force, covering 83 cases involving 436 offenders (9% of whom were women) that occurred between 2002 and 2009.  The goal of the study was to understand the role and position of women in these offences, compared to men.  76% of the offences involved more than one person, but none of the single-offender cases involved women. Furthermore, there were no ‘group’ crimes involving just women., Many more men (71%) than women (38%) in the all-men and mixed-sex offender groups had top or high level positions in the companies. Only 3 of the 37 indicted women (8%) were identified as the ringleaders of the crime, compared to 39% of the men who were indicted.  51% of the women who were indicted were seen as having had minor roles in the offences whereas only 6% of the indicted men had minor roles.  17% of the women who were indicted were thought to have individually profited with more than half a million dollars. More than twice as many men (38%) involved in these crimes were thought to have reaped profits of at least this much.   A multivariate analysis suggests that the reason women’s profits from the crimes were so much lower is that they had less important roles in the crimes., About 30% of the women involved in these offences had some relationship (spouse, partner, loyal assistant) to a major (male) player in the offence.  Not surprisingly, given that the women involved in these crimes tended not to be high ranking officials in the companies, many (68%) had job responsibilities that were instrumental to carrying out the offence.  Females who were indicted as a result of investigations by this Task Force tended to be more likely than men to be following directions of others rather than acting proactively., The women who were indicted, then, “were unduly vulnerable to indictment and prosecution not so much because of their culpability or real contribution to the conspiracy, but instead because of their utility: they were in mid-level, easily monitored, positions in which they collected and reported financial data that, in turn, made them useful tools for the prosecution to gain evidence and turn state’s witness against co-conspirators” (p. 470)., Conclusion:  Although women are sometimes involved in corporate crime, it appears their involvement in crime tends – like their involvement in corporations – to be at a lower level than that of men.  And like women’s incomes, they profit less from corporate crime than do men.  Men, it would seem, are more likely to direct both the operation of America’s corporations and the criminal conspiracies that these corporations are involved in.   The pigs at the front of the corporate trough, then, aren’t likely to be sows., Reference: Steffensmeier, Darrell J., Jennifer Schwartz, and Michael Roche (2013).  Gender and Twenty-First-Century Corporate Crime:  Female Involvement and the Gender Gap in Enron-Era Corporate Frauds.  American Sociological Review, 78 (3), 448-476., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV13N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-13-no-6-%E2%80%93-november-2013,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 13, No. 6 – November 2013",Regular Issue,2013
"Although children of Swedish immigrants and children who immigrated to Sweden with their parents tend, as young adults, to be more likely than native born Swedes to be involved in crime, much of this difference relates to socio-economic conditions as well as differences in the neighbourhoods in which they live.",", Research carried out in the US (see Criminological Highlights 8(3)#5, 8(6)#5,  10(6)#7,  11(1)#4, 13(6)#7) and Canada (Criminological Highlights 11(2)#1) tends to show that immigrants, and neighbourhoods with large proportions of immigrants, have lower levels of crime.  Detailed studies in Europe, however, suggest that the findings may be more complicated in that there may be complex interactions involving the country of origin and generation (Criminological Highlights 8(3)5)., This study examines the official involvement in crime (from age 15 to approximately 30) of childhood immigrants (those who immigrated before age 12) and children of immigrants – those born in the host country, Sweden – in comparison to children of native born Swedes.  In Sweden, previous research has shown that immigrants are more likely than native born Swedes to be involved in crime., This study examines the criminal justice involvement in crime overall and in violent crime. Various measures were used including whether the person was suspected by the police of involvement in crime, but not necessarily charged (thought to be equivalent to measures, in US studies, of arrests by police),  those convicted of crimes (or violent crimes), and those incarcerated. The involvement (if any) in crime of a sample of 66,330 people who completed their final year of compulsory education (Grade 9) between 1990 and 1993 was examined for 12-15 years., Parental resources were measured with a number of different variables related to the youth’s situation before age 15.  These included family structure (single or two parent family), number of children, parents’ education and the nature of parents’ employment.  In addition, the youth’s neighbourhood was controlled for by statistically comparing the two immigrant groups to native born Swedes who grew up in the same neighbourhood., In comparison to native born males of Swedish parents, male children of immigrants (the children, but not the parents, were born in Sweden) were about 40% more likely to be suspected of offences; and childhood immigrants (those born abroad) were about 55% more likely to be suspected of crimes.  For females, the comparable figures were 40% and 74%, respectively. The figures for convictions and incarceration were relatively similar: children of immigrants and immigrant children, both males and females, were over-represented among those convicted and incarcerated.  All of these figures are similar to figures on the higher involvement in crime in Sweden of adult immigrants., However, when controls for parental resources and neighbourhood were introduced as controls, the differences between the two groups of immigrant children and native born Swedes decreased dramatically.  For example, looking at convictions, before controls for parental resources and neighbourhood were introduced, male children of immigrants were 38% more likely to be convicted than native born Swedes.  When the social background controls were introduced, this difference was only 15%, and when social background and neighbourhood controls were entered, the difference was only 11%.  For females, children of immigrants were 25% more likely to be convicted of any crime.  When controls for parental resources and neighbourhood were introduced, the difference between the two groups disappeared completely.  The results for violent crime were similar., Conclusion: Although children of immigrants and immigrant children in Sweden are more involved in crime than native born Swedes, most (or in some cases all) of this difference disappears when parental resources and characteristics of the neighbourhood are controlled for. The observed difference in crime between these two groups of immigrants on the one hand,  and native born Swedes on the other, seems to be explained, in large part, by socio-economic factors known, in many studies, to be associated with involvement in crime., Reference:  Hällsten, Martin, Ryszard Szulkin, and Jerzy Sarnecki (2013).

US cities with high concentrations of immigrants tend to have lower violent crime rates than cities with few immigrants.  This is particularly true in cities in which immigrants are integrated into the political structure of the city.,", Various studies have found that – in the US – the more immigrants there are in a city or neighbourhood, the lower the violent crime rate (Criminological Highlights 8(3)#5, 8(6)#5,  10(6)#7,  11(1)#4).  However, the manner in which immigrants are welcomed into cities varies.  This study examines whether the relationship of immigration to crime may vary depending on how receptive the city is to the concerns of immigrant groups., It is suggested that cities that are politically receptive to immigrant concerns can engender trust in the political system, encouraging immigrants not only to become engaged in the political process, but also to become more attached to and integrated into their neighbourhoods. Various indicators of favourable immigrant opportunities were examined. The concentration of Latino and Asian Americans in municipal elected offices (corrected for their concentration in the city) was one such indicator.  The number of Black, Hispanic, and Asian police officers was another.  Some cities had policies not to look for violations of immigration laws.  General support for pro-immigrant and liberal causes was estimated by examining the presidential voting records in the 2000 election (Bush vs. Gore)., Data on robberies and homicides taking place between 1999 and 2001 in 8,931 census tracts in 87 US cities with populations in excess of 100,000 were the focus of the study., Overall, higher levels of immigration were associated with lower rates of homicides and robberies. However, this was not true for all cities.  In some cities, higher immigrant concentrations were associated with somewhat higher rates of violence., In general, the negative association between immigrant concentration and homicide across census tracts (more immigrants, less crime) is greater when the city appears to have a more pro-immigrant culture (e.g., higher rates of immigrants in elected offices, a more diverse police force).  Furthermore, “Democratic support enhances the inverse relationship between immigration and homicide” (p. 617).  The overall pattern of the data on robbery is quite similar, though, in general, not as likely to be statistically significant as the data on homicide., Conclusion: “Rather than destabilizing communities and contributing to social disorder, [the data show that census tract level] immigration concentration was inversely associated with neighbourhood homicide and robbery.”  Furthermore, “Cities with immigrant political opportunities enhance the protective association between neighbourhood immigration concentration and violence” (p. 621-2).  It would appear that  “Favourable immigrant political opportunities reinforce social organization within immigrant neighbourhoods by enhancing the trust immigrants place in civic processes and immigrants’ capacity to exert public social control” (p. 622)., Reference: Lyons, Christopher J., María B.

The crime reducing effects of marriage on men and women last only as long as the marriage.,", There is a substantial amount of evidence that when those who have been arrested get married, their likelihood of offending decreases.  Though the effect seems to be robust, the explanations for it are not clear., Two general classes of explanations for the reduction in criminal activity that follows marriage are the following: (1) Marriage creates or reflects an enduring change where people’s identity (as offenders) changes and new attachments are created; and (2) Marriage changes an offender’s life in that they are involved in different activities and, because of their spouses, simply don’t have the opportunities for involvement in crime that they had when single. The former explanation implies an enduring change in the person such that the effects of marriage should be evident even if the marriage breaks down.  The latter suggests a more situational mechanism such that offending rates should go up if the marriage ends., This study used data from a longitudinal study of 2,838 American males and females who were first interviewed in their mid-teens and then followed for 13 years.  For this study, only those who had been arrested at least once were studied.  Various other factors were controlled statistically in the analyses. These included race, household size, family structure, economic disadvantage, etc. Because the sample was interviewed annually, it was possible to determine not only whether there were differences across individuals (e.g., between those who were married and those who were not; and if they were ever married whether they were divorced) but also whether, within individual, the rate of offending changed when the person married or divorced., Looking at the whole sample (which included only those who had been arrested at least once), it appears that marriage and divorce have important impacts on criminal activity.  Those whose histories included a marriage had fewer arrests than those who were not married.  More interesting was the fact that for those who got married, there was a decrease in arrests after the marriage.  The effect of divorce was examined (separately for males and females) for those who not only had been arrested at least once, but who also had been married.   For both men and women, those who were divorced showed increased numbers of arrests.  Taking advantage of the fact that the study used longitudinal data on the 813 men and women who had married, it was shown that if a person got divorced, arrests went up for both men and women., For short marriages (23 months or less) the effects of a divorce were negligible.  For longer marriages, however, divorces (and legal separations) increased the likelihood of an arrest considerably. Furthermore, “the detrimental effect of divorce is likely not a temporary outcome of the immediate turmoil associated with getting divorced, but instead it seems to maintain over time” (p.424)., Conclusion: The evidence suggests that the effect of marriage on those who have been arrested is contingent upon the marriage not ending in divorce.  Although both men and women with a history of arrests are likely to reduce their offending rates when they marry, divorce is likely to lead to increased offending.  It would appear, therefore, that the effects of marriage are more likely to be situational than to reflect an enduring change.  Marriage may reduce the likelihood that a person continues to engage in crime, but only as long as the couple stays married., Reference: Bersani, Diana and Elaine Eggleston Doherty (2013).  When the Ties That Bind Unwind: Examining the Enduring and Situational Processes of Change Behind the Marriage Effect.  Criminology, 51 (2), 399-433., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV13N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-13-no-6-%E2%80%93-november-2013,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 13, No. 6 – November 2013",Regular Issue,2013
Increasing the size of fines handed down for drinking-driving offences will not reduce re-offending.,"Fines are a relatively common sanction in criminal courts.  In Canada, fines are imposed almost as often as prison sentences. For criminal code driving offences (the impaired driving offences, dangerous driving offences, etc.) fines are imposed in Canada about five times as frequently as imprisonment.  For impaired driving offences, there are almost 10 times as many fines imposed as prison sentences.  More generally – for less serious offences and in other countries – fines are a very common penalty., Previous research has suggested that the imposition of mandatory minimum fines has not had a measurable general deterrent impact. In other words, mandatory minimum fines are no more likely to keep people from committing drinking-driving offences than penalties set by judges in which the judge has discretion on the size of the fine.  But there is less research on the effect of fines of different amounts on the likelihood that those who receive the fine will reoffend.   However, other research would suggest that the size of the penalty an offender receives has no deterrent effect on the likelihood that the offender will reoffend (see Criminological Highlights, 11(4)#2, 11(1)#1, 11(1)#2)., This study examined the subsequent drink-driving offending of all of those charged with driving with blood-alcohol concentrations above the legal limit in New South Wales, Australia in 2003 and 2004.   The study takes advantage of the fact that there is substantial variability in the fines handed down by different magistrates.  Various controls were introduced related to the offender (age, sex, prior record of a drinking-driving offence) and the offence (urban or non-urban setting, blood alcohol content, plea, whether the offender was represented by counsel)., Looking at the likelihood of a subsequent drinking-driving offence within three years, the results show that males, those with more serious original drinking-driving offences, those who faced their original charge without lawyers, and those with previous convictions for drinking driving offences, had a higher likelihood of reconviction.   However, there was no indication of an impact of the size of the fine that was handed down on the likelihood of reoffending within three years., Overall, almost 10% of the 12,658 offenders reoffended.  There was a good deal of variation in the fines handed down when they were convicted.  The lowest 25% of the fines were $400 or less.  The top quarter of the fines exceeded $800.   Thus the conditions for an adequate test of the specific deterrent impact of the fine were met.  Hence, had there been even a small deterrent impact of the size of the fine, an effect would have shown up., Conclusion:  Since the size of the fine appears to have no impact on the likelihood that a drinking driver will re-offend, it is reasonable to ask why this might be the case.  One possibility, of course, is that the perceived likelihood of apprehension may be too low.  Australian governments, aware of this problem, spend a good bit of effort on random breath testing and advertising campaigns designed to emphasize the risks in drinking and driving. “The perceived risk of apprehension, however, may be more dependent on the number of times a driver has been stopped by police while intoxicated or after drinking than on the publicity surrounding random breath testing, or the total number of times he or she has been stopped by the police or the number of times police have been seen performing random breath tests on other people” (p. 799).   What is clear, however, from this study and others is that raising the penalty size is not going to reduce this type of reoffending., Reference: Moffatt, Steve and Don Weatherburn (2011).  The Specific Deterrent Effect of Higher Fines on Drink-Driving Offenders.  British Journal of Criminology, 51, 789-803., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV12N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-12-no-4-%E2%80%93-march-2012,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 12, No. 4 – March 2012",Regular Issue,2012
The behaviour of young offenders in custodial institutions is not a good predictor of their offending after they are released.,", It is understandable to assume that institutional misconduct by incarcerated young offenders predicts reoffending when these youths are released.  The theory is a simple one: if a youth can’t behave well in a custodial institution, then the youth must be out of control and is likely to offend when released.  Institutional behaviour, then, is often used in various decisions about the youth’s future such as whether it is safe to release the youth into the community., This study followed 1,804 violent male delinquents released from a large US juvenile correctional institution between 1987 and 2004.  These were very serious offenders: almost a quarter were incarcerated for a homicide or attempted murder and the rest were in custody for serious violent offences.  In this jurisdiction, these youths were eligible for ‘blended’ sentences, initially served (until age 18) in a youth facility.  At age 18, a hearing was held at which time the youth could be released (perhaps on parole), held until age 21, or transferred to an adult facility.  The study followed those who were not transferred to the adult facility for an average of about 5.7 years, and looked at re-arrests during this period., Six different measures of institutional conduct (expressed as rates per year incarcerated) were used to predict re-arrest: assaults on staff or on other youths, possession of a weapon, gang activity, staff reports that the youth was a danger to others, and total misconducts (which was largely made up of less serious types of misconduct).  Various other forms of controls were used:  race, age at release, time served, previous delinquencies, commitment offence, previous substance abuse, and whether the youth was supervised on parole on release., Looking first at those youths (n=1433) who were followed for at least three years, none of the measures of institutional conduct predicted either of the two outcome measures: re-arrest for any offence and re-arrest for a felony.  When ‘rate of re-arrest’ (for any offence) was examined, there was a very small, but statistically significant, effect of ‘total misconduct.’  When the size of this effect was compared to the predictive effects of the other known factors (e.g., race, whether there was a history of substance abuse, previous criminal record, and whether he had a history of involvement with gangs) the added impact of total institutional conduct was minor., Conclusion:  In this study “a variety of indicators of misconduct offered little explanation of post-release reoffending for this specific group of serious and violent male delinquents” (p. 722).   It may be that if one does not control for other factors (e.g. criminal record and personal characteristics of the youth), institutional behaviour might have a larger predictive value. But the findings clearly demonstrate that the best predictors of future offending for these youths (who had committed serious violent offences) were characteristics that they entered the institution with. But even these predictors are far from perfect.  This study simply demonstrates that ‘institutional behaviour’ adds little to our ability to predict future offending.   The fact that institutional behaviour is more recent – and more salient and intuitive to those making decisions – does not make it predictive of behaviour outside the institution., Reference: Trulson, Chad R., Matt DeLisi, and James W.

Residents of England and Wales want judges to have discretion in the sentencing of murderers.,", In England and Wales (referred to hereafter as England), as in Canada, judges typically have a good deal of discretion in the sentencing of offenders.  The exception in both England and Canada is murder for which the mandatory sentence of life in prison is the only legal sentence.  The argument has been made that anything less than a life sentence would undermine public confidence., Simplistic public opinion polls have suggested that the public would prefer life without parole or the death penalty for murder, even though there are strong arguments against its use (see Criminological Highlights 9(1)#7).  When asked, in 2007, which penalty they preferred for someone who killed a stranger 34% preferred the death penalty, 44% preferred life without parole, and only 19% preferred ‘a long prison sentence with a chance of parole.’  As has been shown previously in a study of life without parole for youths, those favouring life without parole may be doing so because they don’t think about possible alternative sentences (see Criminological Highlights 12(2)#3)., This paper examines public knowledge of sentencing for murder and explores whether, for 1027 respondents to a 2010 survey, life sentences are truly the preferred option. Most respondents were unaware of the fact that homicide rates in England had decreased somewhat in the previous decade.  64% of respondents thought, incorrectly, that the rate had increased.  48% of respondents were reasonably accurate on how long murderers actually spend in prison, but 42% underestimated the actual time whereas only 10% overestimated the actual time spent in prison.  In focus groups, it became clear that people knew that a ‘life sentence’ didn’t mean life without the possibility of release, but they didn’t have a clear idea what a ‘life sentence’ meant. When asked to estimate the percentage of  life prisoners who had been released to the community  and were subsequently returned to prison for an offence (the actual percent is about 2%), 74% of the respondents thought that the correct answer was 10% or more.  Only 9% were unsure and didn’t venture a guess and 17% guessed  5% or less., Respondents were given 10 specific scenarios describing actual cases in which people were convicted of murder.  They were then asked which of 5 alternatives they would prefer as the sentence: up to 9 years in prison, 10-19 years in prison,  20-29 years in prison, 30 years or more in prison with release at some stage, or imprisonment for the offender’s natural life.  There was huge variation in  preferences across the descriptions of the different murders.   For example, for the most severe alternative (imprisonment for life without release), the percent favouring this alternative ranged from 4% to 52% with an average, across scenarios, of 26%.   In other words, for all but one scenario, most respondents favoured a sentence with a definite ending.   But equally importantly, their preferences for the length of murder sentences varied considerably with the facts of the case., Over 80% of respondents thought that sentences (or sentences in murder cases) were too lenient, with at least half of these indicating that sentencing was much too lenient.   Those who were less well informed about the facts related to homicide in England were more critical of sentencing in general, and were more punitive in their preferred sentences in the murder scenarios., Conclusion:  When asked general questions, people say that they favour life without parole (or death) sentences for murder, but when asked about actual cases, they opt for less severe sentences and, more importantly, their preferred sentences reflect the specific facts of the case.  Mandatory ‘life sentences’ are preferred in some cases, but not in others.   A sentencing scheme for murder that reflected the values of a public informed about the cases and the alternatives that are possible would, then, be much more flexible than the current structure that exists in England and in Canada., Reference: Mitchell, Barry and Julian V.

The number of people in American state and federal prisons declined in 2010 for the first time since 1972. The reduction occurred as a result of a variety of changes in state policies.,", At a time when Canada has been implementing policies designed to increase the prison population, the US – the unrivalled world leader in imprisonment rates – has been decreasing its imprisonment rate.  Part of the motivation to decrease imprisonment appears to be fiscal concerns.  In other instances, courts, not legislatures, made the decision that reduction of imprisonment is necessary because of overcrowding.  California, for example, was ordered by the US Supreme Court to reduce its inmate population by about 46,000 inmates, a reduction that is about 30% larger than the total Canadian prison population.  (California’s resident population is 9% larger than Canada’s.) The mechanisms for change, however, appear to be quite varied across states., The most obvious way for states to reduce the use of imprisonment is through changes at the ‘front door” – in sentencing policies.   What is most notable about the sentence reduction changes that have been made is that they appear to have two major targets.  In the first place, imprisonment of drug offenders has been targeted.  A number of states have either eliminated or further limited the requirement of imprisonment for certain drug offences (e.g., in Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio).  Some have reduced the use of imprisonment for drug offences by increasing the availability of drug courts (e.g., in Florida, Idaho)., Alternatively, states have reduced imprisonment less visibly by changes at the ‘back door’ – by allowing prisoners to be released earlier or by making parole more available or easier to obtain. This has occurred in Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and West Virginia. In Louisiana, for example, prisoners over 60 and who have served 10 years in prison can be released early, if they are low risk. Similarly, severely ill prisoners in Rhode Island can be given medical parole., A third way of reducing imprisonment is by limiting the ‘re-entry’ of those serving sentences in the community who violate the conditions of their community sanction (e.g., probation) or violate conditions of release (parole).  Changes allowing non-prison responses to these ‘technical violations’ have occurred in Alabama, Louisiana, Maryland, and North Carolina. In South Dakota the problem of parole violations was addressed by allowing early discharge from parole for certain prisoners.  In Texas, the problem of the imprisonment of those committing technical violations while being supervised was addressed by allowing for a reduction in the period of community supervision and by giving financial incentives to counties if they reduce the number of probationers who are returned to prison., There have also been a number of attempts to reduce the collateral consequences of imprisonment such as allowing records of certain offences to be expunged (Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Oregon) and eliminating certain statutory exclusions of offenders from rights such as voting,  accessibility of welfare programs, or employment (Delaware, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, Utah)., Conclusion: What is important about the changes that took place in 2011 to reduce imprisonment in the US is that they are varied and widespread.  They are not concentrated in any one region or in states with a particular political orientation.  They are broad, but largely they target specific types of offenders.  Furthermore, they seem to be more likely to target release from prison and to limit re-incarceration for technical violations than they are to address the sentencing policies that landed the offender in prison in the first place., Reference: Porter, Nicole (2012).  The State of Sentencing, 2011.  The Sentencing Project.

People who live in relatively punitive jurisdictions are not more likely to be confident that sentences are harsh enough.,", In many countries (e.g., England and Canada) a substantial majority of the public thinks that sentences are too lenient.  In Australia, 12 separate surveys carried out between 1984 and 2007 showed that between 70% and 85% of Australians believe that harsher sentences should be handed down in criminal courts.  The suggestion, from political leaders who favour high imprisonment, is that people would have confidence in the courts and in sentences if sentences were more punitive., The problem with this assertion is that it assumes the view people hold about the appropriateness of sentences imposed in their jurisdictions is the result of a careful assessment of sentences actually handed down. This is almost always not the case, in part because the data for such an assessment is typically not available to ordinary citizens. No ordinary citizen examines court sentences systematically and then makes a reasoned decision that they are too harsh, too lenient, or just right., This study examines a fairly simple question: are people in those locations in Australia that are most punitive (measured by imprisonment rates) likely to express confidence with sentencing?  Australia has 8 separate states and territories (each with its own criminal law).  There is considerable variation in imprisonment rates: the most punitive four jurisdictions have imprisonment rates that are, on average, more than twice that of the average of the four least punitive jurisdictions., In a survey that took place in all 8 jurisdictions, people were asked 7 questions designed to measure each individual’s confidence in sentencing.  Seven other questions measured the respondent’s desire for more punitive sentencing.  Not surprisingly, those who had the lowest confidence in sentencing were most likely to desire harsher sentences., Although there was, as noted above, a fair amount of variation in actual punitiveness (as measured by the rate of imprisonment), there was little variation in the average confidence in sentencing or in people’s desire for harsher sentences. However, some of the states/territories did differ from one another on these attitude measures., Most important is the finding that there is a “lack of concordance between the public attitude measures and imprisonment rates across jurisdictions” (p. 379).  Said differently people were not more confident in the sentences that were handed down in their jurisdictions when they lived in a punitive state or territory.  Similarly, people were not less likely to desire harsher sentences than those currently imposed when they lived in a state in which relatively harsh sentences were already handed down., Conclusion:  “Wide differences in sentencing practice [across states and territories in Australia] and political activity on sentencing are not linked to any major differences in public attitudes between jurisdictions” (p. 381).   People living in those states with the lowest imprisonment rates are no more likely than people living in states with high imprisonment rates to hold punitive attitudes or lack confidence in the sentencing system.  In other words, beliefs about sentencing and beliefs about the courts appear to be independent of what is actually happening in the courts., Reference: Roberts, Lynne D., Caroline Spiranovic, and David Indermaur (2011).  A Country Not Divided: A Comparison of Public Punitiveness and Confidence in Sentencing Across Australia.  Australian & New Zealand Journal of Criminology, 44(3), 370-386., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV12N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-12-no-4-%E2%80%93-march-2012,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 12, No. 4 – March 2012",Regular Issue,2012
Seventy-two studies demonstrate that the accuracy of the identification of suspects can be improved if police present eyewitnesses with lineups sequentially rather than simultaneously.,", For many decades, it has been known that a frequent cause of wrongful convictions is mistaken eyewitness identification of the offender by a well-meaning witness.  (Criminological Highlights 12(1)#3). The ‘simultaneous lineup’ in which the suspect (or a picture of the suspect) is shown to an eyewitness along with a number of other people or pictures is the standard approach most police services use in conducting a lineup., Since the number of wrongful convictions is not trivial (Criminological Highlights 9(4)#5, 4(1)#6, 7(5)#5), the challenge is to find an approach for identifying offenders that has fewer errors.   The difficulty with the standard simultaneous lineup in which a person sees the suspect along with a number of other people is that there is a tendency for eyewitnesses to identify the person who most closely resembles the offender, rather than to make a judgement that the suspect is the offender., The solution to this problem in the identification process has been known for some time: the witness should be shown pictures (or live people) sequentially – one at a time – rather than simultaneously (all pictures or people at once).  The eyewitness is shown a single picture (or a person) and decides if he or she is the culprit.  Then the witness is shown the next person or picture and indicates whether  that person is the culprit. Typically the witness does not know how many pictures (or people) are to be presented.  Ideally – in any identification procedure – the person administering the procedure should not know who the suspect is so that unconscious cues cannot be communicated to the eyewitness., This study brings together the research that compares the accuracy rate of simultaneous lineups and sequential lineups.  Seventy-two separate experiments were located.  Obviously these studies varied in a number of different ways.   Twenty-seven of the studies used a ‘full design’ in which simultaneous and sequential lineups were compared, in which, for some witnesses,  the culprit was present and for some the culprit was not.  That way the accuracy can be estimated more  precisely since the researchers can see whether, in the ‘culprit absent’ lineups, the witness correctly indicated that nobody in the lineup was the culprit., Overall, the results are straightforward: sequential lineups are more accurate in identifying the true culprit.  However, the detailed results are a bit more complex.  ‘Choosing rates’ are higher in the simultaneous lineups than in the sequential, perhaps because guessing is implicitly encouraged.  The result of this higher tendency to pick someone, results in the culprit being more likely to be chosen in the simultaneous lineup.   But the advantage of the sequential lineup can be seen very clearly in the cases in which the culprit was absent:  eyewitnesses subjected to this procedure were much more likely to identify nobody (the correct decision) than in the simultaneous lineup., Conclusion: The standard in most police departments seems to be the simultaneous lineups.  These data suggest very strongly that, in comparison with a sequential presentation of the lineup, the simultaneous lineup is much more likely to result in a mistaken identification of an innocent person.   The reluctance of police departments to change may be the result of the other finding: an estimated 8% drop in culprit identifications in the sequential lineup.  There are, however, a number of police departments in the US that use sequential lineups apparently without difficulty.  These departments appear to understand that ultimately their goal should be to use the most accurate test that is available., Reference: Steblay, Nancy K, Jennifer E.

It should not be assumed that users of child pornography either have committed ‘contact’ sexual offences in the past or are likely to do so in the future.,", There is understandable concern that ‘online’ child pornography offenders (those whose offence involves possession or viewing of child pornography on their computers) have committed or will commit sexual offences with children involving actual physical contact with their victims. In addition, of course, there are other concerns about child pornography:  the demand for child pornography encourages the exploitation of children to meet this demand, and its mere existence offends community standards and values., This paper looks at the users of child pornography and asks two questions: (a) Are ‘online offenders’ likely to have committed offences in the past? (b) After being apprehended for an online child pornography offence, are ‘online’ child pornography offenders likely to commit further offences?   These are important questions because the answers to them are likely to be helpful in shaping policies related to society’s responses to online child pornography offenders., The study identified 24 studies that examined the criminal histories of online offenders. One important finding from these studies is that there is substantial variation in the rates of previous offending.  Not surprisingly, when one looks at a sample of those who are arrested, the rates are lower than they are for those who are identified because they are in a correctional institution.  And both of these are lower than rates for those referred for clinical treatment.  These differences are “probably the result of contact offence history having an effect on whether someone is incarcerated [or]… being referred for assessment or treatment” (p. 125).   In addition, those who are incarcerated and in treatment programs are often encouraged to admit to offences [even if they did not take place exactly as stated], since admitting to prior offences is sometimes seen by clinicians as a sign of progress in treatment., Looking at the percent who had previously been charged or convicted of any contact sexual offence, the range was from 0% in one study to 43%.   When official records are examined (for 4,464 online offenders), 12.2% had prior contact sex offences. Looking at all records (including self reports), 17.3% had reports of prior contact sex offences.  For the (largely) clinical sample, using self reports, about 55% reported prior sexual contact with children., The recidivism data are a bit more complicated, in part because the followup periods varied (from 1.5 years to 6 years, with most periods under 4 years).  Looking at the recidivism of 1,247 online offenders, 2% reoffended with a contact sexual offence and 3.4% recidivated with another child pornography offence.  Information about (non-sexual) violence recidivism was available for 983 online offenders.  The rate was 4.2%.  The relatively low rate of recidivism is consistent with other studies of sex offence recidivism (Criminological Highlights 6(6)#8, 5(1)#4, 3(3)#3, 6(3)#3, 9(2)#5)., Conclusion: It is almost certain that the arrest or charge data under-estimate the involvement in contact sex offences.  The self report measures suggest that up to about half of online sex offenders may have committed contact sex offences in the past.  But whatever measure one looks at, it appears that “there is a distinct group of online offenders whose only sexual crimes involve illegal (most often child) pornography or, less frequently, illegal solicitations of minors using the Internet” (p. 136).  But it is also true that “online offenders rarely go on to commit detected sexual offences” (p. 136) and “pedophilic interests do not necessarily result in contact sexual offences against children” (p. 140).  Initial research evidence “suggests that the same risk factors matter for online or offline [contact] sexual offending” (p. 137).  Policies, therefore, should reflect the fact that online offenders do not constitute a homogeneous group of offenders., Reference:  Seto, Michael, R.

"Although transitional job training programs for people leaving prisons have not, overall, been very successful in reducing reoffending, successfully completing these job programs may serve as a signal that the offender has chosen to stop offending and become part of the ordinary workforce.",", A number of meta-analyses of noncustodial employment programs for people with a history of offending have resulted in rather disappointing results.  The safest overall conclusion would be that they do not, as a rule, have an impact on long term employment or reoffending., There are a number of possible reasons for this, among them the tendency to treat ‘offenders’ as a homogeneous group, rather than as a quite varied group in terms of their needs and skills. Hence it may be that more fine grained analyses (see, for example, Criminological Highlights, 4(3)#6) would demonstrate positive effects for certain types of offenders (in certain kinds of programs).   In addition, of course, there is no reason to believe that all ‘programs’ that label themselves as providing transitional jobs and/or job training are going to be equally effective.  It may be that there are only certain components of the programs that are successful, and that only some programs have components that reduce offending (see Criminological Highlights 6(4)#5)., One of the more intriguing findings, however, is “the well-known fact that graduates of employment training programs recidivate at lower rates than non-graduates, and they perform better in the labour market” (p. 22).  In evaluating overall program effects, this form of self-selection is a problem in that those who drop out have chosen not to receive the full ‘dose’ of the program.   Typically, then, the ‘program’ as a whole is evaluated by its ability to affect all of those initially assigned to it, not only those who choose to complete it., Evaluators of programs see dropouts as a problem. But the difference between dropouts and those who complete the programs may itself be interesting.  Completion of an employment program may serve as “a valid and powerful demonstration of the potential function of program completion as a desistance signal during reentry” (p. 22).  Said differently, those offenders who choose to do the hard work of successfully completing an employment program may be ‘signalling’ the fact that they have decided to stop offending.  Thus the program may provide an opportunity, in a timely and intuitive fashion, to identify those who have themselves chosen to make efforts to stop offending.  This is similar to a suggestion made some years ago about the mechanism for positive impacts of restorative justice programs: they  provide offenders with “an opportunity to facilitate a desire, or consolidate a decision, to desist” (Criminological Highlights 9(5)#1)., Conclusion:  The overall effects of employment programs for people leaving prison are not encouraging except in one important way. Doing the hard work to successfully complete these programs provides a valid signal, to anyone watching, that the offender is much more likely than those who did not complete the program (or than similar offenders who did not have an opportunity to enrol in the program) to stop offending.  For a potential employer, then, successful completion of the program is a valid signal that the former prisoner is ready to go straight., Reference: Bushway, Shawn D. and Robert Apel (2012).  A Signaling Perspective on Employment-Based Reentry Programming: Training Completion as a Desistance Signal.

The imprisonment of parents increases the property offending of their sons.,"It is well established that crime tends to run in families.  There are many explanations for cross-generational similarity in the involvement in crime such as similarity in levels of economic deprivation or child rearing methods, social learning, etc.  This paper looks at the cross-generational similarity in a different way, suggesting that there may be an independent effect of parental incarceration on the criminal behaviour of children., This study examines data obtained from a sample of boys in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who were first interviewed when they were between 7 and 13 years old. They were then followed for 12 years. The youths were chosen, in part, because they were considered to be at high risk for offending.   The child and a parent (typically the mother) were interviewed every six months for the duration of the study. The youth’s involvement in property crimes (thefts, purse snatching, automobile thefts and stealing from a car, and breaking and entering), as well as marijuana use were examined., The challenge, in terms of determining whether incarceration of parents has any effect on children, is that “Because parental incarceration is associated with parental criminality, antisocial behaviour, and multiple other childhood risk factors, children of incarcerated parents may already be at risk for problem behaviour before their parent is incarcerated” (p. 270).   In order to control for such pre-existing factors,  the offending risk for children whose parents were subsequently incarcerated  was assessed in comparison to a control group that was created consisting of similar youths. Because some of the parents had been incarcerated in the past (i.e. before the study period), this study does not look only at the impact of the first incarceration of a parent but rather at the impact of incarceration after the beginning of the study., For each child with a parent who was incarcerated during the study period, three children in the study were located who were very similar but who did not have an incarcerated parent.  The children without an incarcerated parent were comparable to the child with the incarcerated parent on 14 measures, including the following: age of the child, criminal history and incarcerations of the parent, parental supervision of the child, offending by the child, school performance, and relationship of the child with peers and family., Compared to the matched controls, youths were more likely to commit property crimes in each year after the incarceration of a parent. The design allowed children to be followed for up to 6 years after the parental incarceration. There were no effects of parental incarceration on marijuana use by the children, depression, or academic performance.  Subsequent analyses suggest that much of the impact of parental incarceration is related to reduced involvement of the boy with the family (as assessed by the family and the youth) and to the boy’s involvement with delinquent peers. The results also showed that the effect of parental incarceration on White youths might be larger than the effect on Black youths., Conclusion:   The incarceration of a parent appears to have a negative impact on male children above and beyond pre-existing disadvantages that children of incarcerated parents might experience.  Combined with other findings suggesting that incarceration itself may either increase the likelihood of re-offending or have no effect on re-offending (Criminological Highlights 11(1)#1&#2, 11(4)#2, 11(6)#4, 12(5)#8), it  is likely that policies that lead to the incarceration of offenders can simultaneously have an impact on their future criminal behaviour as well as that of their sons., Reference: Murray, Joseph, Rolf Loeber, and Dustin Pardini (2012).  Parental Involvement in the Criminal Justice System and the Development of Youth Theft, Marijuana Use, Depression and Poor Academic Performance.  Criminology, 50 (1) 255-302., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV12N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-12-no-5-%E2%80%93-may-2012,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 12, No. 5 – May 2012",Regular Issue,2012
Treating suspects fairly is important even in the war against terrorism.,", A substantial amount of research suggests that the manner in which people are treated by the police is important in understanding how legitimate the police and other authorities such as the courts (Criminological Highlights 11(5)#1) are seen to be (Criminological Highlights, 4(4)#1,  7(1)#4).  More recently it has been shown that the willingness of members of the Muslim community in New York to work voluntarily with the police in combating terrorism is determined, in part, by how Muslims are treated by the police and others in the community (Criminological Highlights 11(4)#1).  This paper explores the question of whether “procedural justice” (e.g., neutrality in decision making, trust in the motives of the police, and treatment with respect) is as important in responding to threats of terrorism and in dealing with Muslim groups as it is in responding to ordinary criminal activity., Since 2001, policing strategies in the US have changed to include concern about terrorism in addition to ordinary crime.  Furthermore, policing has often focused on a new group – Muslim Americans.  Using data from four different New York City surveys, this study compares Muslim Americans’ perceptions of the policing of terrorism to their perceptions of policing of ordinary crime.  In addition, it examines non-Muslim views of police counterterrorism efforts.  Hence it allows comparisons of the importance of procedural justice in two different domains (crime and anti-terrorism) as well as comparisons of those most affected by anti-terrorism policing (Muslim Americans) with those less likely to be targeted., Looking at the willingness to cooperate with the police (e.g., in reporting dangerous or suspicious activities to the police and in encouraging members of the community to cooperate with the police), for all groups (Muslims, non-Muslim minorities, and whites), the perceived legitimacy of the police was related to willingness to cooperate for both ordinary policing and anti-terror policing.  Perceived legitimacy of the police – for all three groups – was influenced by how fair and professional the police were seen to be.  But the effects of perceptions of legitimacy relate to more than just the perceptions of the treatment of one’s own group: white respondents view the police as less fair if they target minority groups in addressing ordinary crime.  Furthermore, “non-Muslims view the police as unfair and less legitimate if they target the Muslim community and if they treat Muslims disrespectfully” (p. 429).   Suspicion of Muslims itself was not viewed as being unfair by Muslims or non-Muslim respondents, but targeting the Muslim community reduced the legitimacy of the police., Conclusion: “The shift in policing from crime control to counterterrorism does not appear to have changed public expectations of police behaviour or to have altered the basis on which police are evaluated…” (p. 435).   Procedural justice mechanisms are just as important for Muslim Americans as they are for non-Muslim minorities and for whites. “Even when police confront grave threats, both minority and majority populations expect law enforcement officers to respect procedural justice values and are more likely to withhold their cooperation if they do not…. Non-Muslims, who rate the threat of terror as larger than do Muslims, are nonetheless sensitive to procedural justice in counterterrorism policing, particularly the targeting and harassment of Muslims” (p. 436).  “Three elements of procedural justice – neutrality in decision making, trust in the motives of the police, and treatment with respect – remain central to the definition of procedural justice and its effect on legitimacy” (p. 437).  This is just as true in dealing with terrorism as it is in responding to ordinary crime., Reference:  Huq, Aziz Z., Tom R.

Courts create the conditions for youths to commit the criminal offence of ‘failure to comply with court orders’ by imposing large numbers of conditions on youths when they are released on bail and then delaying the resolution of the case.,", Although Canada’s 2003 Youth Criminal Justice Act has succeeded in reducing the number of youths brought to youth court (see Criminological Highlights, 10(1)#1, 10(3)#1),  the number and rate of cases in which the most serious charge is the failure to comply with a court order (largely failure to comply with conditions of release on bail) has not decreased. In 2009, this one administration of justice offence represented about 7% of all cases brought to youth court in Canada.  This paper describes how youth courts ‘set youths up’ to fail and be charged criminally for non-compliance with their terms of release., Conditions of release on bail are not supposed to serve as punishments, though obviously restrictions on youths’ (or adults’) daily activities are almost certainly experienced as punishment.  Instead, conditions of release on bail (e.g., curfews, non-association orders, reporting conditions) are supposed to be designed to help ensure that the youth will appear in court as required and not engage in criminal activity while awaiting trial. Some police services have ‘bail compliance units’ designed to “conduct bail compliance checks any hour of the day or night” (p. 407).   The justification for these bail compliance checks is, officially, to ensure that conditions are adhered to., This study followed the court careers of a representative sample of youths who were detained by the police, taken to bail court, and then released on bail (between 2003 and 2008) from one of Toronto’s large youth courts. Youths were then tracked through the court system by examining records of their court appearances from the original bail hearing to the disposition of the original charges.  Youths in the Toronto courts had varying numbers of conditions imposed on them: 45% of the youths received seven or more separate bail conditions.  About half of the cases (47%) took less than 6 months to be completed, but 53% took 6 months or more to be resolved.  While the original case was being processed, 32% of the youths returned to court with a new charge of failure to comply with a court order (the bail order).  This charge was, sometimes, combined with other substantive charges., The data are clear, however, on the role of the court in contributing to these new ‘failure to comply’ charges.  New charges of  ‘failure to comply with a court order’ were especially likely to be laid in those cases that took more than 6 months to be resolved and where the youth was required, during this period, to comply with large numbers of conditions (7 or more). In fact, in 60% of such cases, youths acquired new charges of ‘failure to comply with a court order.’, In contrast, for cases resolved in less than 6 months, the number of bail conditions had no impact on the likelihood of a ‘failure to comply with a court order’ charge being laid: 17% of those with 1-6 conditions and 22% of those with 7 or more bail conditions had new charges laid for ‘failure to comply.’    For those whose cases took more than 6 months but who had few (6 or fewer) bail conditions, only 34% had charges laid for failure to comply with a court order., Conclusion:  It would appear that courts can increase the likelihood of a youth being brought back to court for a new criminal offence of failure to comply with a court order by imposing large numbers of bail conditions and then by being inefficient in disposing of the case.   When one considers that some of these conditions involve quite serious intrusions into a youth’s life – e.g., curfews, restrictions on where they can go, prohibitions on meeting with or communicating with named other youths – it is not surprising that the likelihood of a violation of the condition would go up in time.  In addition, of course, more time and more conditions increases the probability that police officers would discover that a youth had violated a condition of release., Reference: Sprott, Jane B. and Nicole M. Myers (2011).  Set Up to Fail: The Unintended Consequences of Multiple Bail Conditions.  Canadian Journal of Criminology & Criminal Justice, 53 (4), 404-423., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV12N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-12-no-5-%E2%80%93-may-2012,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 12, No. 5 – May 2012",Regular Issue,2012
Juvenile sex offenders who met the criteria of the US federal law requiring registration as sex offenders were no more likely to reoffend – sexually or otherwise – than were offenders who did not meet the registration criteria.,", Even though sex offenders are not especially likely to re-offend (Criminological Highlights 3(3)#3, 5(1)#4, 6(3)#3, 6(6)#8, 8(3)#8, 9(2)#5), many jurisdictions have special restrictions or monitoring programs for sex offenders after they are released that are designed, in part, to reduce reoffending (Criminological Highlights, 4(1)#2, 5(6)#1, 7(4)#4, 8(6)#5, 9(2)#7), 10(3)#7, 11(4)#7, 11(6)#6 12(2)#4). They have not, however, been shown to be effective in reducing crime. The American Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act puts financial pressure on states to comply with its requirements, including the requirement that certain juveniles be subject to registration and notification laws.   After they are registered as sex offenders, some juvenile sex offenders can have this registration terminated only after 10 or 25 years of offence-free living in the community. For others, the registration lasts forever., The problem raised by such an approach with youths is that “sexual behaviour that is often defined as illegal is common among youth” (p. 456), including non-coercive peer (teen) sexual activity, and the posting of suggestive sexual photographs of themselves (which can, under some laws, be considered  trafficking in child pornography).  In one national study, it was found that over one third of children and adolescents in the US reported engaging in sexual intercourse before they were of legal age (as defined by the state in which they lived).  Hence the law has “the potential to inappropriately include normative youth not at risk for continued sexual offending on sex offence registries” (p. 457).  This is especially a problem given that juvenile sex offending is not predictive of adult sex offending (Criminological Highlights 9(2)#5).  As of 2010, only a few states, not including Pennsylvania (where this study was carried out), had implemented juvenile registration and notification., This study tracked a group of 108 male juvenile sex offenders in Pennsylvania for two years after they completed court-ordered treatment. About two thirds had been found guilty of indecent assault.  Both adult and juvenile re-offending was recorded.  Only two of the youths reoffended sexually – one of the 67 who would have met registration and notification requirements and one of the 41 who did not meet sexual registration and notification requirements.  Their sexual offences were indecent assault or indecent exposure. The overall reoffending rate (for any offence) did not differ significantly for the two groups (15% for those who would have been eligible for registration and 19.5% for those who would not have been eligible for registration).  Indeed, as with other studies, the ‘sexual reoffending’ rate was very low for both groups., Conclusion:  It seems that simple ‘offence based’ registration requirements for juvenile sex offenders are not likely to identify those who are going to offend again. Those subject to registration requirements were no more likely to reoffend than those not subject to registration requirements.  This study, like others, demonstrates that the likelihood of reoffending for juvenile sex offenders is very low.  The concern, then, of requiring registration of these offenders is that registration will have an impact on youths’ “ability to become productive members of society by diminishing social bonds and placing restrictions on employment, housing, and education” (p. 460)., Reference: Batastini, Ashley B., Elizabeth Hunt, Julie Present-Koller and David DeMatteo (2011).  Federal Standards for Community Registration of Juvenile Sex Offenders: an Evaluation of Risk Prediction and Future Implications.   Psychology, Public Policy, and Law, 17 (3), 451-474., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV12N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-12-no-5-%E2%80%93-may-2012,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 12, No. 5 – May 2012",Regular Issue,2012
"Canadian youths who are Aboriginal, Black, or of Arab or Middle East background are more likely than other youths be questioned by the police even when other relevant factors such as involvement in crime have been taken into account.",", Disproportionate contact with the criminal justice system by various segments of society is a well established criminological fact.  For example, for decades, Aboriginal people have been over-represented in Canada’s prisons – in comparison to the proportion of the population that they represent.  Some of the over-representation of certain groups may be due to differences in the involvement of crime. The challenge, however, is to determine whether, in fact, members of certain groups are more likely to be stopped and questioned by the police even when involvement in crime is controlled., This study used data from a nationally representative survey of 4,164 Canadian youths age 12-17 in 2000/1.  One survey question asked them whether they had been “questioned by the police about anything they thought you did” in the year prior to being interviewed.  The parent most knowledgeable about the youth was also interviewed.  Youths were asked about their involvement in three types of crime: violence, property and drugs.  Information was also obtained on the youth’s family structure, household income, whether the youth stayed out all night or had run away, the relationship with parents, parental monitoring of the youth, and friends’ involvement with drugs or other crime., The youths were categorized as White or one of two separate groups: (1) Aboriginal, Black, and Arab/Middle Eastern youths who were thought to be particularly vulnerable to special treatment by the police;  and (2) all others (largely East and South Asians).  The Aboriginal/ Black/ Arab/ Middle Eastern group was found to be at ‘high risk’ of police contact (compared to Whites and other visible minorities).  They are the focus of the study.  This ‘high risk’ group was, however, also more likely to report involvement in violent crime (but not property or drug crime).  Not surprisingly, self-reported involvement in all three types of crime increased the likelihood of contact with the police., More important is the finding that controlling simultaneously for the three forms of self-reported delinquency did not reduce the higher likelihood of police contact for youths from this ‘high risk’ group. In addition, when other factors that were shown to be related to police contact and to membership in this ‘high risk group’ were controlled (e.g., staying out all night or running away from home, living in rental accommodation, low income), the effect of being a member of the ‘high risk’ group on police contact did not change appreciably.  Interestingly, however, the impact of being a member of the ‘high risk’ group on police contact was larger for non-violent youths. Indeed, for youths who reported involvement in violence in the previous year, there was not a significant difference in the amount of contact with police for those from this ‘high risk’ group compared to the other groups. However, there was a sizable difference in level of police contact for youths who had not been involved in violent crime in the previous year: 28.5% of the ‘high risk’ minority youths had contact with the police compared to only 10.1% of the other youths., Conclusion: Even controlling for involvement in crime as well as other relevant factors, Canadian youths who are Black, Aboriginal, or of Arab/Middle Eastern background are more likely than other youths to be questioned by the police about possible offending.  This overall finding, and the fact that the effect was due largely to differential treatment of non-violent youths, lends some support to the conclusion that the difference in treatment of the two groups relates to racial targeting on the part of the police., Reference:  Fitzgerald, Robin T. and Peter J.

"Variation across neighbourhoods in legal cynicism – i.e., lack of support for the legitimacy of laws and lack of confidence in the police – helps explain why some Chicago neighbourhoods maintained high homicide rates even when homicide rates elsewhere were decreasing.",", Previous research has shown that residents of socially disadvantaged neighbourhoods with high rates of violent crime have low levels of tolerance for violence or crime.  However, “while individuals may believe in the substance of the law, antagonism toward and mistrust of the agents of the law may propel some individuals toward violence simply because they feel they cannot rely upon the police to help them resolve grievances” (p. 1191), an argument similar to that made to explain the relative reduction, over time, of homicides by the elite (see Criminological Highlights 1(3)#3).  Legal cynicism is part of the culture of a neighbourhood.  This conceptualization of culture views it “not as values but as a repertoire of tools that ultimately serve as a guide for action” (p. 1195)., Residents of a neighbourhood “acquire culture relationally, through their interactions in social networks” (p. 1195).  Thus, for example, “cynicism toward the law does not directly cause neighbourhood violence….”  Instead, the culture of a neighbourhood may be one of mistrust of agents of the law, such that “individuals will resort to illegal violence to redress a problem instead of abiding by the letter of the law” (p. 1203)., This study examines the homicide rate of 342 neighbourhoods in Chicago, looking at characteristics of neighbourhoods rather than of individuals.  In Chicago, in the early 1990s, there was, not surprisingly, a positive correlation between concentrated poverty of a neighbourhood and legal cynicism, but a small negative relationship between legal cynicism and tolerance for deviance., The level of legal cynicism was positively related to the homicide rate in the late 1990s above and beyond the impact of concentrated poverty, tolerance for deviance and other neighbourhood characteristics. More importantly, although the neighbourhood homicide rate in the early 1990s was a predictor of the neighbourhood homicide rate in the late 1990s, legal cynicism (measured in the middle of the decade) remained a predictor of late-1990s homicide rates even after controlling for the earlier homicide rate. In fact, the level of legal cynicism of the people in the neighbourhood predicted the change in homicide rates from the early 1990s to the early 2000s: neighbourhoods in which the culture was one in which the law and police were not trusted tended to be those whose homicide rates remained high, while neighbourhoods not characterised by legal cynicism tended to have decreased homicide rates., Conclusion: It is important to remember that ‘legal cynicism’ and ‘tolerance for deviance or violence’ are quite separate constructs. But “when the law is perceived to be unavailable – for example, when calling the police is not a viable option to remedy one’s problems – individuals may instead resolve their grievances by their own means, which may include violence… In this sense, cultural frames have a constraining influence; cynicism constrains choice if individuals presume that the law is unavailable or unresponsive to their needs, thus pushing individuals to engage in their own brand of social control” (p. 1128)., Reference: Kirk, David S. and Andrew V.

"Youths sentenced to custody in New South Wales, Australia, were as likely to re-offend as were equivalent youths who received community-based sanctions.",", Although there is a fair amount of research suggesting that, compared to the effect of a community sanction, imprisonment does not decrease re-offending in adults (see Criminological Highlights 11(1)#1, 11(1)#2, 11(4)#2, 11(6)#4), 12(5)#8), there is less information about the impact of imprisonment on youths (Criminological Highlights, 10(6)#1, 12(1)#8) perhaps because there is a more general presumption that formal processing can be harmful for youths (Criminological Highlights, 11(4)#3)., This study used data from youth cases in New South Wales in which the youth was convicted of one or more charges.  In order to create equivalent groups, an analysis was done to determine the predictors of receiving a detention or prison order (rather than a community-based sanction).  The predictors of a prison sentence were prior imprisonment, offence seriousness, other offences in the case, offender sex, prior record, whether the offence took place in a city or a more remote area, and age.   Aboriginal status did not predict sentence after these other factors were taken into account. 
In general, those sent to prison were more likely to have been previously incarcerated, to have a record, to have more serious offences, etc.  Hence in order to create equivalent groups, youths who were sent to prison were matched with youths who had similar ‘propensity’ to receive a custodial sentence but did not actually receive one.  This technique necessarily meant that some extreme cases were excluded from the comparison because matches could not be found. For example, it is unlikely that an equivalent community-sentenced case could be found as a match for a very serious case that resulted in a custodial sentence. Youths were tracked for an average of 21 months and up to 1000 days or more., After the matching, there were no differences between the two groups (those who received custody and those who received a community-based sanction) on factors that went into the ‘propensity score’ (e.g., age, criminal record, current offence, etc).   Looking at the matched sample, the ‘survival’ in the community of the two groups (prison and community sanction) were fairly similar. In other words, their propensity to reoffend and the timing of their reoffending were very similar.  In addition, an analysis was carried out using recidivism within one year as the dependent variable.  The matched groups had very similar likelihoods of reoffending., Conclusion:  “The imposition of a custodial sentence had no effect on risk of reoffending” (p. 39).   Clearly no matching study is perfect and it can always be argued that with better matching a different result might have been found.  However, given that these findings are broadly similar to other recent research on this topic, it seems unlikely that more finely tuned matching would result in a reoffending benefit from imprisonment. Since youths spent only an average of about 8 months in prison, any incapacitation effect of imprisonment would likely be  rather small.  “The current results, therefore, strengthen the argument in favour of using custodial penalties with juvenile offenders as sparingly as possible” (p. 40) given the relative costs of imprisonment and community sanctions., Reference:  McGrath, Andrew and Don Weatherburn (2012).  Australian & New Zealand Journal of Criminology, 45 (1), 26-44., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV12N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-12-no-5-%E2%80%93-may-2012,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 12, No. 5 – May 2012",Regular Issue,2012
"Compared to a community sanction, imprisonment increases the likelihood of reoffending for adult offenders in Florida  This conclusion is consistent across three quite different methods of controlling for other factors and is consistent when recidivism is measured for one, two and three year follow-up periods.",", Recently published research suggests that imprisoning offenders – as compared to giving them community sanctions – either has no impact on re-offending, or makes them more likely to reoffend (see Criminological Highlights 11(1)#1, 11(1)#2, 11(4)#2, 11(6)#4, 12(5)#7)., This study examines the impact of imprisonment on reoffending for a group of Florida offenders who were either sent to prison or received a community sanction that included house arrest –  confining offenders to their home except for travel to work, treatment, or the probation office (unless authorized in advance by the probation officer).  Re-offending was defined as a new felony conviction resulting in jail, prison, or community supervision., Looking at these two groups as a whole – prison vs. house arrest – one is not surprised to see that the prison sample as a whole was more likely to reoffend within all three time periods since they differed on many variables (sex, race, age, current offence, criminal history) related to reoffending.  The challenge, therefore, is to create equivalent groups of people who either went to prison or were punished in the community., Three techniques were used: (1) Traditional logistic regression where each of the variables related to recidivism was controlled for statistically; (2) “Precision matching” in which people – one of whom was sentenced to prison, the other who was sentenced to house arrest – were matched on a series of relevant factors; or (3) Through the use of matching on a ‘propensity to reoffend’ score. Propensity-to-reoffend scores were first created for 500 prison and 500 house arrest offenders. Then an attempt was made to find an offender in the other group with an almost identical estimated ‘propensity to reoffend’ score. The latter two methods necessarily resulted in some people being unmatchable.  For example, it is likely that some of very serious cases that resulted in prison sentences would not have equivalent matches in the house arrest cases., A number of different matching approximations were used for each of the latter two methods.  In addition, as indicated, recidivism within 1, 2, and 3 years of release from prison were examined. The results are consistent: Recidivism rates at each point in time were somewhat higher for those who were sent to prison than for those who were sentenced to house arrest.  The size of the differences varied with the exact form of matching and the time period in question.  But a relatively typical finding was that the three year recidivism rate for those sent to prison would be about 48% compared to 38% for those given house arrest., Conclusion:  It is often suggested that sending people to prison must reduce crime since at least some of those who are in prison would, if they were in the community, commit at least some crimes.  Though this may be true, the overall crime control estimates of imprisonment should take into account studies such as this one, that show that after release former prisoners may be more criminally active than they would be if they had been punished in the community.  Clearly, however, the data are not entirely consistent across studies on whether prison reliably makes prisoners more criminally active than they would be had they not been imprisoned.  The conservative conclusion is that imprisonment does not reduce reoffending.  Nevertheless, these findings along with other published studies add weight to the conclusion that imprisonment can, at least for some types of offenders, increase reoffending., Reference: Bales, William D. and Alex R. Piquero (2012).  Assessing the impact of imprisonment on recidivism.  Journal of Experimental Criminology, 8, 71-101., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV12N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-12-no-5-%E2%80%93-may-2012,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 12, No. 5 – May 2012",Regular Issue,2012
"The effect of harsh school policies on violent offending – those favouring suspension from school rather than sanctions carried out within school – can be counterproductive. For youths who tend to make careful decisions about their own lives, harsh school policies are associated with increased violent offending.","It has been suggested that “an individual’s ability to process information adequately and to consider available choices effectively” – sometimes referred to as “thoughtfully reflective decision making” – will be important in youths’ choices to avoid involvement in crime (p. 499).   There is some evidence, however, that “settings with high levels of sanctioning [may] disarm individuals’ cognitive decision making processes and attenuate the effect of thoughtfully reflective decision making on delinquent behaviours” (p. 501)., As part of a survey of adolescents in Grades 7 through 12 in 132 American schools, school administrators were asked to indicate what the school does with a youth who is caught, for the first time, fighting with another youth.  Almost 70% removed the youth from school temporarily or expelled them permanently from the school.  Youths in these schools were assessed on their level of thoughtfully reflective decision making by asking their level of agreement with questions such as “When you have a problem to solve, one of the first things you do is to get as many facts about the problem as possible.” Youths also were asked about their own violent offending, generally, not just in school.  Previous research would suggest that a substantial amount of youth violence takes place in or around school., Overall, youths who generally engage in thoughtfully reflective decision making were less involved in violence.  This effect held up even when various individual characteristics (e.g., sex, age, race, family structure, school performance, prior levels of violence, and the amount of unstructured socializing they engaged in) were controlled statistically. In addition, youths attending schools that removed youths from schools after they were caught fighting were somewhat more likely to engage in violence., However, the effect of thoughtful decision making on violence differed depending on schools’ policies. For youths attending schools that used less harsh (in-school) techniques of responding to fights, the youths who engaged in thoughtful decision making were less likely to be violent than were those who did not engage in thoughtful decision making. Most importantly, however, the extent to which the youth engaged in thoughtfully reflective decision making was essentially irrelevant for those youths who went to schools with harsh levels of punishment for violence.  It appeared that engaging in thoughtful decision making was rendered irrelevant by harsh school discipline procedures., Conclusion: Some of the most common delinquency prevention programs involve improving adolescents’ cognitive skills, or, in the context of these findings, encouraging thoughtful and reflective decision making.   However, these findings suggest that “harsher school disciplinary regimes disarm the process of cognitive reflection.”  Though there was some evidence that simple harsh policies (suspensions from school) might be associated with lower levels of certain misbehaviour (being drunk in school) for those youths with “extremely weak cognitive skills”,  these positive effects were offset by the fact that harsh school sanctions undermined the generally favourable impact of thoughtful decision making., Reference:  Maimon, David, Olena Antonaccio, and Michael T.

"When the motivation and opportunities to act in an illegal or unethical manner are held constant, those of higher social class are more likely to engage in unethical or illegal behaviour.",", “Greater resources, freedom, and independence from others among the upper class give rise to self-focused social cognitive tendencies….The recent (world) economic crisis has been attributed in part to the unethical actions of the wealthy… These results parallel [US] findings showing that upper-class households donate a smaller proportion of their incomes to charity than do lower class households” (p. 1).  Seven studies were done to test whether upper class individuals were more likely to act in their own self-interest in circumstances where the motivation for self-interested behaviour was fairly similar for all types of individuals., In the first study, observers recorded the status of cars approaching a busy four way stop. The California Vehicle Code requires vehicles to yield to any other car that has already arrived at the intersection.  The observers recorded whether the driver of the target car cut off, or did not yield, to the driver who had the right of way. ‘Upper class’ drivers [defined by ratings of their cars] were the most likely to cut off  other vehicles at the intersection even when controlling for sex and age of driver, time of day, and amount of traffic.  A second study found that ‘upper class’ drivers (again, defined by their cars) were more likely not to yield to pedestrians at cross-walks. In a third study, students indicated their own social class and were presented with scenarios in which the protagonist improperly took or benefitted from something.  Again, higher social class was associated with higher levels of unethical behaviour., In the 4th study people were randomly assigned to compare themselves either to those with the highest or the lowest income, education, or prestigious jobs.  Those who compared themselves with lower status people described themselves, and apparently thought of themselves temporarily, as relatively higher in social class than those who compared themselves with high social class others. They were then put in a room where there was a jar of candy ostensibly intended for children and told that they could take ‘some’.  Those who had been induced to think of themselves as ‘higher class’ people took more candy (from the children) than those induced to think of themselves as ‘lower class’ people.  A 5th study asked participants to imagine that they were an employer offering a job to someone looking for a permanent job.  They were told that the job would be eliminated in 6 months and were asked whether they would tell a job applicant that the job was temporary in order to get the applicant to accept the job that he otherwise might turn down.  Upper class individuals were less likely to tell the job applicant the full nature of the job, and therefore, acted in their own self interest. A 6th study measured the propensity to cheat at a game of chance.  The results showed that upper class participants were more likely to cheat because of their favourable views of greed. The 7th study suggests that focusing on the benefits of greed eliminated the social class difference, suggesting that upper class people ‘naturally’ assume that greed is good., Conclusion:  Seven studies demonstrate that “relative to lower-class individuals, individuals from upper-class backgrounds behaved more unethically in both naturalistic and laboratory settings.  It would appear that for ‘upper class individuals’ more favourable attitudes toward greed can help explain their propensity toward unethical behaviour. Furthermore, economics education, with its focus on self-interest maximization, may lead people to view greed as positive and beneficial…. The findings suggest that the pursuit of self-interest is a more fundamental motive among society’s elite [than it is for others]” (p. 4)., Reference: Piff, Paul K., Daniel M.

Systems of incentives and earned privileges in prisons may create more problems than they solve.,", In 1995, a policy of ‘incentives and earned privileges’ (IEP) was introduced into the prison system in England and Wales.  Popular politically, the program was based on the idea that ‘good behaviour’ would be rewarded with certain privileges.  The theory was simple: prison order would be easier to maintain and prisoners who behaved themselves would get the privileges they deserved., The difficulties with the program begin with attempts to operationalize what is meant by ‘good behaviour’ and privileges.  Rewarding prisoners for good behaviour and punishing them for bad is, of course, not new.  But starting around 1993, “there was a marked harshening of the emotional tone of penal policy” (p. 28) which focused in large part on security and control.  More generally, however, it seems that the Prison Service  “had a somewhat simplified conception of the links between incentives, compliance in prison, and the likelihood of reduced reoffending on release” (p. 29). One difficulty is that ‘non-compliance’ takes many forms – non-engagement, for example.  But, in addition, the ‘key earnables’ (p. 31)  were such things as extra and improved visits with families, access to television and one’s own clothes, and time to interact with other prisoners., Though prison staff approved of IEP, a systematic evaluation of the program in five prisons suggests that the operation of IEP may have been unfair.  Prisoners were uncertain about what was actually required, and prison officers were unaware of procedures that were designed to make IEP operate fairly.  It was unclear whether prisoners had obligations to participate in certain treatment programs, whether privilege levels transferred with prisoners when they were moved to other institutions, and what the relationship of IEP decisions to classification and release/transfer decisions was.  Prisoners saw the inclusion of family contact in the list of ‘earnables’ as being both unfair and counterproductive, since reintegration was harder to arrange if privileges involving visits were restricted., More generally, however, wings of some prisons “developed significantly different practices” from others (p. 34). From the perspective of prisoners, “Overall, there were significant losses to staff-prisoner relationships, perceived fairness of staff and the [prison] regime, and perceptions of procedural justice in all five prisons” (p. 35).  Staff, on the other hand, tended to like IEP because “it gave them a lever and could sometimes be used effectively to motivate individual prisoners” (p. 37).  They believed IEP “improved prisoner behaviour, even though the evidence did not support this perception” (p. 37)., Conclusion: As a result of the initial evaluation, which clearly found serious problems, there has been increased emphasis on fairness and a decrease in the punitive tone of the policy within the English prison system.  The “language of rights and responsibilities is being used to emphasize earned privileges and links to addressing offending in part to offset (misguided) public and media concerns about ‘cushy’ prisons’.” (p. 39).  More generally, however, the study shows that “There are limits to a rational choice model of prisoner behaviour, particularly with prisoners who find prison life difficult…. Maintaining dignity was more important to some prisoners than ‘being rewarded’.” (p. 39).  “The key theoretical lesson… was that prison officers deploy their authority through relationships with prisoners.  They use the rules [only] when relationships don’t work, and this is one of the reasons for the centrality of staff-prisoner relationships to prison life.  If they resort to the formal rules without first going through relationships – without talking first – this is bad news for prison stability” (p. 40)., Reference: Liebling, Alison (2008).

Having a medical marijuana dispensary in a neighbourhood does not increase neighbourhood crime.,", In 17 US states, marijuana can be sold legally to those who have a documented medical reason for using it.  Concern has sometimes been expressed about the impact of having a marijuana dispensary in one’s neighbourhood because of the perceived connection between ‘drugs’ and ‘crime,’ and the assumption that the presence of a dispensary means cash and drugs are likely to be carried by those using the dispensary., However, marijuana dispensaries are not placed randomly in urban neighbourhoods: there is some reason to believe that for economic or other reasons they may be placed in high crime areas of the city. Hence it is necessary to go beyond a simple measure of the crime rate in neighbourhoods with medical marijuana dispensaries compared to crime rates in other areas of the city., This study therefore examined violent and property crime rates in Sacramento, California’s 95 census areas.  Twenty-eight of the census areas had at least one marijuana dispensary.  Not surprisingly, crime rates were correlated with such factors as the number of vacant housing dwellings (probably a measure of urban decay), high concentrations of single or disrupted households, high concentrations of males, high unemployment rates, and high concentrations of poor families.  Without taking into account these (and other) factors, the presence of medical marijuana dispensaries was associated with violent and property crime., The more appropriate analysis, however, which controlled statistically for the neighbourhood factors known to be associated with crime, showed that above and beyond those factors, the presence of medical marijuana dispensaries was not associated with an increase in the violent or property crime rate in the neighbourhood.
It appears that the factors related to crime rates in these California census tracts are consistent with studies of neighbourhood crime reported in other research.  “However, no cross-sectional associations were observed between the density of medical marijuana dispensaries and violent or property crime rates, controlling for ecological variables traditionally associated with [theories of crime]” (p. 528)., Conclusion: Although this study does not show an association between the presence of medical marijuana dispensaries and crime, it is, of course, possible that the introduction of these dispensaries could have had an effect on the neighbourhood characteristics that might affect crime.  However, the research findings in this study “run contrary to public perceptions” (p. 529) and suggest there is no simple relationship between the presence of medical marijuana dispensaries and crime.  When such an association is seen, the higher level of crime is more likely to be due to other characteristics of the neighbourhood (e.g., relative poverty, etc.)., Reference: Kepple, Nancy J. and Bridget Freisthler (2012).  Exploring the Ecological Association Between Crime and Medical Marijuana Dispensaries.  Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs, 73 (4), 523-530., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV12N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-12-no-6-%E2%80%93-september-2012,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 12, No. 6 – September 2012",Regular Issue,2012
"When the police use Conducted Energy Devices (CEDs, known, typically as TASERs) in ‘use of force’ incidents, the accused person is more likely to suffer an injury than when CEDs are not used.",", Police are authorized to use force in circumstances in which ordinary citizens do not have this authority. In recent years, Conducted Energy Devices (CEDs), often referred to as TASERS, have been described as a tool that can “quickly, safely, and fully incapacitate citizens” without injury to them. Though the focus of controversy on the use of CEDs has been on deaths (e.g., the death of Robert Dziekański in the Vancouver, Canada, airport in 2007), this study addresses a more general question: Is the use of CEDs associated with increased injuries to citizens?, One of the advantages of CEDs is that they can be used at a distance and are not as lethal as firearms. Nevertheless, concerns have been expressed about their use.  This study moves from individual case studies to systematically collected data on the use of CEDs in 13,913 ‘use of force’ incidents in 7 US police agencies in which ordinary officers had CEDs available to them.  The main data came from police ‘use of force’ reports filled out by police officers.  Police officers used CEDs in 18% of these incidents (in 5% of cases CEDs were used alone, and in 13% they were used along with other forms of force).  The researchers looked at the use of CEDs in relation to any citizen injury, type of injury, and whether the citizen was transported to a hospital.  Various control factors – e.g, whether the citizen showed resistance, the citizen’s age, sex, use of alcohol/drugs, presence of a weapon – were used to assess the impact of CEDs on injuries above and beyond these control factors., There was a citizen injury reported in 32% of the cases – 41% of the cases when the CED was used alone, 47% when the CED was used in combination with some other form of force, and 29% when no CED was used.  Controlling for characteristics of the citizen and the encounter, use of a CED was still positively associated with injuries to the citizen.  Compared to circumstances in which CEDs were not used, citizens were more likely to receive a more severe injury in cases where officers used a CED compared to cases where officers used only ‘hard-hand’ force. In addition, use of a CED increased the likelihood that the citizen needed hospitalization.  Use of CEDs was, however, associated with a lower likelihood of injury, and a lower likelihood of injuries requiring hospital contact when they are compared to use of batons, dogs, or firearms., One difference between this study and others is that in this study all injuries (including those, such as lacerations, burns or abrasions, that were solely the result of being hit with darts from the CED) were counted as injuries.  In some previous studies, injuries directly related to contact with the CED were not counted as injuries.  Injuries from the CED were counted because the alternative – excluding them because they are directly caused by the CED –  ignores the fact that in 55% of cases involving CEDs, there was no injury at all.  Furthermore, to exclude these injuries because they are seen as ‘the intended purpose of the weapon’ would suggest that gunshot wounds should similarly be excluded because they, too, are the intended purpose of the weapon., Conclusion:  There are no weapons that can be used without the risk of some kind of injuries.  CEDs, are a popular weapon for police officers in part because they are seen as a tool that will incapacitate a suspect without increasing the risk of injury.   This study suggests, however, that the use of CEDs may increase rather than decrease the likelihood of injuries to citizens in citizen-police encounters. Given the importance of police legitimacy, these findings from use-of-force reports completed by police officers are clearly important when considering the uses to which CEDs are put., Reference: Terrill, William and Eugene A.

Liberating judges from rigid US federal sentencing guidelines did not have a substantial immediate impact on sentencing.,", The US federal guidelines have been in place since 1987.  For many years they were criticized for being too rigid in that it was difficult for judges to ‘depart’ from the guideline range even in cases where they thought that justice would be served by a departure (see Criminological Highlights, 11(2)#4).  Beginning in 2005, however, a series of US Supreme Court cases expanded judges’ discretion allowing them to sentence outside of the guideline range if they thought it appropriate to do so., Concern was expressed by some that the decisions in these cases would lead to at least two problems: (1) Less consistency across judicial districts since judges were no longer required to follow a national standard, and (2) Increased disparity in sentencing associated with race, gender, and other legally irrelevant dimensions.    One argument that was used to suggest that these problems would not be exacerbated is the fact that most federal district judges have only sentenced under the guidelines and would, therefore, continue to use the guidelines as a benchmark., After the Supreme Court decisions that freed sentencing, somewhat, from the guidelines, the proportion of departures from the prescribed guideline sentence increased somewhat.  Prior to the first of three separate changes to the rigidity of the guidelines, there were departures downward in 13% of the cases; after all of the changes had taken place,  downward departures had increased to 25%.  Upward departures increased from 1% to 1.8%.   Judges were, therefore, somewhat ‘liberated’ from the guidelines in that they were more likely to depart.  However, an increase in overall departures does not necessarily mean that there would be an increase in inter-district variability or an increase in disparity due to extra-legal factors such as race., Looking first at variation across judicial districts, it was found that controlling for characteristics of the offender (e.g., race, age, gender, education) and the case (e.g., offence, criminal record of the offender), there was significant variation across judicial districts before and after the legal changes were implemented.  In other words, judicial districts did vary in their sentences.  However, looking across the various time periods – when the constraints on judges were changed as a result of legislation and court decisions – the amount of variability accounted for by judicial district did not change substantially., Similarly, in each of the four time periods (defined by changes in legislation and Supreme Court decisions) there was significant variation in the sentences that were imposed due to extra-legal factors.  Controlling for legal factors (e.g., offence, record) black and Hispanic offenders were more likely to be incarcerated than whites, women were less likely to be incarcerated than men, and non-citizens were far more likely to be incarcerated than comparable citizens. However, allowing judges additional flexibility in crafting sentences did not lead to substantial changes in the size of the effect of these extra-legal factors., Conclusion:  After US federal sentencing guidelines were deemed to be advisory rather than ‘mandatory’, disparity and local variation do not seem to have increased.  There was ‘extra-legal’ variation before judges were given more leeway in handing down sentences; for the most part, this variation continued.  Greater freedom for judges to consider factors such as whether the offender was employed or had family or community ties and, more generally, “to use their own interpretations of focal concerns in sentencing, need not result in greater extralegal disparity or greater between-district variation, at least within the confines of an overall, now-advisory guidelines regime” (p. 830).  It is possible that the guidelines had, prior to being ‘loosened’, created a culture of what sentences were to be expected.  At least in the short run, giving judges the ability to be flexible did not create chaos in US federal sentencing.  Judges largely followed the guidelines even after they were given additional ability to ignore them., Reference: Ulmer, Jeffery, Michael T. Light, and John Kramer (2011).  The “Liberation” of Federal Judges’ Discretion in the Wake of the Booker/Fanfan Decision: Is There Increased Disparity and Divergence between Courts?”  Justice Quarterly, 28(6), 799-837., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV12N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-12-no-6-%E2%80%93-september-2012,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 12, No. 6 – September 2012",Regular Issue,2012
The incarceration of fathers leads to increased physical aggression in their 5-year old sons.,", It is well established that the incarceration of a parent has collateral effects on families and communities (see Criminological Highlights 12(5)#1, 9(5)#6, 10(2)#2, 10(3)#2).  “Seeing a father arrested, visiting him in prison, and dealing with paternal absence may traumatize children” (p. 285). When combined with diminished financial resources and generally less favourable parenting, the effects on children can be serious. This paper examines the impact of paternal incarceration on very young children’s level of physical aggression., Using data from a longitudinal study of largely ‘at risk’ families, mothers were interviewed in hospital shortly after birth of the child, and again when the child was 1, 3, and 5 years old. The aggressiveness of the child was assessed from the mother’s report when  the child was 3 and 5 years old. The focus of the study was on incarcerations that took place when the child was between 3 and 5 years old.  In addition, data were collected on a large number of ‘risk’ factors including whether the father had been incarcerated prior to the child’s third birthday., Children were matched at age 3 on their likelihood of experiencing paternal incarceration after their third birthday.  Boys who experienced incarceration of their fathers after age 3 were reported to be more physically aggressive at age 5.  This effect held even when the sample was restricted to families in which the father had been incarcerated at some time prior to the boy’s third birthday.  For girls, however, the incarceration of the father after age 3 did not increase childhood aggression., Various statistical tests “provided no evidence that changes in family life (aside from paternal absence and stigma) mediate the relationship between paternal incarceration and boys’ physical aggression” (p. 299).  Other analyses suggest that “the first time boys experience paternal incarceration, they experience it as they would experience the separation of parents – with increasing aggression while the father is gone that dissipates when he returns.  For boys who have already experienced paternal incarceration, a new bout of incarceration has large effects both during the incarceration and after it” (p. 301).  Removing a father who was abusive to the mother had an independent effect of reducing aggressiveness at age 5.  Thus for these families, “the benefits of having a [father who was abusive to the mother] removed from the household may outweigh the costs” (p. 304)., Conclusion:  Perhaps the most important finding, from a policy perspective, is that “the effects of paternal incarceration on boys’ physical aggression are concentrated among boys of nonviolent fathers” (p. 304).  For young boys, 3-5 years old, the incarceration of their fathers appears to cause an increase in aggressive behaviour.  Whether this will translate into criminal behaviour when the child is older is, of course, not known.  However, given that the increase in childhood aggressiveness from paternal incarceration is concentrated in families of non-violent offenders, an examination of sentencing policies for these offenders might be warranted, Reference: Wildeman, Christopher (2010).

One of the collateral effects of imprisonment is that the imprisonment of the father of a young child increases the likelihood of a major depressive episode in the mother.,", , In some communities – most notably low income minority communities in theU.S. – the incarceration of a parent is a relatively common event.  Incarceration clearly can have important impacts – separation of partners, transforming an intact family into single parent family,  diminished social and economic resources, and stigma which “spreads to people associated with inmates” (p. 217).  This paper examines the impact of incarceration of fathers on mothers’ mental health., Currently in theUS, “one in four black children can expect to have a parent imprisoned during their childhood” and the parent (most commonly the father) is likely to be “absent during key developmental periods of their children’s lives” (p. 218).   As a consequence, the incarceration of the father can affect children’s mental health which, itself, is likely to have a negative impact on the mother., The difficulty in evaluating the impact of the incarceration of the father of a child on the mother’s mental health is that “mothers who share children with incarcerated men may suffer from high levels of stress whether or not the father was incarcerated” in part, perhaps, because of the characteristics of men who are sent to prison.  Alternatively, mental illness, or “depression itself may be associated with mothers getting involved with incarcerated men” (p. 220)., This study examined the families of 3,826 children from a survey in which the parents (a disproportionate number of whom were identified as ‘at risk’) were interviewed when the child was 1, 3, and 5 years old.  Standard measures of maternal depression and life dissatisfaction were obtained from the mothers at the 3- and 5-year surveys. “Recent” paternal incarceration was defined as incarceration at least once between the 3- and 5-year surveys and characterized 20% of the sample.  Incarceration prior to the 3-year interview (39% of the sample) was defined as “distal” incarceration.  Various factors associated with paternal incarceration and maternal mental health were statistically controlled., Recent paternal incarceration was associated with a much greater risk of maternal depression.  Some – but not all – of the simple association could be explained by characteristics of the mother (e.g., that she had a parent who had experienced depression or she experienced material hardship), and an additional portion can be explained by characteristics of the father.  Nevertheless, the relationship of the recent incarceration of the father to depression in the mother was still significant.  The effect of the ‘recent’ incarceration held even for those who had been incarcerated prior to the 3-year interview, suggesting that the effect was not caused simply by characteristics of the mother or father., Conclusion:  Incarcerating a child’s father appears to have a causal link with the onset of depression in the mother. It does not appear to be solely a ‘selection’ effect.  Though changes in the quality of the relationship between the parents explained some of the effect of incarceration, changes in parenting experiences and economic well-being appear to be important in understanding why mothers whose partners are incarcerated are likely to suffer from major depression.  Mothers whose partners are incarcerated experience depression in large part because it “leads to financial instability among mothers, further deterioration of already vulnerable relationships, and growing parental stress” (p. 234)., Reference: Wildeman, Christopher, Jason Schnittker, and Kristin Turney (2012).

The 2003 Canadian Youth Criminal Justice Act may have been generally successful in two of its explicit goals (reducing the use of youth court and youth custody) but has not been successful in addressing two status-like offences (failing to comply with bail orders or with sentences).,"From 1984 onward, youths in Canada could not be brought to youth court for behaviour that was not also an offence if committed by an adult.  In other words, ‘status offences’ were officially eliminated.  However, what is normally non-criminal behaviour could be criminalized in two different ways: by prohibitions that were part of a bail order or conditions imposed as part of a sentence (e.g., as part of a probation order).  Hence, for example, ‘staying out late’ could be criminalized if a youth had a curfew imposed as part of a bail or probation order. Similarly, a youth could be detained in custody for not going to school if attending school was part of a bail order., Generally speaking, Canada’s 2003 youth justice law has accomplished its central goals of diverting minor cases from the youth court and reducing dramatically the use of custody (Criminological Highlights, V10N1#1, V10N3#1).  However, one exception to its success involves the two offences of failure to comply with an order (largely the violation of conditions of release on bail) and failure to comply with a disposition (or sentence).  These two offences together currently (2011) account for over 20% of all youths charged with criminal offences. Furthermore, although the rate (per 10,000 youths) of bringing youths to court from 1998 onwards declined for all offences and for minor property and minor assaults in particular, the rates of bringing youths to court for failing to comply with bail conditions or dispositions increased during this same period., Since 2003, under Canada’s Youth Criminal Justice Act, the number of guilty findings for all offences as well as minor property offences and minor assaults continued to decline.  This was not the case for failure to comply with bail conditions or dispositions. These have stayed the same or increased slightly.   The picture is very similar for custodial sentences:  the rate (per 10,000 youths) of the imposition of custodial sentences for all offences and for minor property crimes or minor assaults has continued to decline in recent years, but this is not the case for these two administration of justice offences., Data from one large Toronto court may help explain part of the problem.  The number of conditions placed on youths released on bail has steadily increased since 2005.  In addition, youths have increasingly been required – if they want to be released on bail – to sign documents allowing the police or others to monitor whether they are complying with ‘treatment’ orders or orders to attend school while on bail. Hence courts have not only ‘criminalized’ an increasing amount of normal behaviour, but they have increasingly required youths to make it easy for police to determine whether they are committing these ‘status offences.’, Girls’ youth court caseload is more likely than boys’ caseload to involve failure to comply with a disposition.  It also appears that girls are more likely than boys to fail to comply with their non-custodial sentences.  Similarly, girls are more likely (per 100 releases from pretrial detention) to be charged with failing to comply with bail orders than are boys., Conclusion: These two offences (failing to comply with bail orders or with dispositions) appear to be the exception – but a very large exception – to the general decline in the use of youth court and youth custody for minor offences.  It is also noteworthy that the reduction in the use of youth court for minor offences other than these two administration of justice offences can be traced directly to legislative provisions that explicitly encourage the use of non-court approaches for minor offences.  It would appear that a lesson can be learned from the relative success of other parts of the youth justice legislation: change is unlikely to occur unless legislation is enacted that addresses this growing part of the youth court caseload in Canada., Reference: Sprott, Jane B.

"In Los Angeles, California, during the 1930s and 1940s, Mexican-American boys who came before the juvenile court were less likely than white boys to be removed from their homes because court officials did not want to use expensive and scarce resources to try to rehabilitate them.",", In the first half of the 20th century there was an optimistic belief that “fatherly, compassionate judges and well-trained probation officers would assist parents in guiding their children through adolescence while simultaneously rooting out the causes of crime” (p. 194).  The assumption was that when families and the community failed, the court would act in the child’s best interest and remove the youth from the adverse environment., In Los Angeles in the 1930s, Mexican Americans “suffered regular discrimination; they were prohibited from certain whites-only parks and restaurants; and they were assigned mainly to segregated schools” (p. 196).  State, county, and federal governments attempted to deport and repatriate them and many were forced out of the country illegally.  However, interventions by courts into the lives of Mexican-American children were seen, by some, as a form of child welfare (i.e., a privilege extended to them). The view was sometimes expressed that Mexican-American families expected the courts to take care of their children and were unfairly taking advantage of being in the United States., During the 1930s and 1940s, Mexican-American children were disproportionately likely to be arrested by the police.  Whether this was due to higher rates of offending, more concentrated enforcement of minority neighbourhoods, or the use of discretion by the police in screening out white youths is not clear.  What is clear, however, is that when white and Mexican-American youths ended up in juvenile court in Los Angeles, white youths were considerably more likely to be given dispositions that involved them being removed from the family.  This held true even when age, family structure, whether they were receiving welfare, whether the youth was born in California, as well as the offence seriousness and prior involvement with the court were statistically controlled., In California during this time, “out-of-family placements – and the newly developed youth forestry camps in particular – were viewed as scarce commodities to be reserved, largely, for more ‘deserving’ white boys. “For a variety of reasons, correctional officials concluded that Mexican-American youth were unresponsive to the programming offered at their institutions, and that the presence of too many Mexican Americans detracted from the rehabilitative programming designed primarily for whites” (p. 210).  The lower likelihood of Mexican-American youths receiving a sentence of out-of-family placement, then, appears to be the result of conscious decisions to limit this group’s access to what were seen as beneficial services., Conclusion: Conclusion: Currently, the term “disproportionate minority confinement” of youths is a common enough problem that the acronym “DMC” is sometimes used, in the context of American juvenile justice, without the perceived need to explain either what the acronym stands for or its historically-specific origins and development. As the case of Mexican Americans in Los Angeles during the 1930s and 1940s illustrates, when out-of-home placements were still seen as a means of providing beneficial services to delinquent youths, minority boys were, at least in some courts, less likely than whites to be removed from their homes. These findings suggest that the present over-representation of minority youth in custodial institutions is related to the decline of the rehabilitative ideal and the greater association of out-of-home placement with punishment and incapacitation rather than treatment and rehabilitative services., Reference: Schlossman, Michael B.

The experience of racial discrimination by African Americans appears to be a cause of increased offending by members of this group.,", In the US, it is well established that African Americans are more likely than others to be involved in certain kinds of crime.  Higher rates of offending by African Americans are usually explained by structural differences (e.g., poverty, access to employment) between African Americans and others.  This paper examines the hypothesis that personal experiences of racial discrimination increase the likelihood that people will become involved in crime., In this study, African American families that included a Grade 5 child were recruited in two US states (Georgia and Iowa).  Youths started their involvement in the study at age 10-12 and ended when they were 17-20.  The number of different delinquent acts reported by the youth at age 17-20 was the focus of the study. 69% of youths reported involvement in at least one form of delinquency.  Youths’ experience with racial discrimination (e.g., “How often has someone said something insulting to you because of your race or ethnic background?) was assessed in their late adolescent years., In addition, various other measures thought to be affected directly by experiences of discrimination were assessed.  These included disengagement from conventional norms (how wrong the respondent saw certain deviant behaviours such as cheating on a test or criminal acts such as shoplifting to be), hostile views of relationships (e.g. agreement with questions like “When people are friendly, they usually want something from you”) and depression (whether the respondent felt sad, irritable, worthless, etc.)., Racial discrimination had direct effects on disengagement from conventional norms, hostile views of relationships, and depression.  Each of these factors, in turn, was associated with increased delinquency.  But in addition, experiencing racial discrimination had a direct effect on delinquency at age 17-20: those who had experienced discrimination reported higher levels of involvement in crime., The survey also included questions related to practices within the family that were designed to assess levels of cultural socialization the youth experienced (e.g., taking the child to places reflecting racial heritage; being encouraged to read books about the youth’s heritage) as well as questions related to practices of the adult family members in preparing youths for discrimination (e.g., talking about discrimination or prejudice, or talking about the possibility that people would treat the youth badly or unfairly).  Cultural socialization reduced the effect of racial discrimination on disengagement from conventional norms but this did not translate into less offending at age 17-20.   “Preparation for bias, on the other hand, significantly reduces the effects of discrimination on offending. It does so primarily by decreasing the effects of hostile views [of relationships], disengagement from norms, and depression on increased offending” (p. 665)., Conclusion: This study suggests that “interpersonal racial discrimination is an important source of offending among African Americans and thus [is] a contributor to racial disparities in crime” (p. 668).  But the study also highlights “the effects of preparation for bias, which protected against the criminogenic effects of discrimination” (p. 668).  Preparation for bias “largely operated to reduce negative behavioural responses rather than cognitive or affective ones” (p. 668).  Said differently, preparation for bias gave youths methods to cope in non-criminal ways with discrimination., Reference: Burt, Callie Harbin, Ronald L.

White Americans who believe that Black youths disproportionately commit crime and that whites are disproportionately the victims of violent crime are likely to believe that the youth justice system should be more punitive toward young offenders.,", Previous research has demonstrated that White Americans who perceive that they live in neighbourhoods with high concentrations of Blacks are more likely to report high levels of fear of crime (Criminological Highlights V1N1#7).  In addition, those White Americans who see Black Americans as responsible for a disproportionate amount of crime are most likely to be punitive (Criminological Highlights V7N1#5).  This paper explores the possibility that support for a more punitive youth justice system is concentrated among those who view Blacks as largely responsible for youth crime and who believe that Whites are disproportionately victims of violence., Youth justice systems in the US and in Canada have one important common element: they are based on the idea that youths who offend should be treated less harshly than adults who committed the same act.  Though most research suggests that Americans and Canadians favour retaining a separate youth justice system, there  is some support in each country for a harsher response to offending by youths.  This study examines data from 743 White respondents to a US national poll carried out in 2010., The main focus of the study was a set of 7 questions in which respondents indicated their level of support for specific punitive policies (e.g., “Trying more juveniles in adult courts”; “Making sentences more severe for juveniles who commit crimes”).  In addition, respondents were asked what they thought should be “the youngest age that we should allow someone who commits a violent offence to be tried as an adult.”  Respondents were asked two key variables related to race: “When you think about juveniles who commit crimes, approximately what percent would you say are White… Black… Latino?”  They were asked a similar question about victims of violent crime., The White respondents were not, overall, very punitive toward young offenders. Most of the respondents (63%) thought that youths under 16 were too young to be tried as adults.  In addition, most (81%) believed that it is generally possible to rehabilitate young offenders who have committed violent offences., However, even when controlling for characteristics of the community (e.g., employment rate of the community, crime rate) and of the individual (e.g., age, sex, education, income, perceived victimization risk, whether their household had been victimized), those who saw delinquency concentrated among Black youths and those who saw Whites as disproportionately likely to be victims of violent crime were more likely to hold punitive attitudes toward young offenders. Similarly, those who saw Blacks as disproportionately responsible for youth crime were more likely to favour trying younger youths as adults.  In other words, “among Whites, judgements about whether [young] offenders possess qualities that warrant a legal distinction between them and adult criminals are influenced by racial concerns” (p. 694)., Conclusion:  Although “White Americans are only modestly supportive of punitive juvenile justice policies” (p. 695), “racialized views of youth crime play an important role in shaping public opinion on juvenile justice…. Punitiveness toward juvenile offenders tends to be higher among both Whites who believe that Black youths commit a larger proportion of juvenile crime in comparison with White youths, and those who think that Whites account for a larger percentage of violent crime victims in comparison with Blacks”  (p. 697)., Reference: Pickett, Justin T. and Ted Chiricos (2012).  Controlling Other People’s Children: Racialized Views of Delinquency and Whites’ Punitive Attitudes Toward Juvenile Offenders.

People who view crime as being the result of personal choices of those who commit offences are likely to express high levels of anger about crime. Those who are angry about crime are likely to be more punitive toward offenders.,", About 12 years ago it was suggested that “the urge to punish the criminal is deep-seated and probably universal.  People want order and are antagonistic to those who break it. Thus, it is not surprising that those who appeal to these emotions are likely to be successful. Indeed, their approaches resonate with public wishes” (Criminological Highlights, V4N3#1)., This paper argues that those who believe crime is the result of rational decision making on the part of offenders are also likely both to believe that offenders should be punished more severely and to respond to crime with anger.  Furthermore, the emotion of anger in response to crime directly leads to the belief that offenders should receive harsh punishments., Canadians 18 years and older in 6 provinces were interviewed by telephone in 2005.  A scale of punitiveness toward offenders was created using respondents’ agreement with 7 separate proposals such as “make sentences more severe for all crimes”, “make prisoners work on chain gangs”, “take away TV and recreation privileges from prisoners”, and “send repeat juvenile offenders to adult courts”.   Fear was assessed by giving respondents 4 short scenarios (e.g., a house break-in) and asking them the degree to which each scenario made them fearful.  They were then asked how much each of these 4 situations made them angry.  Worry was assessed by asking questions such as “I worry about being robbed or assaulted in my own neighbourhood at night.”  Internal attributions of crime involved responses to 3 questions such as “Most criminals commit crimes because they know they can get away with it” (p. 459-461)., To estimate the relationships of internal attributions, anger, fear, and worry with punitiveness, various factors were statistically controlled, including political conservatism which, itself, was moderately related to punitive attitudes. Having been a victim of crime was unrelated to punitive attitudes. Above and beyond these control factors, those who made stronger internal attributions of crime (i.e., those who believe that offenders know exactly what they are doing when they commit crime) were more punitive. In addition, feelings of anger toward offenders and worry about being victimized in the future were each associated with punitive attitudes.  Above and beyond all of these factors ‘fear’ had no effect., Conclusion: Those reporting that scenarios about crime made them feel angry were more punitive in their views about how offenders should be treated, a finding consistent with previous research (Criminological Highlights V10N3#5).   Punitiveness was not associated, however, with being a victim, and after controlling for anger and worry about future crime, fear was not a significant predictor of punitive attitudes. However, the manner in which “individuals have conceptualized the reasons for crime appears to be a more important variable explaining punitive attitudes than emotions about crime” (p. 476).  But those who made internal attributions were angrier about crime.  It may be, therefore, that political rhetoric that conceptualizes crime as being solely the result of rational decisions by offenders, combined with rhetoric that legitimizes anger and worry in response to crime, may be an effective way of using crime policy to elicit political support., Reference: Hartnagel, Timothy F. and Laura J.

"Providing ordinary citizens with authoritative information about crime, the effect of harsh sentences, and mandatory minimum sentences appears to have an immediate impact on their general satisfaction with sentences and the courts. However, these effects are not long-lasting.",", In some western countries (e.g., Canada, the U.S., Australia), most residents, when asked to give their views about sentencing, tell pollsters that sentences are not harsh enough.  It has often been asserted – and sometimes demonstrated – that when people are given some information about sentences, their views of sentences become more moderate.  For example, when people are given information showing that having the death penalty does not reduce crime, there is an immediate reduction in support for the death penalty. However, a number of such studies suggest that the effect is not long lasting., Some have suggested that to achieve lasting impact, people need to engage with the information through discussion and deliberation.  However, little evidence exists that ‘once only’ engagement with issues surrounding sentencing will have lasting impact. In this study, the impact of discussion and deliberation about sentencing matters is examined over a relatively long time period (5-8 months)., A representative sample of 6005 Australian adults were interviewed (on the telephone) in 2008-9 (Time 1). They were asked questions about three aspects of sentencing: (1) their confidence in sentencing, (2) their preferences for harsh sentences, and (3) their willingness to accept alternatives to imprisonment for certain types of offenders.  Most of those interviewed agreed to be interviewed at a later time., Approximately 9 months later (Time 2) a random sample of 815 of this group were interviewed a second time (the ‘information session’).  They were provided information about the purposes of sentencing and given some sentencing scenarios, and then they were asked to indicate which purposes should guide sentences. Next, they were provided some key facts about sentencing (e.g., relative costs of prison and alternatives, the ineffectiveness of high imprisonment as a crime control technique, problems with mandatory minimum sentences).  They were also asked to consider the importance of these facts in directing policy (e.g., whether to build more prisons). Finally, they gave their views on the same three issues they had been questioned about 9 months earlier., About 7 months later (Time 3) these same people, and a randomly selected control group of people who had not been contacted for the (Time 2) ‘information session’ were interviewed.  The views of members of both groups were assessed using the same scales., The results are quite consistent across measures.  The immediate impact of the information deliberation at Time 2 was significant on all three measures. People expressed more moderate views after engaging with sentencing information and sentencing purposes.  However, at Time 3 – 7 months after people had been given information and had been induced to think about it – these moderating effects of information disappeared almost completely: “No substantial differences could be observed between the group exposed to the intervention and the control group some 6-9 months after the intervention” (p. 160)., Conclusion: It would appear that although information and deliberation about sentencing has an immediate impact, its effect is short lived, presumably, in part, because in many communities the assumption that harsh sentences are good is the dominant publicly expressed attitude. “Emotions of fear, anger, and disgust are… easy to elicit on topics of crime and punishment” (p. 161) and these emotions can lead to the expression of punitive attitudes toward sentencing.  But a focus on these emotions ignores the fact that, when engaged with the issue of sentencing, the public appears to have more moderate views., Reference: Indermaur, David, Lynne Roberts, Caroline Spiranovic, Geraldine Mackenzie and Karen Gelb (2012).

"When the fathers of children under 12 years old are imprisoned, there is an increased likelihood that these children will offend as adults.",", It is well established that children whose parents have committed criminal offences are, themselves, more likely to commit offences.  Thus it is hardly surprising that children whose fathers spent time in prison are more likely than other children to offend.  This paper allows an examination of the impact of imprisonment of fathers on their children while controlling for the criminal behaviour of the father., This study tracks 5,981 children who were born in the early 1970s and tracked until 2003. All of them had fathers who were convicted of a crime in the Netherlands in 1977.  Most of the fathers (59%) had been convicted of a crime but were never imprisoned.  The fathers of the others had been imprisoned at least once before the child reached 18.  The criminal convictions of the father may have taken place before the child was born, when the child was less than 12 years old, or between 12 and 18, or some combination of these., In an analysis without control variables, the imprisonment of the father was associated with a higher rate of offending (likelihood of offending each year after age 18) for both boys and girls.  It appears that the effect of the father’s imprisonment was largest when the father was imprisoned between the child’s birth and when the child was 12 years old., Some of the controls that were added – for example whether the parents separated at some point before the child turned 18 years old – could well be, in part, a consequence of imprisonment of the father.  Nevertheless, adding various controls – the offending history of the father, whether the parents separated, whether the father was born outside of the country, whether the child was born when the mother was under 20 years old – reduced, but did not eliminate the impact of the father’s imprisonment.  “Children whose father was imprisoned between ages 0 and 12 thus have a significantly higher chance of a conviction, even after accounting for the father’s criminal history (and other family characteristics) compared to children whose fathers never went to prison” (p. 98)., The impact of the imprisonment of the father was significant, but rather small in size once the offending history of the father had been taken into account.  One possible explanation for the small effect is that during the period of the study “the Netherlands had a history of an extended social welfare system and… a relatively mild penal climate with relatively low prison populations” (p. 101)., Conclusion: The finding of a small but measurable effect of imprisonment of the father on the offending rate of his children when they are young adults is consistent with the growing literature on the effects of imprisonment on the families of those imprisoned (Criminological Highlights V12N6#7, V12N6#8).  These findings, combined with those showing that imprisonment can increase the likelihood of future offending by those imprisoned (Criminological Highlights V11N1#1, V11N1#2), suggest that any presumed incapacitative impacts of imprisonment need to be assessed in the context of possible increases in criminal activity of those imprisoned and the family of the prisoner., Reference: Van de Rakt, Marike, Joseph Murray, and Paul Nieuwbeerta (2012).

"During some periods of American history, high rates of deportations of non-citizen criminals were associated with high rates of unemployment.  This relationship held only when three factors were in place:  law enforcement resources were available, the law made it relatively easy to deport, and judges had the power to control whether or not noncitizen offenders were to be deported.",", In 2009, the US deported approximately two hundred thousand non-citizen criminals. As a proportion of all deportations, criminal deportations were relatively rare before the 1980s except during the Great Depression years. However, from the 1980s onwards, criminal deportations increased dramatically. The result of high deportation rates means that “approximately 1.6 million US residents are now separated from a spouse or child due to criminal deportation” (p. 1787)., Some have argued that the style of punishment generally, and the rate of deportation in particular, may be determined, in part, by the need for inexpensive labour.  The issue of what to do with illegal immigrants is, of course, related to general views of immigration.  This paper, then, examines the deportation of criminals in the context of policies and discourse on labour and immigration., This paper divides the past century into three periods. From 1908 until 1940, there was the slow development of laws related to the deportation of non-US citizens, though “for most of this period, the social and political desire to expel criminals and ‘immoral classes’ was widespread” (p. 1795).  From 1941 to 1986, we see the beginning of active controls on non-citizens.  Non-citizens were required to be registered in 1940 and “by 1941 the machinery of deportation was effectively in place” (p. 1796). This machinery included a list of deportable offences. Nevertheless, during this period of time, judges could decide on a case-by-case basis whether a particular offender should be deported, thus allowing them to ameliorate the impact of the prosecution if there were extenuating circumstances.  The period 1987-2005 was very different. Harsh and rigid criminal justice penalty systems were being developed and the deportation bureaucracy was well established.  These would be expected to increase numbers of deportations (which indeed did occur), but to reduce the relationship between unemployment and deportations (since judges did not have the power to block the deportation)., From 1908 until 1940, changes in unemployment had no relationship to changes in the number of criminal deportations, even though criminal deportations were up, in general, during the Great Depression.  This may have happened because the deportation apparatus was underdeveloped and hence unable to respond to any external pressures.  In the period 1940-1986, when there was “relative stability in the deportation law [and] a larger federal law enforcement bureaucracy and judicial discretion, unemployment emerges as a strong predictor of criminal deportation” (p. 1811). For most years during this period when there was a spike in unemployment, there was also a spike in deportations. In this period, it appears (from a count of the number of New York Times stories on employment, immigration, and labour each year) that discourse on immigration and labour rose in times of high unemployment and this increased salience of the issue may account for part of the relationship between unemployment and criminal deportations. During the final period (1987-2005), changes in unemployment had no apparent relationship to the number of criminal deportations., Conclusion: Rates of unemployment and criminal deportations are clearly linked, but only when laws, bureaucratic processes, and judicial discretion allow it.  In recent years, with substantial resources focused on the deporting of non-citizen offenders and a diminished ability of judges to have an impact on deportations, the relationship between unemployment and criminal deportations essentially disappeared., Reference: King, Ryan D., Michael Masssaglia, and Christopher Uggen (2012).

The length of time an offender spends in prison on the first prison sentence has no discernible impact on the likelihood that he or she will reoffend.,"There are theoretical reasons to believe that the time that an offender spends in prison could either increase or decrease the likelihood of reoffending. If time in prison were to convince offenders that the risks of offending are too high, long prison sentences could reduce offending.  Alternatively, long periods of time in prison could increase subsequent offending by reinforcing deviant values, stigmatizing the offender, and/or making it more difficult for the offender to obtain legitimate employment upon release., This study investigates the impact of the length of time in prison on reoffending in a three year period after release for a group of Dutch offenders sentenced to prison for the first time in 1997.  All were under 40 years old, and were convicted of violent, property, or drug offences. In order to control for differences between those getting longer and shorter sentences, two somewhat independent techniques were used.  First, the 4,683 offenders were divided into four groups according to the best estimate of their predicted ‘trajectories’ of offending at the time of sentencing. Second, pairs of offenders receiving ‘long’ and ‘short’ sentences were matched on various other measures (age, sex, whether the offender was an immigrant, 9 different measures of past criminal convictions, and various measures of the seriousness of the offence for which they were being sentenced).  In the end, 4,096 offenders were successfully matched.  Those excluded were largely those with extremely long or short sentences.  Most importantly, the matched pairs were always of the same age and sex and were in the same offending trajectory group., Offenders were divided into 5 groups according to the time that they served, running from ‘less than one month’ to ‘more than one year’.  Dutch prison terms are short as compared to the US, but comparable to those in Northern Europe and Canada. 86% of the sentences in this sample were under a year, a figure which is comparable to overall Canadian sentences (89% under 1 year)., The findings are easy to describe. When adequate controls were imposed on the comparisons, pairs of similar offenders with different sentence lengths did not differ in reoffending.  Two measures were used: the felony reconviction rate and the proportion reconvicted (one or more times) within three years.  Essentially, the data show that the length of time in prison (ranging from under a month to over a year) had no effect on reconviction.  It is important to note, however, that without any controls, those receiving long sentences looked somewhat less likely to reoffend.  It is easy to understand why: those receiving long sentences were very different from those receiving shorter sentences on many dimensions related to reoffending. What is important, however, is that when age, offending trajectory and a large number of other important controls are introduced, there was essentially no consistent impact of time in prison on offending.  Said differently, when cases that are similar on relevant dimensions are compared, time in prison has no discernible impact on reoffending., Conclusion: Previous research suggests that sending an offender to prison rather than imposing a community punishment may be criminogenic (see Criminological Highlights, 11(1)#2).  For those who are imprisoned for the first time, the length of time in prison appears to be irrelevant to future offending.  Obviously prison sentence length is going to vary for reasons other than likelihood of reoffending (e.g., for the purpose of achieving proportionality).  These data, however, suggest that judges, when sentencing an offender to a first prison sentence, should not vary the sentence length because of a belief that sentence length affects reoffending., Reference:  Snodgrass, G.

"National imprisonment rates vary dramatically but, generally speaking, they reflect the political and social values of each country.",", Imprisonment rates of European and English-speaking countries vary dramatically.   According to 2007 imprisonment data, the rates in Nordic countries are very low and vary from 55 prisoners per one hundred thousand residents in Iceland to 78 in Sweden.  At the other end of the spectrum, the Eastern European countries have relatively high rates (e.g., 212 in Poland, 206 in the Czech Republic, 319 in Latvia), but not as high as that of Russia (592) or the USA (760).  This study looks at imprisonment rates in 30 countries in Europe and three countries (Canada, Australia, New Zealand) outside of Europe.  The US and Russia were not included in the analysis., Generally speaking, reported crime, victimization rates, and the rate of non-traffic criminal convictions were unrelated to imprisonment rates.  Homicide rates were positively correlated with imprisonment rates, but to a large extent this was due to three outliers (Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania), all of which had high homicide rates and high imprisonment rates. If the other 27 countries are looked at, there is very little relationship. But to suggest that this may be a causal relationship between high homicide rates and high imprisonment rates ignores the possibility that a third factor – such as social policies - may be responsible for both high homicide rates and high imprisonment rates., When looking at social policy indicators, the picture is quite consistent.  Those countries with relatively low levels of economic disparity have relatively low imprisonment rates.  Those countries that spend more funds on social welfare concerns (expressed as percent of gross domestic product or in the number of Euros spent per person on social welfare matters) tend to have low imprisonment rates.  Similarly, those countries that score high on measures of actual welfare, well-being, and prosperity in various areas of life have low imprisonment rates. Those countries in which citizens indicate that they have high levels of trust in their fellow citizens, the police, the justice system, and their parliament tend to have low imprisonment rates. Finally, countries in which the national government operates largely by consensus – in contrast with a simple ‘winner takes all’ majority rule – tend to have low imprisonment rates., As with research on individual preferences for high imprisonment policies, countries in which large portions of the population feel unsafe and with high proportions of people who report intolerance toward  various groups, including offenders, tend to be countries with high rates of imprisonment., Conclusion: Imprisonment rates should not be seen as being an accident of a country’s criminal justice policies; they appear to reflect values and approaches to governing within each country.  “Prison rates (and social policy) are an outcome of policy choices and political actions” (p. 318).  “Moderate penal policies have their roots in a consensual and corporatist political culture, in high levels of social trust and political legitimacy, and in a strong welfare state…. Consensual politics lessens controversies, produces less crisis talk, inhibits dramatic about-turns and sustains long-term consistent policies. In other words, consensual democracies are less susceptible to political populism” (p. 321-2)., Reference: Lappi-Seppälä, Tapio (2011).  Explaining Imprisonment in Europe.  European Journal of Criminology 8 (4), 303-328., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV12N3.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-12-no-3-%E2%80%93-january-2012,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 12, No. 3 – January 2012",Regular Issue,2012
Very intensive foot patrols by police can have an impact on street crime.,", Police foot patrols have been seen as a popular way to address crime, though the evidence that they actually deter crime has been weak. The public appears to believe that if there is an officer on foot patrol in their neighbourhood, they will be safe.  From a management perspective, foot patrols are expensive. If, however, foot patrols are used selectively to target crime “hotspots” – locations where crime rates (or street crime in particular) are high – it has been suggested that they may be especially effective., Unlike some studies that looked at relatively large geographic areas, this study examined the impact of intensive police foot patrols on street crime using a large number of small geographic areas.  Crime hotspots were identified, in early 2009 in Philadelphia, by looking at the number of homicides, aggravated assaults, and robberies that had occurred outdoors in recent years.  In all, 120 hotspots were located, each including at least one of the most violent street corners in the city. These hotspots had an average of 14.7 intersections and 1.3 miles of streets. These 120 hotspots were then divided into 60 pairs of hotspots with similar numbers of violent incidents.  One of each pair was then randomly determined to be a ‘control’ hotspot (with no special change in police patrol intensity). The other received intensive patrols for 12 weeks in addition to normal policing.  The intensive patrols consisted of 2-person foot patrols for 12 weeks from 10a.m. until 2 a.m.,  5 days a week (Tuesday morning to early Sunday morning).  In all, then, 57,600 hours of 2-person police patrol (115,200 person-hours) were used during the 12 week period in the 60 intensive patrol hotspot areas. The activities of the police officers varied considerably across areas in terms of the number of recorded pedestrian and vehicle stops, arrests, and recorded disturbances and drug-related disorder., Overall, there was a slight reduction in the average number of violent crimes recorded in the experimental areas, compared to the average number before the intensive foot patrols (a reduction of about 0.88 crimes per area during the 12 week period).  In the control areas, there was a slight increase in the number of crimes during the ‘treatment’ period, as compared to the earlier period (0.52).   However, this apparent relative reduction only occurred in the highest crime areas. These were the areas, not surprisingly, in which the foot patrol officers were most likely to have direct contact with citizens as a result of arrests or responding to various forms of disorder.  In the relatively low crime areas (which were, of course, hotspots relative to the city as a whole), the patrols had essentially no impact on crime., However, it would appear that some of the violent crime reduction in the intensive foot patrol areas was a result of displacement to adjacent areas.  It was estimated that 90 violent crimes were averted in the target areas as a result of the intensive foot patrols, but an estimated 37 of these crimes were displaced to adjacent areas. Thus there were an estimated 53 fewer crimes as a result of the intervention, or one crime for every 1087 hours of 2-person patrols (or 2174 person-hours of patrol)., Conclusion:  It would appear that highly intensive policing can modestly reduce the number of violent crimes that take place in an area.  In part because the effect is small and is limited to the very highest crime areas, it is difficult to know whether to attribute the drop in crime to the mere presence of a police officer in the area or to the activities of the police in the neighbourhood. The data would suggest that it may be that foot patrols can only deter violent street crime in very violent areas.  However, the investment of police time for each crime averted was non-trivial., Reference: Ratcliffe, Jerry H., Travis Taniguchi, Elizabeth R.

"When youths are apprehended and arrested for offences, their perceptions of the likelihood of being caught in the future increase – but not very much.",", Much of the popular and academic interest in deterrence has to do with general deterrence, or reductions in crime (by people other than the offender) through harsher penalties. General deterrence, however, has been shown largely to be ineffective. But punishments may be effective in other ways.  Specifically, it may be that catching and arresting people for offences will reduce their future offending by increasing their assessments of the likelihood that they will be caught and arrested should they offend in the future.  In other words, a criminal justice system that is good at catching offenders may teach them, in effect, that crime does not pay.  This study looks into this possibility with a sample of adolescents who had been found guilty of relatively serious offences in either of two U.S. counties., These adolescents were interviewed once every 6 months for three years starting when they were, on average, about 16.5 years old.  Among other things, they were asked how likely it was that they would be caught and arrested if they were to commit each of seven different crimes ranging in seriousness from ‘stealing clothes from a store’ and ‘vandalism’ to ‘robbery with a gun’ and ‘stabbing someone’ (p. 652). They were also asked to report how many times, if any, they had committed each of 22 offences.  Arrests were recorded from juvenile court records in the two locations.  The focus of the study was on the youths’ estimates of the probability of being apprehended as a function of whether they had been caught for any offences they had committed during this period., Overall, the findings showed that the youth’s estimate, during any six month period, of being apprehended for offending was a function of two things: the youth’s perception of being apprehended prior to that period and whether the youth had been apprehended for offending during the previous six months.  Overall, if a youth committed a crime, the youth’s estimate of being apprehended increased by 6.3% if the youth had been arrested compared to if they had not.  It would appear that arrests for one type of crime (aggressive crimes) also affected respondents’ perceptions that they would be apprehended for income-generating offences, though this effect is slightly smaller. In other words, there was some evidence that the impact of an arrest was not crime specific.  Overall the data show that although the youths did change their subjective estimate of being apprehended, there was a good deal of variability in whether and how much updating of these estimates actually took place., Conclusion: It appears that “even among serious offending juveniles, an arrest still has a potential deterrent effect, at least as far as increasing risk perceptions. However, among more experienced or frequent offenders, this gain from deterrence may be reduced or, in some cases, lost all together” (p. 691).  There was, however, a great deal of individual variability. Thus it cannot be assumed that apprehension and arrest is, for all youths, a crime reducing strategy.  It is difficult, moreover, to estimate how much impact the changes in perception (of apprehension) may have on actual offending. One study found that a 10% change in the perceived likelihood of apprehension reduced offending by approximately 3% to 8% depending on the offence. Applying these findings to the present results would suggest that the impact of an arrest would be quite modest – reducing offending through individual deterrence by between 1.2% and 3.2%., Reference: Anwar, Shamena and Thomas A. Loughran (2011). Testing a Bayesian Learning Theory of Deterrence Among Serious Juvenile Offenders.

"Most active and violent offenders don’t think that they will be caught or have no idea what punishment to expect from their crimes if they were to be caught.  More severe sentences would, therefore, have no impact on their likelihood of offending.",", Those who suggest that harsher sentences would reduce crime appear to endorse the economic model that, in general, potential offenders make decisions that are informed by evidence of the consequences of what would happen to them if they were apprehended. However, for the consequences (e.g., the severity of the sentence) to make a difference, the offender, at the time of the offence, must both be thinking that there is a plausible chance of being caught and  know what the likely punishment would be., In this study, 278 prison inmates were asked questions about the offence that got them in prison.  Specifically, they were asked “When you committed this crime, how likely did you think it was that you would be caught?” This was answered on a 4 point scale ranging from ‘very likely’ to ‘I did not think I would get caught’ plus the alternative ‘I did not think about it.’   They were also asked “When you committed the crime, did you know what the likely punishment would be if you were caught?”  Again, a four point scale was used ranging from ‘I knew exactly what the punishment would be’ to ‘I had no idea or thought I knew but was wrong’, plus the alternative ‘I didn’t think about it’ (p. 303).  By interviewing only those apprehended and punished rather severely, one obviously misses those who were not apprehended or imprisoned.   However, the purpose of this study is “to determine to what extent current offenders could be dissuaded by more severe sentencing” (p. 301)., Overall, 42% of the 278 offenders indicated that they did not think about whether or not they would be caught and an additional 34% did not think they would be caught or thought it was not likely.   When asked what they thought the punishment would be at the time they were committing the crime, 35% indicated that they didn’t think about it, and an additional 18% had no idea or later found out that they were wrong.  In total 76% of these prisoners were oblivious to the fact that they might get caught or what the penalty would be (or both).  Raising penalties could not be expected to affect their behaviour., Said differently, 76% of the offenders were “lacking at least one of the necessary conditions for making a rational response to punishments.  This group would be unable to make informed, systematic decisions about their crimes.  Furthermore, [the survey demonstrates that] 89% of those convicted of crimes involving death of the victim, 91% of sex offenders, and 88% of robbers “may lack the requirements necessary to make informed, rational judgements and to respond as intended to harsher punishment” (p. 305)., Conclusion:  “The research suggests that the popular strategy of addressing crime with adjustments in the penal code is unlikely to provide substantial reductions in crime rates and that solutions to the… crime burden must involve a new emphasis on alternative deterrents.  The findings speak against more severe sentencing, not for emotional reasons, but because most current criminals do not have the information or mindset required to respond to these incentives for compliance” (p. 308).   For example, 89% of the most violent offenders were not thinking about the possibility of apprehension or the likely punishments associated with their crimes., Reference: Anderson, David A.

The development of ‘new and better’ community sanctions is unlikely to reduce prison populations unless a serious commitment to reforming sentencing occurs as well.,", England, in recent years, has begun to tackle its growing prison population, in part by attempting “to persuade sentencers, and the public, that community sentences are credible enough to use in place of some custodial sentences….” (p. 2).  This move was prompted by a growth in prison populations  that “could not be explained by increased crime or seriousness of offending” (p. 5).  Between 1998 and 2008, the number of people subject to community sanctions increased by 10%, but the prison population increased by a third.  Findings such as this lead many to question whether a growth in the use of community sanctions will necessarily lead to a reduction in imprisonment., Part of the problem with community sanctions is there are conditions attached to them, the violation of which can put the offender in custody.   With large numbers of conditions and increased enforcement of these conditions, breaches also increased dramatically during this period: there was a 470% increase in imprisonment for breach of non-custodial sentences between 1995 and 2009.   Not surprisingly, in this context, “all indications suggest that the growth in the use of community based sentences had a marginal displacement effect on custody” (p. 10).   Part of the reason that community based sentences may not reduce imprisonment is that imposing a community sanction on an offender may lead eventually to a prison sentence because many of the conditions of a community sanction have a high likelihood of being breached., Between 2004 and 2009, prison admissions for sentences of less than a year decreased by about 2,000 people (or 3%).  However, about 40,000 more offenders began a ‘suspended sentence order’ in 2009 than in 2004. In addition, the number of short prison sentences combined with a community based sentence increased dramatically.  At best, the promotion of community sentences beginning around 2005 may have stopped the increased use of short prison sentences, rather than causing a reduction in the use of prison., Conclusion:  This is not a new story.  The fact that a sanction is designed to keep offenders out of prison does not mean it will be successful in doing so, especially if the conditions are likely to be broken and offenders are likely to be imprisoned as a result.  “The data in this paper have told a clear story of the failure for those concerned with prison reduction…. It is not clear that a strong case for community sentence promotion as a mechanism [to address prison population size] exists…. There may be other valid reasons for supporting community sentences, such as a commitment to their potential rehabilitative ideal.  However, the evidence presented here suggests that the promotion and reform of community sentences will not fundamentally realize a longer-term vision for a significantly different, reduced custodial population” (p. 16).   It would appear, as one senior official suggested, that “What we have to think about is recalibrating our expectations about what sentencing is supposed to achieve” (p. 15)., Reference: Mills, Helen.

The gap between the earnings of Black and White Americans increases after imprisonment.,", It is well established that those with criminal records have difficulty finding work after being incarcerated, and these effects may be greater for Blacks than Whites (Criminological Highlights 6(3)#2).  Similarly, youths who have been incarcerated rather than being given community sanctions are less likely to be in the workforce after their sentences have been served (Criminological Highlights 11(4)#4).  And the increase in wages that occurs as people gain more experience in the workforce is lower for those who have been imprisoned than for comparable people who have not been imprisoned (Criminological Highlights, 5(3)#7)., This study looks at the impact of imprisonment on the gap between the earnings of Black and White offenders, all of whom were imprisoned.  Because being imprisoned is, in general, harmful to employment and income prospects, it is possible that the difference between the wages earned by Black and White Americans would decrease, since both groups would be, as a result of imprisonment, equally stigmatized.  Alternatively, there could be a multiplicative effect: being Black and being an ex-prisoner may be more harmful than would be expected if the two effects had independent negative impacts on wages., This study looked at the wages earned in legitimate work by Black and White residents of the State of Washington before and after they were incarcerated.  Specifically, wages (the average hourly wage when the person was working) for at least two years prior to incarceration in a Washington prison and for two years after release from prison were examined. Data were derived from state employment records.  If an offender was re-incarcerated, wages only to that point were examined., During the two years prior to incarceration, Blacks tended to earn less than Whites.  After incarceration, however, the gap between Black hourly wages and White hourly wages not only still existed; it increased over time. This effect – a widening gap between the hourly wages of Black and White workers after incarceration – occurred even when various other factors were controlled (e.g., employment history, education, offence type, length of incarceration, age).  For example, work history prior to incarceration has an impact on wages, but the difference between Black and White workers remains. Interestingly, however, the impact of work history on wages (for both Black and White workers) is less after incarceration than before, suggesting that a favourable work history does not help those who have been incarcerated as much as it does those who have not been imprisoned., Conclusion:  As people get older, their earnings tend to increase. However, “after release from prison, … the rate of growth is slight, and post-release wage growth is even slower for Blacks than for Whites.  Black wages increase, on average, about 21 percent slower than Whites each quarter after release” (p. 273).  The exact reasons for this could not be discerned from this study.  Clearly, however, incarceration – especially for Black Americans – “inhibits labour market prospects and other life-course transitions… [This study] points to the compound disadvantage faced by Black relative to White ex-inmates” (p. 273)., Reference: Lyons, Christopher J. and Becky Pettit (2011).

Prosecutorial evidence against a person whose face looks trustworthy is not as persuasive as exactly the same evidence used against a person whose face is not seen as being trustworthy.,", One traditional justification for deferring to judges and juries on questions of the credibility of witnesses in court is that judges and juries are able to observe the witness. The theory seems to be that by observing the demeanour of witnesses, people can determine whether they are telling truth. Evidence, however, suggests that ordinary people and even trained police officers are not very good at determining whether someone is telling the truth (Criminological Highlights 2(6)#8, 5(4)#5).  The focus on cues from people’s faces when they are giving evidence ignores, however, the possibility that some people simply look more trustworthy than others. In other words, observers of court hearings may be drawing inferences about the guilt of an accused simply from what he looks like, whether he testifies or not., A group of university students rated each of 20 photographs of white males exhibiting neutral expressions.  The people in each photograph were rated on a number of dimensions including attractiveness, kindness, and trustworthiness. Two photographs were chosen – the one rated as being most trustworthy and the one rated as being the least trustworthy., A new set of university students was given two trial vignettes. Each vignette was accompanied by one of the photographs (counterbalanced across participants such that each vignette was equally likely to be paired with each of the photographs). There were four vignettes in total: two involving serious crimes (a robbery-murder and a sex-offence-murder) and two involving less serious crimes (a fraud and a car theft).  The prosecutor’s evidence was presented to the study participants one item at a time.  They were asked after each piece of evidence had been presented whether they were, at that point, convinced of the accused person’s guilt., There were no differences attributable to the rated trustworthiness of the person depicted in the photographs associated with the less serious crimes.  In other words, for the less serious crime, the same amount of evidence was necessary to convince people that the accused was guilty when the accused looked trustworthy as when he looked untrustworthy.  However, for the serious crimes (involving murder), more prosecutorial evidence was necessary to convince participants of the accused’s guilt when the accused looked trustworthy (5.9 pieces of evidence) than when the accused looked untrustworthy (4.2 pieces of evidence).  Said differently, it would appear that compared to someone who ‘looks trustworthy’, ordinary people are willing to infer guilt on less evidence when an accused has facial characteristics that, in our culture, make him look untrustworthy., Conclusion: This study suggests that men whose faces make them look untrustworthy may be disadvantaged at their trials or perhaps when the police are looking for suspects for a crime. Quite independent of what the evidence is, people appear to draw inferences about what kind of person someone is from the physical characteristics of their faces. Participants in an experiment were more likely to conclude, on the basis of incomplete evidence against an accused, that he was guilty if he appeared to have an untrustworthy face than if he was perceived to be trustworthy, even though the objective evidence against the two accused was the same.  That this effect appeared only in the most serious cases (murders), suggests that in less serious crimes, people may attend more to the evidence rather than drawing inferences from the physical characteristics of the accused., Reference: Porter, Stephen, Leanne ten Brinke and Chantal  Gustaw (2010).  Dangerous Decisions: The Impact of First Impressions of Trustworthiness on the Evaluation of Legal Evidence and Defendant Culpability.  Psychology, Crime & Law, 16(6), 477-491., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV12N3.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-12-no-3-%E2%80%93-january-2012,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 12, No. 3 – January 2012",Regular Issue,2012
Youth courts can affect youths’ perceptions of the legitimacy of the law: keeping people waiting without explanation and general rude behaviour on the part of court personnel lead youths to be more likely to conclude that the courts don’t deserve their respect and that there is no reason to obey the law.,"Courts in Canada have rules that appear to be designed to induce respect.  Courts can order people to appear before them even if nothing is likely to happen at the court hearing.  They can punish people who are late to court. They typically require people to stand up when a judicial officer enters the room to demonstrate, one assumes, respect for the judicial officer.  And they require people to behave in particular ways (e.g., removing hats or caps) that are not normally required. This study examines the manner in which courts undermine their own legitimacy and lead youths to believe - among other things - that they should not try to obey the laws., Researchers in a large youth court in Toronto systematically observed, during a 9-month period, the ‘atmosphere’ in a ‘first appearance’ court, presided over by a Justice of the Peace. The ordinary events on each day were coded as being ‘standard’ or ‘sub-standard’.  A standard rating would involve such things as the court starting on time, no confusion about the court process, court personnel having the appropriate documents for the case that was called, “the justice of the peace clearly and courteously [explaining] the court process and/or issues in the case to the youth and/or the parents” (p. 534)., Events which would contribute to the day being described as ‘substandard’ would include an extremely late court starting time, delays caused by the absence of court staff when court was in session, “justice of the peace makes humiliating comments about the attire worn by the youth”,  “Crown attorney rolls eyes and impatiently sighs at youth when the youth is trying to explain an issue” or “court clerks yell out into the body of the court making excessive comments about what is allowed when court is already in session.”  As such, the observed phenomenon – court atmosphere - was neither elicited by, nor necessarily directed at, any particular accused youth.  It was simply that there were some ‘good’ and some ‘bad’ days in court.  Youths, then, were exposed to a ‘good’ or ‘bad’ day in court essentially randomly.  This study then examined the impact of good vs. bad days in court on youths., Youths were asked – by a researcher who was not responsible for the coding of ‘court atmosphere’ – about two aspects of their experience.  First they were asked about procedural justice (see Criminological Highlights 4(4)#1, 7(1)#4) – how they felt they, themselves, were treated by their own lawyer, the Crown attorney, and the Justice of the Peace presiding over the court.   Second, they were asked about the legitimacy of the justice system by assessing their agreement with statements such as “In general, our laws make Canada a better place”, “People are treated fairly by the Canadian courts”, “People should support the decisions made within the Canadian courts”, “I try to obey the laws” (p. 536)., Not surprisingly, the youths’ ratings of their own treatment affected their views of the legitimacy of the court: those who didn’t think that they were treated fairly rated the legitimacy of the court lower than those who thought that their treatment was fair.  However, both for youths who thought that they themselves were treated fairly and for youths who did not, experiencing a ‘substandard’ court day reduced significantly the rating of the legitimacy of the court. In other words, compared to those youths who were in court on a ‘good day’, youths who experienced ‘bad days’ in court were more likely to indicate that they saw no reason to obey the law or support the decisions of the court. Said differently, when courts misbehave, youths are less likely to believe that they should respect the law or the courts., Conclusion: If courts want youths to respect them, it would appear that it is necessary for them to act in a manner that deserves respect.  Courts that treat people in a disrespectful manner by starting late, taking “15 minute breaks” that last 45 minutes, and allow court personnel to act rudely to those in court, get the respect that they deserve.  More importantly, however, they teach youths that the law and the courts are not worth obeying., Reference: Greene, Carolyn, Jane B.

Community Service Orders are more effective at reducing recidivism than short sentences of imprisonment.,", In The Netherlands, community service has been an increasingly popular alternative to prison sentences of less than 6 months.  Dutch law initially allowed community service to be substituted for short prison sentences, and subsequently encouraged its use as a sanction in its own right. Simple comparisons of the recidivism rates of those who received prison sentences and those who received community service orders suggest that being sent to prison increases recidivism.  This paper improves on this previous research by creating comparable groups of offenders, half of whom were sentenced to prison and half of whom received sentences of community service., The challenge in a study of this kind is to create two groups of people who are as similar as possible on all characteristics except for the sentence they received.  Often this is done by finding pairs of people who, on variables known to relate to recidivism, are identical except for the fact that one went to prison and the other was sentenced to community service.  An alternative approach is to create an overall measure of the likelihood of receiving community service (using all of the background information that is available) and then matching on this ‘propensity score’ those who actually received community service with those who were sent to prison. This study did both, using offenders sentenced in The Netherlands in 1997.  In other words, they took pairs of people whose backgrounds would appear to make them equally likely to have received community service, but only one actually did.  In addition, they matched on age, sex, and the relative length of the sentence (in hours of community service and months of imprisonment). Offenders could receive up to 240 hours of community service or 6 months in prison. Only those offenders who had never before been sentenced to either community service or prison were included in the study to ensure that there could be no ‘carry over’ effects from previous experience with either of these sanctions., Recidivism measures – mean yearly conviction rates – were calculated for periods of time of 1, 3, 5, and 8 years (correcting statistically for the portion of each follow-up period that the offender was actually ‘at risk’ in the community).   The results are easy to describe: those who were sentenced to prison had higher recidivism rates (average annual rate of convictions) at each of the four time intervals. This pattern – higher recidivism for those sent to prison – was found for all crime, and separately for property crimes and violent crimes.  For example, looking at the five year follow-up period, those sentenced to prison were convicted of an average of 0.52 offences per year, whereas those sentenced to community service were convicted of only 0.28 offences per year, Conclusion: The results are similar to results from other studies (see Criminological Highlights 3(4)#4, 11(1)#1, 11(1)#2): sending offenders to prison for the first time for periods of up to six months rather than imposing community service on them appears to increase the likelihood of subsequent offending. “In the short term as well as in the long term, community service is followed by less recidivism than imprisonment… The absolute difference in recidivism after community service and imprisonment is 1.21 convictions after a follow-up period of five years” (p. 346).  In 2008, 81% of the 86,717 offenders (or 70,353 offenders) sentenced to prison in Canada received sentences of less than 6 months.  Not all of these 70,353 offenders would have met the criteria for this study since some of them had already experienced either imprisonment or a community service order.  But these data would suggest that the alternative – up to 240 hours of community service – would have been an effective way (in terms of costs and recidivism) of being tough on crime., Reference: Wermink, Hilde, Arjan Blokland, Paul Nieuwbeerta, Daniel Nagin, and Nikolaj Tollenaar (2010).  Comparing the Effects of Community Service and Short-Term Imprisonment on Recidivism: A Matched Samples Approach.  Journal of Experimental Criminology, 6, 325-349., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV11N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-11-no-5-%E2%80%93-january-2011,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 11, No. 5 – January 2011",Regular Issue,2011
Parole revocations make a major contribution to prison populations but the decision to send a parolee back to prison is determined by factors above and beyond the nature of their parole violations.,", The size of a prison population is obviously a function of the number of people admitted to prison, the length of the sentence, and decisions on when to release offenders (e.g., on parole).   But prison populations are also affected by decisions by parole boards to return parolees to prison, often for technical violations. In California, there are more parolees readmitted to prison each year than there are new felon admissions., This study examines the determinants of parole board decisions to return parolees to prison in 2003 and 2004 in California. Three different types of cases are examined: cases in which there was an allegation of a criminal offence but either the case was not referred to court or the parolee was not convicted but the case was, nevertheless, referred to the parole board; cases in which there was a technical violation of a condition of release; and cases in which the accused absconded from parole supervision.  Overall 72% of the cases resulted in an order to return to prison (69% in criminal cases, 82% in the case of technical violations, and 83% in absconding cases)., Three different sets of explanatory variables were examined: characteristics of the offender (and offence history), the occupancy rate of the California state prison reception centre in the month that the parole board was making its decision about a parolee,  and an index of the ‘punitiveness’ of the county in which the parolee lived. This last measure was calculated from political party membership and voting patterns on two ballot propositions (in 2000 and 2004) related to criminal sanctioning.  The effects of various ‘case’ factors were controlled statistically in all analyses.  These other factors included the seriousness of the criminal and technical violation, how many times the offender had been previously returned to prison, the original offence and the parolee’s age when first imprisoned., Above and beyond the various controls and the seriousness of the violations, those charged with technical violations or criminal offences were more likely to be returned if they had been labelled as a serious violent offender or they were a registered sex offender. This appears to reflect the fact that it is not just what the parolee did, but also ‘who’ he was.  But independent of this effect, parolees who were being considered when the prison ‘reception centre’ was crowded were less likely to be returned.  Parolees charged with technical violations or who had absconded from supervision in punitive counties were out of luck: they were more likely to be returned than if they lived in more ‘liberal’ communities.  In addition, serious or violent offenders who lived in punitive counties had an increased likelihood of being returned to prison if charged with (but not convicted of) a criminal offence.  Blacks and Hispanics charged with (but not convicted of) criminal offences were more likely than Whites to find themselves being ordered back to prison by the parole board., Conclusion:  Parole boards obviously exercise a good bit of discretion when deciding how to respond to charges involving new offences and to violations of the conditions of parole.  The most important factors for those violating any condition of release appear to be whether a parolee is a registered sex offender or a serious or violent offender.  This is especially true if there is an allegation of a new criminal offence.   Since these offenders were, at the time, referred automatically to the parole board, it is not surprising that they were, virtually automatically, also sent back to prison.   But overall, the fact that parolees were generally more likely to be returned to prison in punitive counties demonstrates that the parole board is concerned about its own local reputation., Reference: Lin, Jeffrey, Ryken Grattet, and Joan Petersilia (2010).  “Back-end Sentencing” and Reimprisonment: Individual, Organizational, and Community Predictors of Parole Sanctioning Decisions.  Criminology, 48(3), 759-760., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV11N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-11-no-5-%E2%80%93-january-2011,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 11, No. 5 – January 2011",Regular Issue,2011
"The most important function that pre-sentence reports serve may not be to provide information to the courts. Instead, they may allow legal professionals to process guilty pleas in a manner that allows everyone to believe that individualized decisions concerning the accused have been made.",", Officially, the pre-sentence report (PSR) is designed to provide sentencing judges with the information necessary to sentence an accused person.  In jurisdictions without strict sentencing guidelines, PSRs, theoretically, help inform the court about the character of the accused so that an ‘individualized’ sentence can be imposed.   This paper suggests that their real function is more complex than simply providing information to the court., The study used a variety of methods to try to understand the use of PSRs – interviews, focus groups, observation of the production of PSRs and their use in court, and ‘moot’ sentencing hearings combined with interviews with the judges and lawyers involved in these hearings.  PSRs are typically written so as to provide the reader with detailed information about the background and personal and social circumstances of accused people.  However, in this study (in Scotland) it was determined that sentencers (and other court professionals) see this information as being of marginal importance.  Judges and defence counsel were also highly critical of PSRs that focused largely on offending.  Defence counsel, however, often used PSRs “as a tool to build rapport with and win the confidence of clients” (p. 264).  PSRs are seen “as a way to demonstrate clearly to clients that they are treated as unique individuals” (p. 247).  Such a view of the process is particularly important given that most cases in (most) lower courts are resolved by way of a guilty plea with relatively little information being brought to the court in the form of formal evidence., Given, therefore, that ‘guilt’ is rarely an issue in the lower courts, but sentencing is, the PSR can serve to have the appearance of giving responsibility for the outcome of the case back to the accused person.  Even though judges indicated that they often skimmed PSRs, they reported that the PSR gave them a holistic and ‘objective’ account of the offender and the offence., The individualizing features of PSRs “assist in the expeditious disposal of cases” in four different ways. First, they assist defence counsel in convincing their clients to plead guilty, given that the offenders can then, via the PSR, communicate their account of their lives and their offences. Second, they provide ‘facts’ to the court.  These ‘facts’ are then used, by all sides, to create a coherent and unique account of the case. Third, PSRs can be seen as providing the court with an insight into the ‘moral character’ (p. 256) of the accused.  Finally, “Reports provide legal professionals with a way of smoothing over the felt discomfort about the ‘gap problem’ between what is claimed for the law and the daily reality.  Thus, reports are not simply a matter of ‘empty ceremony’, but [they are] vital to the ability to dispose of cases in a way that does not appear to be contrary to justice.  The ‘efficient’ production of guilty pleas depends on the ability of legal professionals to explain their actions not only to defendants, and to each other, but most crucially to themselves…. ‘Efficiency’ depends on  legal professionals’ sense that individualization is not a complete fiction, but something demonstrable and real.  In this way, the operation of ‘individualization’ enables the ‘efficient’ disposal of cases” (p. 256)., Conclusion:  Pre-sentence reports (PSRs) can be seen as legitimating the summary process (that leads to a guilty plea) by easing the concerns of professionals that defendants should be treated as individual cases and with dignity.  In other words, in a court that is processing many cases in quite a ‘routine’ manner, the PSR stands out as the symbol that demonstrates to legal professionals “that they are taking part in a process that is legally just” (p. 256)., Reference: Tata, Cyrus (2010).  A Sense of Justice: The Role of Pre-sentence Reports in the Production (and Disruption) of Guilt and Guilty Pleas.  Punishment & Society, 12(3), 239-261., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV11N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-11-no-5-%E2%80%93-january-2011,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 11, No. 5 – January 2011",Regular Issue,2011
People who have little confidence in the criminal justice system and are most critical of sentences being handed down by the courts are likely to have very little knowledge of the operation of the criminal justice system.,", A wide range of studies carried out in a number of countries have found that most people think that sentences in their countries are too lenient. Previous research would suggest that when people say this, they are thinking about unusual cases, often cases involving extreme violence.  At the same time, it is well known that people have very little information about sentencing practices in court (Criminological Highlights 4(1)#5).  When they do get adequate information about sentencing and the sentencing process, it appears that they are often quite likely to differ very little from the courts in the sentences they prefer (Criminological Highlights, 9(4)#2, 6(2)#6, 8(6)#1, 3(3)#4)., This study looks at the relationship, in a sample of ordinary people, between public confidence in the (Australian) criminal justice system and the public’s knowledge about crime and criminal justice.  Confidence in the criminal justice system was assessed on the basis of people’s answers to questions in five areas:  sentence severity, bringing offenders to justice, meeting the needs of victims, treating accused people fairly, and respecting the rights of those accused of crimes., Knowledge was assessed with six questions about local crime and justice: changes in the level of property crime (actual: a decrease); the proportion of reported crime involving violence (actual=7%); the proportion of burglars brought to court who were convicted (actual = 73%); proportion of those brought to court for assault who were convicted (actual = 74%); proportion of those convicted of home burglary who were imprisoned (actual =61%);  and the imprisonment rate for assault (14%).  Responses were categorized according to how far (in either direction) they were from the correct answer., After controlling statistically for education, age, income, and whether the respondent lived in a metropolitan area, high levels of knowledge of these dimensions tended to predict people’s confidence in the criminal justice system.  For example, those who knew that property crime had decreased and that violence constituted only a small portion of all crime reported to the police, and those who were accurate about assault and burglary conviction rates and burglary imprisonment rates were most likely to think that the severity of sentences was ‘about right’ even when controlling for demographic variables. This finding also held when factors such as whether the respondent was university educated were controlled for statistically., Conclusion:  It would appear that part of the lack of confidence that people have about the operation of the criminal justice system comes from a general lack of knowledge about how it operates.  The impact of knowledge is large and appears to exist when other factors were held constant.  For example, of those people in their 40s, who were less than university educated, earned less than the median income, and had low knowledge about crime and justice, only 4% thought that sentences were about right in their level of severity.  About 60% of identically placed respondents with high knowledge thought that sentences were about right. It is not terribly surprising that there is a general lack of knowledge about the criminal justice process and that many people lack confidence in this public institution: much public discourse about crime and criminal justice appears to be ill-informed and, therefore, the public can hardly be held responsible for their lack of knowledge.  But clearly judgments about the operation of the criminal justice system from those who know how it operates are likely to be very different from those who express views but do know how it actually operates., Reference:  Jones, Craig and Don Weatherburn (2010).

Serious crime in schools in the US is declining. Schools can reduce crime even more by changing the manner in which they are managed.,", It is not surprising that schools are seen as places where crime occurs: schools bring youths together at a stage in their lives when they are especially likely to be committing crimes and to be victimized by other youths.  In the US since 1993, there has been a downward trend in school crime that parallels overall youth victimization.  Nevertheless, there has been an increase, in the past 20 years, in surveillance systems and metal detectors in school, even though there are no data suggesting that these ‘target hardening’ techniques have any effect on crime in school., Even though youths spend only about 20% of their waking hours in school, their victimization rates in school are similar to their rates away from school.  This can hardly be seen as surprising since schools, by definition, put potential young offenders and victims in close proximity to one another. The exception is for murder.  In the US, only about 1% of murders of school-age youths take place in schools., The amount of crime in a school cannot be predicted by looking at “the sum of criminal propensities of the enrolled students” (p. 317) nor do simple structural variables (e.g., school size) account for much of the variability in school-crime rates.  Though obviously the characteristics of students and the communities they come from have effects on the amount of crime in a school, the variables that are under the control of schools – how the school is managed, and how discipline is imposed on youths – also have effects (see also Criminological Highlights 4(2)#4, 4(5)#5). Students in schools react to their environment: Youths who (on a random basis) were given the opportunity to move into more ‘high performing’ schools were less likely to be involved in crime than their classmates who, as a result of a lottery,  were not able to move to better, less crime-prone, schools.  The division within a school district between primary and middle school was not, however, important in predicting levels of violence in schools (Criminological Highlights 10(4)#4)., Not surprisingly, schools with low achieving youths tend to have more crime. More interesting are the findings from experimental and quasi-experimental studies showing that interventions that improve academic performance have an important side effect: problem behaviours decrease. School policies also make a difference: “When schools monitor students and control access to the campus, and when students perceive that school rules are fair and consistently enforced, schools experience lower levels of problem behaviour” (p. 369). On the other hand, “severity of sanctions [imposed by schools] is not related to reduction in problem behaviours” (p. 369)., Conclusion: School officials would be well advised to examine carefully recommendations that have been made to deal with crime in school.  Some experiments (e.g., with certain kinds of peer counseling) have been shown to increase crime; many very popular interventions (e.g., bringing more police into the schools) have not been shown to be effective.  At the same time, some more challenging and fundamental interventions related to the way in which schools are managed and the manner in which misbehaviour is responded to have been demonstrated to be effective in reducing the amount of misbehaviour in school., Reference: Cook, Philip J., Denise C.

What happens when illicit drug use is decriminalized?  The evidence from Portugal’s decision in 2000 to decriminalize the use of drugs and possession for personal use suggests that not much changed.,", In various countries, drug laws or drug law enforcement have been liberalized. In The Netherlands, for example (Criminological Highlights 11(2)#5) the selling of small amounts of marijuana and its personal use is tolerated under certain circumstances. In South Australia, cannabis use was decriminalized.  Portugal is especially interesting to examine because in 2001, the government decriminalized the possession of all drugs for personal use.  A key rationale was to provide a more health-oriented response to drug use based on treatment of those who were drug dependent. In theory, those apprehended for drug possession were to be referred to Commissions for the Dissuasion of Drug Addiction for assessment, sanctioning, or access to treatment., Portugal appears to be a ‘transit nation’ for various drugs with a disproportionate amount of drug seizures in Europe taking place. Hence although drugs are available in the country, with the exception of heroin use in the late 1980s and 1990s, drug use appears generally to have been relatively low compared to other European countries.  This paper looks primarily at the small amount of data that are available on the use of drugs during the period after the personal use of drugs was decriminalized.  The focus is on a simple question: what effects did decriminalization have on drug use. Unfortunately, there were no population surveys of drug use prior to the change in law. However, there are some data that can be used to examine the impact of the decriminalization decision., Between 2001 (when the law changed) and 2007 there were very small increases in the prevalence of illicit drug use in Portugal among adults (age 15-64) who were surveyed. However, the 2007 rates in Portugal were lower than those in Italy and Spain and the increase in rates that did take place in Portugal were small and were generally lower than in these other two countries., For high school youths, there were some data collected prior to the law change in 2001.  Again, there were some increases in Portugal between 1999 and 2003 (which then dropped off by 2007). However, these increases in drug use by high school youths in Portugal were comparable to the increases elsewhere in Europe and, after 6 years’ experience with the changed law, rates of drug use in Portugal were still lower than in Italy and elsewhere in the European Union., Drug trafficking offences (which were never decriminalized) did not increase after 2001 in Portugal.  Drug prices decreased during this time, though it is hard to understand exactly why. Drug related deaths dropped steadily between 1999 and 2003.  In Italy and Spain, drug related deaths also dropped but were generally higher than in Portugal., Not surprisingly, the number of people arrested for drug offences dropped dramatically, from about 14,000 criminal drug offences in 2000 to an average of about 5000-5500 after the change in law. However, the number of people detected for drug use under the new law for drug use/possession remained fairly constant during the first decade of this century., Conclusion:  Portugal’s experience with decriminalizing simple drug possession in 2001 suggests that “contrary to some predictions, decriminalization does not inevitably lead to rises in drug use” (p. 1016).   What is notable about Portugal, of course, is that the change in law related to the response to all drugs, not cannabis alone.  Though it is impossible to know for certain what the impact was of the change in drug policy, it is quite clear that “there are no signs of mass expansion of the drug market in Portugal” (p. 1017)., Reference: Hughes, Caitlin Elizabeth and Alex Stevens (2010).  What Can We Learn From the Portuguese Decriminalization of Illicit Drugs?  British Journal of Criminology, 50, 999-1022., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV11N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-11-no-5-%E2%80%93-january-2011,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 11, No. 5 – January 2011",Regular Issue,2011
Intensive enforcement of drug laws appears to be an ineffective way of increasing the price of illicit drugs.,", Each year in the US hundreds of thousands of people are incarcerated for drug offences. The primary focus of ‘drug strategies’ in some countries is on enforcement rather than ‘demand-side’ programs of prevention and treatment.  Between 1980 and 2010, incarceration rates in the US for drug offenders increased almost 10-fold, while prices for cocaine and heroin in the US fell substantially., It appears that simple ‘risk-price’ models do not fit the data related to drug offences. Control over the supply of drugs – and arrests and incarceration for long periods of time of those in the drug business – should push prices up since the ‘cost’ of doing business has increased.  The theory would then suggest that higher prices of drugs (the result of the high expected cost of doing business) should reduce consumption.  The data do not support this simple economic model.  In the US, arrests for cocaine and heroin have been fairly stable since the late 1980s, but the number of people in prison has gone up dramatically.  Prices (in 2007 dollars) for cocaine dropped dramatically in the 1980s during a period of apparent market expansion, were steady in the 1990s, and dropped again, between 2000 and 2007 by about 25%.  But even though the price went down, total consumption did not go up., One problem in ‘modeling’ the effect of enforcement efforts on drug use is that the effects on two different types of users – hard core dependent users who are typically a minority in number but who consume the majority of drugs, and non-dependent users – may be very different. One estimate suggests that a small number of cocaine and heroin users account for 84-93% of total spending on the drugs.  It is possible that enforcement efforts can minimize the number of people who become hard core drug users in the beginning of a drug ‘epidemic’ in a community by restricting access to drugs. On the other hand, committing significant resources to drug enforcement may have little impact after drug use is widely established., The challenge for law enforcement approaches is that the large number of dealers present in a city means that even huge numbers of arrests would be expected to have little impact. It is estimated that in a city of about a million people in the US, there would be approximately 3300 cocaine dealers.  The simultaneous arrest of several hundred would therefore hardly touch the selling process., At the same time, it is clear that drug prohibition (as compared to complete legalization) does increase the price of drugs.  However, “for most established markets, expanding enforcement beyond a [simple] base level is a very expensive way to purchase further increments in price. Overall, the US is far into the region of diminishing returns; toughness could be cut with modest effects on prices and use. Alternatively, toughness could be focused on the forms of dealing that are most violent or otherwise noxious….” (p. 259)., Conclusion: It would appear that a certain level of drug enforcement can keep a market from developing in locations where there is, essentially, no existing market.  And if a market is expanding toward a high level of use, some enforcement may help delay that expansion.   But in locations with high and stable rates of drug incarceration, reducing the number of prisoners could be carried out without any adverse effects on drug use.  “Dramatic reductions in incarceration are possible without entering uncharted waters of permissiveness, and the expansion of today’s unprecedented levels of incarceration seems to have made little contribution to the reduction in US drug problems” (p. 261)., Reference: Caulkins, Jonathan P. and Peter Reuter (2010).

"Rather than focusing on severity-based policies that increase already harsh sentences, policy makers should shift their attention to programs that use the police to make the risks and consequences of crime more clear and certain. Such a policy shift holds the promise of reducing both crime and imprisonment.","Imprisonment rates in many countries, most notably the United States, are a concern in part because of the various costs of imprisonment and the fact that high imprisonment rates appear to have little effect in reducing crime.  There is a substantial amount of research suggesting that increasing the severity of sentences from current levels will not increase the (general) deterrent impact of the criminal justice system (see Criminological Highlights, 6(2)#1) and is not efficient in reducing crime through incapacitation (Criminological Highlights, 3(1)#1, 10(2)#5)., This paper points out that deterrence always depends on both certainty and severity.  But variation in sentence severity – within levels that are plausible in western societies – does not appear to have much, if any, impact on crime.  Given the various costs of imprisonment (financial as well as social), a very attractive criminal justice approach to crime prevention is one that reduces both crime and imprisonment levels. Incapacitation does not qualify as such a policy since it “necessarily will increase the rate of imprisonment. In contrast, if the policy also prevents crime by deterrence, then it is possible that it will be successful in reducing both imprisonment and crime” (p. 16).  In addition, to the extent that the experience of prison is criminogenic (see Criminological Highlights,11(1)#1, 11(1)#2, 11(4)#2), policies that reduce imprisonment have an additional advantage.  There are, of course, many other ways to reduce crime.  However, given that substantial amounts of public money are spent on the criminal justice system, the question that should be addressed by criminal justice policy makers is a simple one: how can this “criminal justice budget” best be used?, A careful analysis of the data suggests that a fundamental shift should occur – from focusing on sentence severity to focusing on the certainty of apprehension.  A shift of this sort does not mean that by increasing police budgets, crime rates will automatically be lowered.  Instead this analysis suggests that targeted increases in police activity that increase the likelihood that offenders will be apprehended can prevent crime in the first place and thereby avert the need for punishing an apprehended offender.  In other words, averting crime also averts punishment.  For example, regular drug testing of probationers to enforce prohibitions against drug use resulted in more certain but shorter imprisonment periods (1-2 days); this, in turn, was quite effective in deterring probationers from drug use and other probation violations. In this way, the certainty of apprehension averted the need for exacting further punishment. What is crucial, of course, is that potential offenders must believe that their likelihood of apprehension and punishment is high., The difficulty is that achieving certainty in delivering punishments is elusive.  Not all police programs – or programs that simply increase the number of police in a neighbourhood – achieve high levels of real or perceived certainty of punishment.  However, “the key empirical conclusions… are that at prevailing levels of certainty and severity, relatively little reliable evidence of variation in the severity of punishment having a substantial deterrent effect is available and that relatively strong evidence indicates that variation in the certainty of punishment has a large deterrent effect, particularly from the vantage point of specific programs that alter the use of police” (p. 37)., Conclusion:  If policy makers are committed to using criminal justice budgets effectively, shifting funds from imprisonment to policing could be effective in reducing both crime and imprisonment.  Since people are likely to be deterred by programs that increase the (perceived) likelihood of apprehension, those program will prevent crime and those people who are deterred will not end up in prison. There are, obviously, potential costs to such programs as well.  Hence programs that appear to be effective in one location need to be continually evaluated as they are implemented in new locations.  And these evaluations need to examine not just the impact on crime, but also other impacts on communities and residents., Reference: Durlauf, Steven N. and Daniel S. Nagin (2011).  Imprisonment and Crime: Can Both Be Reduced?  Criminology and Public Policy, 11(1), 9-54., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV11N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-11-no-6-%E2%80%93-april-2011,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 11, No. 6 – April 2011",Regular Issue,2011
Those citizens – jury members – who have intimate knowledge of specific criminal cases are quite content with sentences imposed by judges in those cases.,", Public opinion polls in most western countries suggest that the vast majority of people – typically about 70-80% – say that sentences, in general, are too lenient.  Extensive research carried out in many countries suggests that the answers to such questions reflect a belief based on inadequate knowledge of cases and the sentences actually handed down. Instead, the answers that people give to questions about ‘sentence severity’ appear to be based on people’s beliefs about sentences or the sentencing process rather than being carefully considered conclusions based on evidence of what goes on in court., This study – carried out at the suggestion of the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia –examines how sentences, as handed down by the courts, are perceived by a group of ordinary citizens who have extensive knowledge of a single case: jurors in the Australian state of Tasmania who decided on the guilt of the accused in criminal trials.  Before the judge handed down the sentences in 138 trials in which there was a guilty verdict, jurors were asked to indicate the sentence they thought should be imposed.  Overall 52% chose a sentence that was more lenient than the sentence actually imposed by the judge, 44% chose a more severe sentence, and 4% gave exactly the same sentence as the judge. There was some variation across offence types but in all cases about half or more of the jurors recommended the same or a more lenient sentence than did the judge.  Ninety percent thought that the actual sentence handed down by the judge was very or fairly appropriate., Those whose preferred sentence was more lenient than the sentence actually handed down by the judge were significantly more likely to say that the judge’s actual sentence was very appropriate than were those who had selected a more severe sentence than the judge. “In other words, jurors who were more punitive were less tolerant of the judge’s sentence and less malleable in their views than the more lenient jurors” (p. 5)., The responses of the jurors in this study to questions about sentencing generally were typical of those who answer such questions on public opinion polls.  These jurors were asked their opinion about sentences in general.  The majority thought that, in general,  sentences were too lenient for all offence types, most notably for sex and violence where 80% and 76%, respectively, thought sentences were too lenient.   Though jurors were slightly less likely to say that sentences generally were “much too lenient” after they heard the judge’s sentence in “their” case, the majority of jurors still believed that, in general,  judges’ sentences are too lenient.  Hence it would seem that this one exposure to a ‘complete’ case did not have a dramatic impact on jurors’ overall views of sentencing. Apparently, in general, the 698 jurors who participated in the study saw their case as being exceptional in the sense that the judge handed down an appropriate sentence., As in other studies, those jurors who thought that sentences, generally, were too lenient were more likely to think that crime in their state had increased (when, in fact, it had decreased in recent years).  Thinking that sentences were too lenient was also correlated with overestimating the proportion of crime that involves violence and underestimating the likelihood of imprisonment for those convicted of rape., Conclusion: The basic findings – that jurors are not more punitive than judges in recommending sentences for actual cases when jurors and judges have the same information – are consistent with other findings on public attitudes to sentencing. These findings underline the importance of responding sensibly to public opinion on sentencing. Most citizens have little if any information about the details of criminal cases. Hence their view that sentences are too lenient is best thought of as a ‘belief’ rather than an attitude based on a careful assessment of information., Reference: Warner, Kate, Julia Davis, Maggie Walter, Rebecca Bradfield, and Rachel Vermey (2011).  Public Judgement on Sentencing: Final Results from the Tasmanian Jury Sentencing Study.

Providing social services in neighbourhoods in which many former prisoners live is associated with lower rates of recidivism.,", When prisoners are released, they typically return to the communities from which they came. It has frequently been pointed out that programs to help inmates reintegrate into their communities can be important in reducing crime (see Criminological Highlights, 3(2)#5, 6(1)#1).  Factors that make it difficult for former inmates to re-establish contact with offending peer groups can reduce future offending (Criminological Highlights, 10(5)#1).  What seems reasonably clear from the existing research is that re-offending is affected, in part, by the circumstances of the offenders in the communities they return to.  This paper examines the impact on subsequent offending of the availability of services to former inmates in the immediate neighbourhood to which an offender returns., Social service agencies in the immediate neighbourhood of a returning offender can provide help in addressing the factors that affect re-offending.  It would appear, however, from public health findings that, especially for the poor, it is important that these services be located relatively near their target populations.  Services that are distant aren’t likely to be accessed, in part because of the costs of getting to the service.  Welfare recipients, for example, have been shown to be much more likely to access services if these services are close to where they live., This study looks at California parolees who were released in 2005 or 2006.  Parolees are required to live at a specific address and each parolee’s presence at that address is likely to be verified by a parole officer. The locations of social service agencies that provide services to parolees are known because parole officers guide parolees to those services.   Hence the availability of services to parolees can be measured.  In this study, the measure of ‘proximate social service agencies’ was the number of different programs available to parolees within two miles of the parolee’s home., Various other factors were controlled statistically including residential stability, racial composition and level of disadvantage of the neighbourhood;  the age, race, and sex of the offender;  years the parolee spent in prison, and the number of violent and property offences committed by the parolee. The outcome measure was whether or not the parolee was returned to prison for any reason (a new offence or a technical violation of the conditions of release)., Those parolees returning to disadvantaged neighbourhoods and to neighbourhoods surrounded by other disadvantaged neighbourhoods were more likely to recidivate than were offenders living elsewhere.  But controlling for neighbourhood and individual characteristics, those parolees returning to neighbourhoods with many services available to them were less likely to be returned to prison.  On the other hand, if there was a large demand for services (measured by the number of parolees in the neighbourhood), there was increased recidivism, presumably because of the difficulty parolees had in accessing these services., Conclusion:  With thousands of people being released from prison every year, it is inevitable that some will re-offend and be returned to prison.  However, it appears that public policy – in this case providing services in the neighbourhoods in which parolees live – can reduce future re-offending., Reference: Hipp, John R., Joan Petersilia, and Susan Turner (2010).  Parolee Recidivism in California: the Effect of Neighbourhood Context and Social Service Agency Characteristics.  Criminology, 48(4), 947-979., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV11N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-11-no-6-%E2%80%93-april-2011,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 11, No. 6 – April 2011",Regular Issue,2011
Being sent to prison does not decrease subsequent offending.,", Recent research (see Criminological Highlights 11(1)#1, 11(1)#2, 11(4)#2) suggests that sending offenders to prison is likely, if anything, to increase slightly the likelihood that they will re-offend compared to what would have occurred had they been given some other sentence.  Given that prison sentences are expensive (in Canada, about $322 per prisoner per day for federal prisoners and about $161 for provincial prisoners), if sentences – particularly short sentences – cannot be shown to reduce subsequent offending, it would appear to make sense to search for less expensive alternatives., This study, carried out in New South Wales, Australia, examined the criminal careers of two sets of offenders: those convicted of burglary and those convicted of non-aggravated assault.  For each offence type, pairs of convicted offenders were located one of whom had been imprisoned for the offence, the other who had received a non-custodial sentence.  The members of each pair were matched on variables that have been shown to relate to recidivism such as prior record, prior imprisonments, and whether bail had been refused (as an indicator of concern about reoffending)., The results show that those who were imprisoned for assault were more likely to reoffend even after various factors not used for matching purposes were controlled for statistically.  For those convicted of burglary, the results were similar, but the difference in the likelihood of reoffending for those imprisoned and not imprisoned was not significant., A second study, also carried out in New South Wales, using a relatively similar approach, compared those given prison sentences to those given suspended sentences – non-custodial sentences similar to Canada’s conditional sentence of imprisonment.  In this study, scores measuring an offender’s ‘propensity to reoffend’ were calculated using 16 demographic (e.g., age, economic disadvantage of home neighbourhood) and criminal justice measures (e.g., criminal record, offence seriousness).  Pairs with the same ‘propensity scores’ were created with one of each pair going to prison and the other receiving a suspended sentence. The dependent measure was the length of time the offender remained free of offending in the community., A total of 2,650 pairs of convicted offenders with no prior prison sentences – one of whom was sentenced to prison, the other who received a suspended sentence –  were followed for about 1100 days.  There was no difference between the two groups in the likelihood of being reconvicted.  When examining the 1661 pairs of offenders with prior prison experience, those sent to prison were likely to reoffend earlier than were those who received a suspended sentence., Conclusion:  The results of the two papers are fairly consistent. “It would be unwise to imprison offenders when the only reason for doing so is a belief in the specific deterrent effect of prison” (Study 1: page 10).  The results “provide no evidence to support the contention that offenders given imprisonment are less likely to re-offend than those given a suspended sentence” (Study 2, page 10).   Clearly the findings that certain groups are more likely to reoffend when sent to prison are not completely consistent across studies.  However, what is consistent across studies and with other research is the finding that sending offenders to prison does not reduce subsequent reoffending., Reference:  Weatherburn, Don (2010).  The Effect of Prison on Adult Re-Offending.  Crime and Justice Bulletin (New South Wales, Bureau of Crime, Statistics, and Research) Number 143.  Lulham, Rohan, Don Weatherburn, and Lorana Bartels (2009).  The Recidivism of Offenders Given Suspended Sentences: A Comparison with Full-Time Imprisonment.  Crime and Justice Bulletin, Number 136., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV11N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-11-no-6-%E2%80%93-april-2011,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 11, No. 6 – April 2011",Regular Issue,2011
Those employers who use criminal records checks for job applicants should know that for most former offenders who have lived crime-free in the community for about 10 years the criminal record no longer predicts offending.,", There is substantial evidence that job applicants who have a criminal record are severely disadvantaged when they look for jobs (see Criminal Highlights 6(3)#2). Given that a substantial portion of people in many countries have criminal records, it is important to know how predictive these records are of future offending.  Recent research (Criminological Highligths 10(5)#6, 8(4)#4) suggests that, in general, after a few years of living in the community without additional offending, those with criminal records are no more likely to offend than those without records., This paper looks at a large and varied group of offenders: a representative sample of 3,243 male Dutch offenders whose cases were adjudicated in 1977.  Their pre-1977 criminal records were made available to the researchers as were records of their offending thereafter.  In addition, a representative sample of same age male ‘non-offenders’ – those with no record of offending before 1978 -- was examined.  The question, then, is a simple one: how many years of non-offending does it take until offenders have the same probability of offending (defined as a conviction for a criminal offence) as those who have not previously offended?, Looking at all of the 1977 offenders, it is clear that if offenders reoffend, it is likely to occur very soon after their conviction (or release from prison).  But all offenders do not have the same likelihood of reoffending: older people and those without extensive criminal histories are, generally speaking, less likely to reoffend.  From the perspective of an employer, the question is a straightforward one: when does an offender’s likelihood of reoffending become indistinguishable from those who had never offended in 1977.  This might be called the point at which their offending likelihoods converge. It turns out that this is a function of two quite separate factors.  Younger offenders were more likely to reoffend and those with no criminal record prior to 1977 were less likely to reoffend., The youngest groups of offenders with no convictions before their 1977 conviction become indistinguishable from non-offenders after about 10-13 years (depending on the criterion used for being ‘indistinguishable’).  For older offenders, however, the point at which they become indistinguishable from non-offenders occurs earlier – 6 to 10 years for 27 year olds, and 2 years for men 42-46 years old who offended in 1977., For those with extensive criminal records in 1977, however, the time it takes for a person who is crime-free in the community to become indistinguishable from non-offenders is considerably longer and, depending on the criterion for being ‘indistinguishable’, they may always have a slightly higher likelihood of reoffending than those who had not offended prior to 1977., Conclusion: These data suggest that knowledge that a person once committed a criminal offence gives very little information about the likelihood that he will reoffend.  However, knowing the age of the person at his last offence and his prior criminal record increases the accuracy of prediction.  For those who had no criminal record before being convicted in 1977, ten years of crime-free living brings the probability of reoffending down to the level of non-offenders as it does for those 27 or older who, prior to offending in 1977, had no more than 3 previous convictions. It should also be remembered that, in general, reoffending, if it is to take place, is much more likely to occur shortly after the most recent conviction., Reference: Bushway, Shawn D., Paul Nieubeerta, and Arjan Blokland (2011).  The Predictive Value of Criminal Background Checks: Do Age and Criminal History Affect Time to Redemption?  Criminology, 49(1), 27-60., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV11N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-11-no-6-%E2%80%93-april-2011,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 11, No. 6 – April 2011",Regular Issue,2011
Two common policies for dealing with sex offenders do not reduce the incidence of sex crime recidivism: (1) the requirement that sex offenders register their whereabouts with the police and (2) the requirement that police notify people who live in the same neighbourhood as convicted sex offenders of the sex offender’s whereabouts.,", Simple solutions to serious problems are often politically attractive.  Sex offenders, in particular, appear to be a magnet for ineffective approaches at reducing crime. Previous research has suggested most of these special ‘sex offender’ policies don’t work.  Residence restrictions are ineffective (see Criminological Highlights, 11(4)#7). Registration and public notification of the whereabouts of sex offenders have negative effects (see Criminological Highlights 7(4)#4, 8(6)#5, 9(2)#7) or are ineffective (see Criminological Highlights 4(1)#2, 5(6)#1, 10(3)#7). Policies such as these are based on the false assumption that a sex offender has an atypically high likelihood of reoffending (See Criminological Highlights 3(3)#3, 5(1)#4, 6(3)#3, 6(6)#8) 8(3)#8, 9(2)#5).  This paper examines the impact of South Carolina’s sex offender registration and notification policy on recidivism., The study examines recidivism rates of 6,064 males 16 years old or older who were convicted of sex offences for the first time between 1990 and 2004.  About half were registered at some point during the follow-up period.  Some had prior convictions, but not for sex offences. South Carolina’s registration and notification law came into effect in 1995, applied retroactively, and lasts for life.  “Survival” (no recidivism) was measured from the conviction (or end of incarceration period).  The study controlled for age, race, prior (non-sex offence) record, and whether the original crime involved an underage victim.   The analysis examined the relative risk of recidivism., Recidivism was defined, in separate analyses, as either a new charge or a conviction for sex crimes, other person offences, or non-person offences.  Across the whole sample, there was an 8% sex crime charge recidivism rate, a rate that is comparable to a U.S. national study which showed a 3-year recidivism rate of 5.3%. The most important finding is simple: for all six measures (charge/conviction by 3 types of offences) there was no impact on recidivism of being registered when other factors were controlled., Conclusion: Once again, it has been shown that special restrictions and attempts to track sex offenders in the community are ineffective.  This is not surprising in part because recidivism rates for sex offenders are typically very low.  But in addition, most sex offenders are known to their victims before the offence; hence registration and notification logically add nothing to the ability to identify who is a risk to the community.  Sex offender registration and notification systems use “substantial resources for rigorous monitoring of all sex offenders rather than targeted and intensive supervision of those most likely to reoffend” (p. 455).  Finally, focusing on ineffective solutions to serious problems distracts policy makers from searching for more effective and more cost effective ways to reduce victimization., Reference: Letourneau, Elizabeth J, Jill S.

Victim impact statements can increase the likelihood that jurors in death penalty cases will impose the death penalty.  Victim impact evidence encourages jurors to decide on whether to impose the death penalty on the basis of their feelings for the victim and the victim’s family.,", Victim impact evidence at sentencing is seen in many jurisdictions as a ‘natural’ way of ‘giving a voice’ to the victim in criminal procedures.  However, if the evidence has any impact, it logically follows that sentencers (judges, or juries in some U.S. capital cases) will be harsher with offenders whose victims (or families of victims) are seen in a more favourable light., A 1987 U.S. Supreme Court case forbid the use of victim impact evidence (VIE) in capital cases on the assumption that, among other things, it would divert attention from the culpability of the accused to the character and reputation of the victim. Four years later, with new justices on the court, the same court reversed itself deciding that VIE was relevant because it provided evidence of the harm that the offender had done.  The concern of the dissenters in this decision was that VIE would arouse strong emotions, anger and sympathy, in part because it would focus attention on an ‘identifiable’ victim. The concern was that an identifiable (single) victim would trigger emotional responses about the collateral harm done to the victim’s family and friends.  Said differently, the judges who dissented expressed concern that this evidence would “encourage jurors to decide in favor of death rather than life on the basis of their emotions rather than their reason” (p. 133)., This study presents the results of an experiment – using materials from an actual capital case – in which people who were qualified to sit on a jury watched a 3.5 hour video of the penalty phase of the trial in a capital case.  For roughly half of the ‘jurors’ the video included the VIE while for the others, the VIE was edited out.  The victim (a police officer) was, of course, described in very favourable terms by his sister. In addition, the evidence provided by the victim’s sister described the impact on the victim’s daughter in vivid language that was almost certain to elicit an emotional response. The sister’s VIE did not include a specific recommendation, but the implication was clear: she asked the jury to impose “a just punishment for an unjustifiable death” (p. 144)., 63% of those who saw the VIE preferred a death sentence, compared to only 18% of those who did not see this evidence.  Those who saw the VIE were more likely to report feeling upset and hostile. In addition the VIE elicited more feelings of sympathy and empathy for the victim and victim’s family.  Even though the VIE did not include any evidence about the offender, the offender was described in more negative terms by those who were exposed to the VIE.  Not surprisingly, the VIE created more positive impressions of the victim and his family.  A multivariate analysis demonstrated that the decision to impose the death penalty was mediated in part by feelings of anger and vengefulness toward the offender, sympathy and empathy toward the victim, and favourable views of the victim and the victim’s family., Conclusion: In ordinary criminal cases as well as capital cases in the U.S., victim impact evidence has been deemed to be relevant to sentencing outcomes.  This study demonstrates clearly that this evidence has an effect on the outcome of jury decisions (in capital cases) and probably other cases in which juries make recommendations (e.g., second degree murder cases in Canada). More generally, however, this evidence is likely to affect the manner in which sentences are handed down by shifting the focus from the crime and the offender to the character and impact of the crime on the victim.  Though the effect of victim impact evidence on judges (or parole board members) has not been examined by this study, it would be hard to argue that judges or parole board members are not affected by the same human processes that are responsible for these effects., Reference:  Paternoster, Ray and Jerome Deise (2011).  A Heavy Thumb on the Scale: The Effect of Victim Impact Evidence on Capital Decision Making.

The differences in violent offending rates between adolescent girls and boys decreases as neighbourhood disadvantage increases.   Violent peers in disadvantaged neighbourhoods have a larger impact on offending by girls than they do on boys’ offending.,", It is well established that males commit violent offences at a higher rate than females. However, the “structural correlates of female offending closely resemble those of male offending” (p. 959).  For example, cities with high rates of economic disadvantage tend to have higher rates of serious crimes for both males and females, but “females account for a greater share of arrests in economically distressed cities” (p. 960) than they do in less economically distressed locations., Exposure to violent peers –  which is more likely to occur in disadvantaged neighbourhoods –  is one of the strongest correlates of violent behaviour. This paper investigates the possibility that the difference in the relative rates of male and female offending may be a result, in part, of differences in exposure to violent peers.  The differences between males’ and females’ exposure to violent peers may be less in disadvantaged neighbourhoods in which girls cannot be monitored., A total of 1502 girls and boys (as well as their primary caregivers) were interviewed three times when they were, on average, roughly 13, 15, and 18 years old.  These youths lived in 78 different Chicago neighbourhoods that varied dramatically in economic disadvantage (assessed in terms of the percent of neighbourhood residents below the poverty line, receiving public assistance, unemployed, etc.).   Youths were asked about the violent behaviour of their friends and, in addition, filled out self-report measures of their own violent offending.   Various other factors (e.g., victimization history, family structure) were controlled for statistically., Overall, males and those living in disadvantaged neighbourhoods were more likely to engage in violent behaviour.  However, the difference between male and female violent offending rates decrease as concentrated disadvantage increased.   The strength of these findings was reduced only slightly when individual characteristics (e.g., whether the respondent had been victimized, or a measure of self-control) and family structure were controlled for., Males and those in disadvantaged neighbourhoods were more likely to have violent friends. There was no indication that girls were especially likely to be exposed to violent peers in disadvantaged neighbourhoods.  However, “the effect of peer violence on self-reported violent offending is significantly stronger for females than for males” (p. 969)., Conclusion: It would appear that “the nature of peer influence on [violent] behaviours is not universal; rather it varies by gender” (p. 974).  Specifically, males and females are more likely to be exposed to violent peers if they live in disadvantaged neighbourhoods.  But the influence on girls of having violent friends appears to be greater than it is for boys.  These findings suggest that if communities are concerned about negative influences of violent peers on adolescents, it would be wise to focus, especially, on the impact on girls., Reference: Zimmerman, Gregory M. and Steven F.

"Fights that appear to be over “nothing” or fights over “trivial matters” are, in fact, fights over something:  social rank.","The term “senseless violence” is interesting because it would appear to suggest that certain types of violence – typically violence in which there isn’t an obvious object that is the source of conflict – is irrational or inexplicable.  “In effect, the issue of contention [in this type of violence] is so trifling or banal that it seems both noninstrumental and incapable of sparking the level of rage necessary to propel an actor toward the expressive use of violence against an adversary” (p. 62).  This paper explains this “inexplicable” violence., It is suggested that “senseless violence” occurs “in social relationships that are equal, or symmetrical in nature” (p. 63).  “Violence over trivial issues of contention should be much more likely between [opponents of equal status] than between [opponents of different statuses] because trivial disputes symbolically represent an effort to change the status quo and establish dominance in the relationships” (p. 69)., This study examines accounts of 261 violent interactions described by 142 women who were interviewed while they were serving sentences in an Ontario prison.  The women described, in their own words, up to 6 violent incidents that had taken place during the previous three years with people they  knew  but who were not intimate partners.  These detailed accounts were transcribed, and the immediate issue over which violence erupted was identified.  A violent altercation was classified as being the result of a substantive issue when the fight involved property, the protection of an individual, the termination of a valued relationship, or sexual rivalry or jealousy.  Fights were classified as being the result of ‘trivial’ issues if the precipitating event involved insults, verbal slights, gestures, or other matters that could not be seen as ‘substantively’ important., The relationship between the combatants was coded as being symmetrical (e.g., siblings, cousins, friends, fellow drug users, neighbours) or asymmetrical (e.g., parent-child, drug dealer – drug purchaser, prostitute-john, bartender-customer). Various controls were taken into account – presence of others at the altercation, age, age difference between the two, race, past arrests, whether the respondent frequented bars or clubs, number of major life stressors and the length of the account that the respondent gave of the incident., The results were clear: 17% of the violent events involving asymmetrical relationships (people of different statuses) involved ‘trivial’ precipitating factors.  In contrast, 45% of the violent events involving symmetrical relationships involved trivial precipitating events. What is notable, however, is that even though certain other factors (e.g., the presence of bystanders) predicted whether the violent altercation involved trivial issues of contention, these other factors were very clearly independent of the impact of whether it was a symmetrical relationship.  Said differently, adding controls did not change the size or the nature of the relationship between symmetrical relationships and fights over trivial matters., Conclusion: “Violence involving trivial or small matters is considerably more common among opponents embedded in identical social roles…. When women engage in violent altercations over ‘nothing,’ they do so largely against opponents in symmetrical social roles” (p. 88). When violence erupts over trivial issues, both parties to the altercation essentially are locked in a battle for social rank” (p. 62).  In understanding interpersonal violence, therefore, it is important to go beyond individual characteristics of those involved and look at the relationships between those involved in the altercation., Reference: Griffiths, Elizabeth, Carolyn Yule, and Rosemary Gartner (2011).  Fighting Over Trivial Things: Explaining the Issue of Contention in Violent Altercations.  Criminology, 49(1), 61-94., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV12N1.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-12-no-1-%E2%80%93-august-2011,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 12, No. 1 – August 2011",Regular Issue,2011
The likelihood that a parolee will be found to have violated a condition of parole has at least as much to do with the parole enforcement system as it does the person who is being supervised.,", In 1999, it was estimated that 42% of the growth in U.S. prison admissions was attributable to those whose parole was suspended or revoked.  Returning a parolee to prison obviously can occur as a result of a new offence.  But more often than not it is because of the breach of a condition of parole. Hence the decision to return a parolee to prison is one that is at least partially under the control of the parole officer.  In Canada, for example, of the 700 unsuccessful day and full parole cases from federal penitentiaries in 2009/10, 77% were revoked for violations of conditions rather than for new offences. This study examines the role of supervision regimes on whether a parolee is deemed to have violated parole., Traditionally, it is assumed that the violation of conditions of parole – like the committing of an offence – can be adequately understood by looking at characteristics of the offender who is being supervised.  This paper, on the other hand, examines not only characteristics of the parolee, but also the nature of the supervisory regime and the characteristics of the officer who is doing the supervision. During 2003 and 2004 in California, of the 254,468 people on parole supervision, 49% were found to have violated their parole.  Not surprisingly, personal characteristics did make a difference: those on parole for violent or sex offences were less likely to violate parole than property or drug offenders.  Blacks, males, and those released when they were under 30 years old as well as those labelled as mentally ill were more likely to violate parole., But the expression ‘violating parole’ ignores the fact that supervisory factors also determine whether someone ‘violates’ – or perhaps more properly ‘is found to have violated’ – parole.  In California, three distinct types of supervisory regimes could be identified, based on differences in the number of drug tests (none to once per month) and reporting frequency (monthly by mail to a face-to-face meeting every 2 weeks).  The caseload of parole officers also varied considerably, though in general caseloads were much higher than policy suggested they should be.  Holding constant characteristics of the parolee, those subjected to high levels of supervision were more likely to be found to have violated parole.   Caseload had an inconsequential impact on parole violations.   But the introduction of a “New Parole Model” in the middle of the study period that mandated the use of drug treatment, electronic monitoring, and a residential community re-entry program as alternatives to returning the parolee to prison appeared to be responsible for a large increase in violations. In addition, it would appear that characteristics of the parole officers also made a difference: Parolees with Black parole officers or parolees assigned to parole officers with more than 3 years of experience were less likely to have their parole terminated.  When the intensity of parole supervision is taken into account, the effect of the original offence for which they were imprisoned and then paroled is reduced.  “This finding indicates that differences in supervision inflate the risks that offenders with serious, violent, and sexual prior offenses pose (which are already fairly low), and when supervision factors are controlled, the effects of offence history on risk of violation are reduced” (p. 388)., Conclusion: Whether or not a parolee is found to have violated parole has as much to do with the nature of the supervision as it does with who is being supervised.  Intensive supervision – often focused on violent or sexual offenders – can increase the likelihood of the parolee being found to have violated parole.  This in turn appears to make these categories of offenders appear more likely to violate, thus, in a circular way, justifying even more supervision.   There are also local variations in the likelihood of parole suspensions or charges that appear to be independent of offender characteristics.  To the extent that parole violations fuel incarceration rates and interfere with controlled re-entry into the community, it is clearly important to understand and develop policies that relate to the effective handling of parole violations., Reference: Grattet, Ryken, Jeffrey Lin, and Joan Petersilia (2011).

We know a fair amount about the immediate causes of wrongful convictions.  The question that has not been adequately addressed is why most jurisdictions don’t seem to be doing anything about them.,", Much is known about the factors that seem to account for those cases in which the legal system has acknowledged that a convicted person is “factually innocent” (i.e., where someone else committed the crime or a crime did not take place).  The first analysis of these cases was published in 1932 and since then the research has demonstrated that the factors leading to wrongful convictions have not changed very much., The evidence that police can frequently be wrong in their investigations of criminal events is illustrated by the fact that in the U.S., between 1989 and 1996 about 25% of the ‘primary suspects’ identified by law enforcement officials in rape cases and whose DNA was sent to the FBI for testing were subsequently excluded by the results of the DNA test (p. 830).  A flawed police investigation does not, however, lead to a wrongful conviction, but this finding does demonstrate that the raw materials for wrongful convictions are easy to find. Though the ‘true’ rate of wrongful convictions is unknowable (see Criminological Highlights 7(5)#3, 9(4)#5), most thoughtful estimates, based largely on cases involving DNA would suggest that about 2-5% of contested convictions for serious cases may involve factually innocent people., The factors that lead to wrongful convictions are best thought of not as discrete causes, but as errors that might have been, but were not, corrected at some point in the path leading to conviction.  The factor most commonly present (perhaps in as many as three quarters of known wrongful conviction cases) is mistaken eyewitness identification.  Much is known about the circumstances leading to these errors. False confessions induced by psychologically coercive police interrogation methods appear to be the second most frequent contributor (see Criminological Highlights, 7(4)#7, 11(3)#4). Much is also known about how to minimize these problems.  Tunnel vision – the ignoring of facts that do not fit an initial judgment of guilt – can occur at any stage and may be the result, in part, of other factors (e.g., a positive, but incorrect, eyewitness identification).  False evidence from informants has, in recent years, surfaced as a common problem as has flawed forensic evidence (e.g., incorrect fingerprint or hair matches).  Prosecutorial misconduct (e.g., coaching witnesses on what might be ‘helpful’ evidence and the suppression of evidence) along with inadequate or incompetent defense representation round out the top seven factors., Obviously these factors may be more important in some cases than in others. Eyewitness errors are more common in cross-racial identifications.  In addition, in particularly heinous crimes receiving high media coverage, police and prosecutors may feel pressure to complete their investigations quickly and conclusively, thus making them more susceptible to tunnel vision., Conclusion.  From studies of wrongful convictions, it is clear that a fair amount is known about what factors in a case (e.g., incorrect eyewitness identification, incorrect conclusions from a forensic test) go wrong and lead to wrongful convictions.  In some cases – e.g., eyewitness identification procedures – it is known how those procedures can be dramatically improved.   The most important barrier may not be knowledge, but the reluctance of key people to change.  “It is… the professionals who staff our criminal justice system and the politicians and policymakers who employ them that may require the more significant improvement” (p. 866)., Reference: Gould, Jon B. and Richard A.

The use of custodial sentences for offenders is often justified by the assertion that ‘the public demands it.’   But public support for custodial sentences in many cases may be about as thin as the evidence that custodial sentences deter offenders.,", Those responsible for sentencing policy – either as part of sentencing councils as in England & Wales or judges elsewhere – often talk about the need to promote public confidence in the justice system.  This assumption is supported by simple surveys that suggest that in many countries (including Canada) the majority of the public responds to simple poll questions by saying that most sentences are too lenient. This study goes beyond these simple surveys to help understand better the circumstances when the public is content to use a sanction other than imprisonment., A representative sample of 1023 adults in England & Wales read descriptions of one of three different cases: a serious assault, a serious household burglary, or a fraud involving a substantial loss of money.  Only about a third of respondents indicated that all such offenders should be imprisoned.  Most of the rest of the respondents thought that the decision maker should have discretion as to whether the offender was imprisoned.  Respondents were given a list of 13 potentially mitigating factors and were asked, for each factor, whether it justified a more lenient sentence in all, most, some, or no cases.   The majority of respondents thought that most factors (e.g., the offender has no criminal record, or the offender was a victim of abuse in childhood) would justify a more lenient sentence in at least some cases.  Being a young person (defined as being 18 years old) was the only factor for which a majority thought that it should never result in a more lenient sentence.  Clearly respondents wanted personal factors to have some weight in determining the sentence., In another part of the survey, respondents were told that a judge had decided to impose a prison sentence on an offender (for either an assault or a fraud).  They were then given a list of factors (e.g., the offender had no record, the victim did not want the offender to be imprisoned, the offender is caring for young children) and they were asked if the factor justified a community service order instead of prison.  The majority of respondents thought that each of 6 mitigating factors would probably or definitely justify the imposition of a community service order instead of imprisonment for the assault. For the fraud, the fact that the offender was young was seen as probably justifying community service instead of prison by only 48% of respondents., In another part of the survey, respondents had a relatively serious case described to them that would typically have resulted in a prison sentence.  Not surprisingly about 4/5 of the respondents chose prison as the preferred alternative (over community service or a fine).   However, about half of those who preferred prison found a detailed non-custodial order involving compensating the victim and doing a substantial number of community service hours to be acceptable instead of imprisonment., The public is pragmatic about criminal penalties:  Most respondents thought that the costs of administering sentences should be taken into account when imposing sentences. However, there was more support for considering costs in the case of a social security fraud than there was in the case of an assault., Conclusion: The public clearly wants many or most mitigating factors to be considered in most cases. “While the public may ‘talk tough’ in response to opinion polls which ask whether sentencing is harsh enough, when considering specific criminal cases and individual circumstances, there is considerable support for mitigating punishments” (p. 194).  When details of non-custodial sanctions are made salient to members of the public, they will tolerate them.  Members of the British public appear pragmatic: they generally want costs to be considered when sentences are being imposed.  It would appear that “members of the public react thoughtfully to questions relating to sentencing – and not simply with reflexive punitiveness” (p. 195).  Those policy makers whose approach to sentencing does not go beyond ‘reflexive punitiveness’ may, therefore, not be representing public sentiment., Reference: Roberts, Julian V. and Mike Hough (2011).

California’s 34% reduction in its imprisonment rate between 1967 and 1971 during Ronald Reagan’s first term as governor occurred as a result of the implementation of a number of different policies designed by progressive policy makers with support from a fiscally conservative governor.,", In his second inaugural address as governor of California in January 1971, Ronald Reagan proudly reported that during his first 4-year term violent crime in California cities had been reduced and “Our rehabilitation policies and improved parole system are attracting nationwide attention.  Fewer parolees are being returned to prison at any time in our history and our prison population is lower than at any time since 1963” (p. 311).   This paper examines how California’s imprisonment rate was reduced from 146 prisoners per 100,000 residents in 1968 to 96 in 1972., It is generally agreed that imprisonment rates reflect policy decisions of governments and have little if any relationship to crime rates.  Hence, the reductions in imprisonment rates that have taken place elsewhere (e.g., Finland, The Netherlands, Italy, Poland, France) need to be understood in the specific political and historical contexts in which they occurred., Reagan took office with a pledge to “put our fiscal house in order… and cut… the cost of government” (p. 312).   But even though there were a number of high profile murders during his first term, Reagan supported his officials’ recommendations on corrections policy and was aware of the fact that there were liberal changes that could be made under a conservative governor that would not be supported if they had come from a liberal.  As one of his policy advisors noted “Reagan did not have to look like he’s tough” (p. 312)., California during this period was well known for its progressive criminal justice policies.  Prior to Reagan’s election win in 1966, the state had set up a system that encouraged counties to place offenders on probation rather than sending them into the state prison system. Reductions in prison sentences from each county were rewarded with money transfers to the county to pay for county probation services.  Not surprisingly, probation rates increased, and admissions to state prisons decreased.  In addition, however, the rate of paroling inmates also increased.  The effect was that fewer people were spending long periods of time in sentenced custody.  By increasing the parole release rate, fewer inmates served their full sentences in prison.  And once out on parole, fewer parolees had their parole suspended., There was, then, no single factor responsible for California’s dramatic decrease in imprisonment.  Instead decarceration was accomplished through a number of separate policy changes. Although crime and arrests were increasing during this period, admissions to state prisons declined. And, offenders were serving less of their prison sentences in prison., Conclusion: California’s reduction of imprisonment did not happen by chance. The conservative Governor Reagan supported and applauded the decline in imprisonment in part because it reduced costs.  But in addition, Reagan, the conservative, appeared to have supported the policies developed by his (correctionally liberal) experts.  In the end, the reduction was seen as “a result of the work of professionals and real community support and good attitude in the community” (p. 301).  The experts at the time realized that prior to Reagan’s ascent to power, at least a quarter of prison admissions at the time could be kept in the community instead. By focusing on good government, rather than the politics of hysteria, Reagan and his professional corrections service accomplished a goal that was applauded as being both fiscally and socially good policy., Reference:  Gartner, Rosemary, Anthony N.

"Cases in which juries acquit but judges indicate that they would have convicted are likely to be described by either the judge or the jury as ‘close’ cases.  But in addition, they are likely to be cases in which the defendant does not have a criminal record.",", In the book The American Jury, authors Harry Kalven and Hans Zeisel presented data suggesting that cases in which the evidence was close, jurors were liberated from the facts and tended to decide cases according to their sentiments toward the defendant and their assessment of whether the law was being applied fairly in the case they were hearing. In the Kalven & Zeisel study, 88% of the disagreements between a judge and a jury involved the judge convicting and the jury acquitting., This paper re-examines judge-jury disagreements in a study of 289 cases in four U.S. locations. Judges, jurors, and defense and prosecution lawyers answered questions about each of the cases.  In this study, 73% of the judge-jury disagreements on verdicts involved jury acquittals of cases in which judges indicated that they would have convicted.   These disagreements – jury acquits/judge would convict – occurred largely in cases in which either the judge or the jury (or both) thought that the case was ‘close,’ and in cases in which the accused person had no criminal history., Jury sympathy toward the defendant does not appear to have the consistent impact on judge-jury disagreements that would be expected from the Kalven & Zeisel study.  When judges view the evidence in the case as ‘close’, jury sentiment about the law – that applying the law strictly in this case would not be fair - predicted different outcomes between judges and juries.  There was no such effect in cases in which the jury saw the case as close. This result “provides little support for a theory that suggests evidentiary uncertainty triggers the jury’s retreat to sentiment. Ultimately, the strongest and most consistent predictor of jury acquittal in opposition to a judge’s vote for conviction is a defendant without a criminal record. [In these data], the evidentiary factor of a criminal history has a much stronger influence than jury sentiment in predicting judge-jury disagreements” (p. 1583)., Conclusion:  These data suggest that “in the face of evidentiary uncertainty, juries do not appear to retreat to sentiment; rather, a more complex process of weighting the value of evidence, including the criminal record of the defendant appears to explain [judge-jury] disagreements” (p. 1584).  Clearly the justification for jury trials is that, in some cases, juries will arrive at different verdicts from judges.  In this study, the judge and the jury agreed on 77% of the verdicts. Cases in which they disagreed on verdicts tended to be ones in which the judge or the jury thought the cases were close. But even in the ‘close’ cases, the judge and jury tended to agree on the outcome.  The fact that juries tended to acquit more often – especially when the accused had no criminal record – may simply reflect different assessments by judges and juries of how certain one needs to be to convict someone with a clean record., Reference: Frarrell, Amy and Daniel Givelber (2010).  Liberation Reconsidered: Understanding Why Judges and Juries Disagree About Guilt.  Journal of Criminal Law & Criminology, 100 (4), 1549-1586., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV12N1.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-12-no-1-%E2%80%93-august-2011,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 12, No. 1 – August 2011",Regular Issue,2011
A meta-analysis of 27 independent findings demonstrates that minority suspects who come in contact with the police are more likely to be arrested than white suspects.,", Researchers interested in the effect of race on the decision by police to arrest a suspect typically attempt to control for legal factors such as the strength of the evidence against the accused, the seriousness of the offence, the criminal record and any mandatory policies that might exist in the jurisdiction. Defining arrest as “taking a person into custody for the purpose of charging him/her with a criminal offence”, this study examines all available high quality studies carried out in the U.S. between 1966 and 2004., A thorough search of published and unpublished sources located studies involving 27 independent data sets.  Obviously these studies varied on a number of dimensions including whether the data were recorded by an observer, the police officer, or victims, whether the study focused on juveniles or people of all ages, and whether the study controlled for such factors as the amount of evidence, type of offence, the demeanour of the offender, the seriousness of the offence, the suspect’s prior record, and whether the victim made a request to the officer on whether to arrest the accused.  The meta-analysis allows one to determine whether the inclusion of these variables affects the relationship between race and arrest rate., Because some studies reported more than one estimate of the impact of race on arrest decisions, four different estimates were used: the average effect size, the largest, the smallest, and what was judged to be the methodologically best estimate of the effect.  Nevertheless, the results are remarkably similar: between 19 and 24 of the 27 studies (depending on which effect size is included) show effects supporting the conclusion that minorities are more likely to be arrested than whites.  Pooling across the 27 studies there was a significant effect of race.  On average the arrest rate for whites was about 20%; for minorities it was about 26%.  Studies varied, of course, on how adequately they controlled for legally relevant factors.  However, the adequacy of the controls for legally relevant factors was not related to the race effect: even in the best studies, Blacks were more likely to be arrested than Whites.   Similarly, those studies that attempted to control for the demeanour of the suspect showed effects as large as those that did not., Conclusion. “The results are not mixed.  Race matters [in police decisions on whether to arrest].  [The] finding is consistent with what most of the American public perceives, and that finding holds over time, research site, across data collection methods, and across publication types.  Furthermore, controlling for demeanour, offense severity, presence of witnesses, quality of evidence at the scene, the occurrence or discovery of a new criminal offence during the encounter, the suspect being under the influence of drugs or alcohol, prior record of the suspects, or requests to arrest by victims does not significantly reduce the strength of the relationship between suspect race and arrest” (p. 498).  Even though the overall average size of the effect might seem to be relatively small, “because of the interconnectedness of decisions made in the criminal justice system, even small racial differences that occur at many points in the criminal justice process will compound and produce profound effects further along in the system” (p. 498)., Reference: Kochel, Tammy Rinehart, David B.

A study of serious delinquents demonstrates that most serious delinquents – even high rate offenders -  did not persist in their delinquent careers after being found delinquent. Furthermore long stays in prison did not reduce reoffending and for some youths appeared to increase the likelihood of future offending.,", Some political rhetoric would lead one to the conclusion that youth crime can effectively be addressed by identifying serious adolescent offenders, and then treating or incapacitating them.  The difficulty, as many studies have shown, is that even defining who is a persistent or serious offender is problematic, and those who are labelled as serious or persistent do not necessarily persist (e.g.,  see Criminological Highlights 1(3)#7) 11(3)#1). These papers examine the offending patterns, over a 3-year period, of 1,354 serious young offenders, age 14-18, from two U.S. cities., All of the youths in this study had been found guilty of a serious crime (mostly serious crimes against the person) and for most of the youths, this was not their first appearance in court.  They (and a parent) were interviewed shortly after they were adjudicated as delinquent and roughly every 6 months thereafter and their self-reports of offending were recorded., The youths were divided into 5 distinct groups on the basis of their 3-year offending patterns.  24% of these serious offenders were low rate to start with and almost never offended again.  34% of the youths had offended at a relatively low rate in the beginning of the period, but their offending rates declined over time. About 18% started with a moderate rate and continued offending at this rate throughout the 3-year follow-up.  15% started off with high rates of offending but declined to a very low rate over the 3 years.  Finally, 9% started off with high rates of offending and remained relatively high., For four of these five groups – all except those with initially low rates of offending -  the more time the youth spent in the community rather than in custody, the higher the rate of offending, a result not surprising given that ‘time in the community’ equates with ‘opportunity to offend’.  For the stable low rate offenders, however, (24% of the original sample) more time in institutional care was associated with higher rates of offending.  Incarceration for them, it would seem, increased subsequent offending. In addition, ‘time in custody’ did not differentiate the two groups that started off with high rates of offending. The two high rate offending groups – those starting high and dropping off dramatically across the three year period (14% of the total sample) and those starting high and persisting with high rates of offending (9% of actual offending) -- spent almost exactly the same amount of time in custody., Hence the data show that “even within a sample of juvenile offenders that is limited to those convicted of the most serious crimes, the percentage who continue to offend consistently at a high level is very small… [Moreover] our ability to predict which high-frequency offenders desist from crime and which do not is exceedingly limited…” (p. 469-470) even though the researchers had a total of 22 measures on the youth (including psychological assessments), the youth’s family background, and peers.
 Conclusion. “The considerable heterogeneity in offending patterns in the immediate years after court involvement challenges the political rhetoric in juvenile justice and the popular and scientific fixation on identifying lifelong antisocial personality problems. These results do not support the view that serious offenders are headed toward a life of crime. Most, in fact, had very low levels of involvement during the entire 3-year follow-up period.  Furthermore, for these youths, “incarceration may not be the most appropriate or effective option, even for many of the most serious adolescent offenders.  Longer stays in juvenile facilities did not reduce reoffending; institutional placement even raised offending levels in those with the lowest level of offending” (Paper 2, p, 3)., References: Mulvey, Edward P., Laurence Steinberg, Alex R.

Parole decisions made by judges at the beginning of the day or immediately after a food break are dramatically more likely to be successful than those made immediately before a break.,"Making a series of complex decisions in a short period of time appears to “deplete individuals’ executive function and mental resources which can, in turn, influence their subsequent decisions” (p. 6889).  Studies on various forms of judgments would suggest that “making repeated rulings can increase the likelihood of judges to simplify their decisions…. [In the context of parole decisions] they will be more likely to accept the default, status quo outcome: deny a prisoner’s request” (p. 6892). Other research has demonstrated that executive function can be restored by breaks, short rests, and food intake., 1,112 decisions of 8 Israeli judges (6 male, 2 female) presiding in parole hearings in 4 prisons in Israel were examined. In making their decisions, the judges were advised by two others (a criminologist and a social worker), but they alone made the decisions.  Most decisions involved requests for release, though about 22% involved requests to change conditions.  Judges typically took a mid-morning break (and were provided with a snack) as well as a lunch break.  Decisions were coded as either ‘accept’ the request or reject it. About half the ‘rejected’ group included a stipulation to review the case at a later date., At the start of each session (i.e., the beginning of the day or after the morning break), about 65% of the rulings were favourable.  By the time the judge took a break, success had decreased to close to zero.  After each break, the likelihood of a favourable ruling returned to about 65% and then decreased dramatically and consistently over time.  This pattern was evident for prisoners who had served different amounts of time (ranging from less than a year to more than 3 years).  The pattern (less success until the next break) was similar for those serving their first prison sentence as well as for those with a prior incarceration.  A more detailed multivariate analysis confirmed the effect.  This analysis demonstrated, however, that, overall, other factors were taken into account in the judge’s decision. Those with previous imprisonments were less likely to be released, those who had participated in rehabilitation programs were more likely to be released, and those who appeared before judges whose first decision of the day was favourable were more likely to receive a favourable ruling.  This last finding suggests that some judges were, overall, more likely than others to hand down favourable rulings, but that the ‘order’ effect held for them as well., Judges, when deciding when a break would occur, did not know the nature of the upcoming cases.  The order of the cases was determined by the arrival time of the prisoner’s lawyer, not by the judge, and the lawyers were kept separate from the proceedings. In fact, lawyers could not arrange for their cases to be heard at any special time in relation to the breaks.   A survey of lawyers showed that they had no knowledge that there was an advantage of having their case heard after a break., Conclusion. “When judges make repeated rulings, they show an increased tendency to rule in favour of the status quo.  This tendency can be overcome by taking a break to eat a meal, consistent with previous research demonstrating the effects of a short rest, positive mood, and glucose on mental resource replenishment” (p. 6892).  It cannot be determined from this study whether the effect is due to the break, the food, or both.   However, it is clear that extraneous factors can affect judges’ decisions concerning the liberty of offenders.  “The caricature that justice is what the judge ate for breakfast might be an appropriate caricature for human decision-making in general” (p. 6892)., Reference: Danziger, Shai, Jonathan Levav, and Liora Avnaim-Pesso (2011).

When criminal justice interventions appear to be ‘too good to be true’ it is probably because the results being described are too good to be true.,", Previous research that has examined the quality of research designs used to evaluate crime prevention interventions has shown that weaker research designs tend to show stronger effects (see, for example, Criminological Highlights, 4(2)#8).  For example, simple “before vs. after” research designs that control for almost nothing (e.g., that do not control for other independent events occurring at the same time, trends that have nothing to do with the intervention, selection of different people or locations into the ‘treatment’ and ‘control’ groups, regression effects, maturation effects) tend to show stronger effects of a crime prevention intervention than do studies that have adequate controls., There is a large body of research evaluating the effectiveness of various surveillance methods – e.g., closed circuit television (CCTV) and improved street lighting – on crime.  A review of only high quality studies in these areas suggests, for example,  that CCTV is effective in certain situations (e.g., in automobile parking lots) and that improved street lighting is more effective in reducing property than violent crimes., In recent years, there have been 5 systematic reviews of public area surveillance studies that looked at a total of 136 separate evaluations.  Each of these studies was coded as finding the intended positive effect (that the intervention reduced crime), no effect (or an effect that was reported as being not statistically significant) or a negative effect (supporting the conclusion that the intervention was harmful).  Overall 49% of the studies showed the intended positive effect, 43% showed no effect, and 7% showed a negative effect., A common problem with research in this area is in not having an adequate control or comparison group: 37% of the studies did not have a comparison group, and an additional 19% had a non-comparable control group., Of the 60 studies that had a control group that was comparable to the group that received the intervention, 37% showed crime reducing effects of the intervention.  Of those studies with no control or a non-comparable control, 59% presented results that suggested that there were crime reducing effects of the intervention., The difficulty, of course, is that often the interventions that are studied are implemented in a manner that makes it difficult or impossible to evaluate them adequately.  In addition, those responsible for criminal justice interventions whose careers may well be affected by the outcome of evaluations of what they are doing may not have the motivation to carry out studies with fully adequate controls., Conclusion:  This study demonstrates that good design does matter: favourable results in criminal justice research are more likely to be shown in inadequately designed studies than in studies with adequate designs.  The presence of a randomized or comparable control group is almost always a necessary condition  for  drawing any inferences about the efficacy of a criminal justice intervention.  Studies without adequate designs cannot be taken seriously., Reference: Welsh, Brandon C., Meghan E.

Sentencing youths to life in prison without eligibility for parole is a popular public option for youths who murder for a very simple reason: Members of the public don’t know that there are plausible alternatives to this sanction.,", In 2005, there were an estimated 2,225 people in the U.S. serving life sentences without eligibility for parole (LWOP) for murders that they committed when they were 17 years old or younger.  A 2010 U.S. Supreme Court held that LWOP for any offence other than murder was unconstitutional. LWOP is a rare sanction for people of any age outside of the U.S.  A survey of 154 countries found only 3 that allowed this sanction for youths and they, in total, only had 12 youths serving these sentences., Other studies show that the public’s preference for harsh penalties decreases dramatically when alternative sanctions are offered as possibilities.  For example, support for the death penalty for adult murderers in the US decreases substantially if other options – e.g., life with a long parole ineligibility period or LWOP – are offered as alternatives., In Michigan, children of any age can be sentenced to LWOP in an adult prison, though depending on the age of the child, other options are also possible.  In a survey carried out in Michigan in 2005-6, respondents were first asked “How strongly do you agree or disagree with Michigan’s current law that requires an adolescent to be sentenced to life without parole for certain offences?”  43% agreed or strongly agreed with the law., In a follow-up question, respondents were asked which of six sentencing options they thought “an adolescent convicted of committing a homicide should receive as a punishment.”  When presented with a larger menu of choices, 5% favoured LWOP in an adult facility, and an additional 11% chose confinement in a juvenile facility until 18, and then LWOP. Hence a total of 16% favoured LWOP in one or the other of these forms. The most popular options involved confinement in a juvenile facility until 18, and then a prison sentence with the possibility of parole in 20 years (41%) or less than 20 years (25%).  An additional 5% preferred that the initial confinement be in an adult facility, but that parole would be possible after 20 years. 13% preferred confinement in a youth facility until age 21 and then release., In simple terms, however, the support for LWOP dropped from 43% of the respondents to 16%.    Support for LWOP was lower among females, African Americans, and those over 30 years old., Conclusion:  The results are consistent with other findings showing that when respondents are provided with a range of plausible sanction options, support for highly punitive options often decreases dramatically.  Other studies have shown that the public may talk tough in sentencing matters, but in fact wants mitigating factors to be considered when sentences are being imposed (Criminological Highlights 12(1)#4).  Similarly, Canadian respondents were much more favourable toward conditional sentences of imprisonment after they understood the nature of the punitive conditions that could be imposed under a conditional sentence (Criminological Highlights 3(3)#4).  The public supports mandatory minimum sentences, but, simultaneously would prefer that there be some mechanism to ‘opt out’ of the mandatory requirement (Criminological Highlights, 6(2)#6,  8(6)#1).  The findings in this and other studies suggest that politicians who prefer to follow their constituents rather than lead them would do well to ensure that those whom they are following have complete knowledge of the options that are available., Reference: Kubiak, Sheryl Pimlott and Terrence Allen (2011).  Public Opinion Regarding Juvenile Life Without Parole in Consecutive Statewide Surveys.

There are good reasons to believe that monitoring sex offenders with GPS devices will waste money and have no effect on reoffending.,", Most popular approaches to sex offender recidivism ignore what is known about sex offenders. Sex offenders are no more likely to reoffend than other offenders (Criminological Highlights 3(3)#3, 5(1)#4, 6(3)#3, 6(6)#8, 8(3)#8, 9(2)#5). Given that most sex offences are committed by people known to their victims, residence restrictions, registration and notification schemes are ineffective (Criminological Highlights, 4(1)#2, 5(6)#1, 7(4)#4, 8(6)#5, 9(2)#7), 10(3)#7, 11(4)#7, 11(6)#6)., This paper looks at one of the newer technological approaches to sex offence recidivism: GPS (global positioning system) monitoring of sex offenders (GPS-MSO).  GPS-MSO is obviously based on the notion that there are ‘safe’ and ‘dangerous’ places for sex offenders to be.  These approaches fail to notice that these restrictions, themselves, are inconsistent with what is known about sex offending (e.g., that it typically occurs between people known to one another) and, empirically, do not contribute to public safety., GPS-MSO has been proposed in some locations as the next stage of control of sex offenders in the community. However, what evidence there is on its effectiveness does not support the view that GPS-MSO is effective. Nevertheless, because it is ‘new’ and ‘high tech’ it is seen as ‘good.’ One problem, of course, is by treating all sex offenders the same, jurisdictions fail to discover whether there are any highly specified circumstances in which GPS-MSO could be useful., Public surveys suggest that the vast majority of ordinary citizens (who are likely not to be informed about basic facts concerning sex offences or sex offenders) say that they would feel safer if GPS-MSO were to be broadly instituted. This belief ignores findings such as the fact that the vast majority of sex crimes targeting children (96% in one study) are committed by people known to the victim.    These findings also ignore the fact that GPS technology does not stop someone from offending.  GPS technology can be used to determine – after the fact – where an offender has been. It can be checked at regular intervals (e.g. daily or weekly) to monitor compliance with conditions or, in the much more expensive version, it can involve constant real-time monitoring.  Both of these approaches involve a substantial amount of error (e.g., if a train carrying a sex offender were to pass close to a school or park that was ‘off limits’ because of the presence of children)., There are other concerns, however.  Rather than attempting to reintegrate sex offenders (see Criminological Highlights 9(3)#6, 11(2)#6) which can be effective at reducing recidivism, or provide effective treatment (Criminological Highlights 9(5)#7), GPS-MSO appears to be an effective way of funneling resources into unproven approaches.  Violation alerts – many being false alarms – occur frequently.  Furthermore, when they do occur, those given the task of monitoring must follow up, especially if the offender is subject to real-time monitoring. One agency with this task noted that “uncovering non-compliant behaviour patterns in GPS data is not always easy, but rather entails sifting through roughly 2 million data points per offender annually” (p. 184).  From the perspective of a community corrections office, if someone subject to GPS-MSO were about to commit an offence, it could be very difficult for those monitoring him to respond to an alert quickly enough to stop the offence from happening, especially given the number of false alarms., Conclusion: Almost certainly, “the incapacitative and public safety potential of this sanction has been overstated” (p. 185).  Proposals for its use are based on the notion that sex offending is caused by opportunity and location. “Most research, however, shows that sexual assaults of all types are rarely impulsive events; rather, offenders plan their assaults and use strategies to gain access to victims, acquire their trust, and commit the assault” (p. 185) – behaviours and crimes that would be unaffected by GPS monitoring., Reference: Payne, Brian K. and Matthew DeMichele (2011).  Sex offender policies: Considering unanticipated consequences of GPS sex offender monitoring.  Aggression and Violent Behaviour, 16, 177-187., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV12N2.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-12-no-2-%E2%80%93-october-2011,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 12, No. 2 – October 2011",Regular Issue,2011
One problem with sex offender residency restrictions is that they can make it impossible for a sex offender to find a legal place to live.,", Even though reoffending rates by sex offenders are not much different from reoffending rates of other offenders (See Criminological Highlights 3(3)#3, 5(1)#4, 6(3)#3, 6(6)#8) 8(3)#8, 9(2)#5), many jurisdictions have imposed special conditions on sex offenders who are released into the community.  Sex offence residence restrictions are now quite common even though they have been demonstrated to be ineffective (Criminological Highlights, 11(4)#7, 11(6)#6).  This paper demonstrates that ordinary residence restrictions placed routinely on sex offenders can also make it almost impossible for them to find a place to live., Residence restrictions are based on the theory that sex offenders commit their offences close to where they live, and that residency restrictions will keep offenders away from potential victims.  The problem is that the evidence does not support the view that re-offending, when it does take place, involves victims who live near the offender.  On the other hand it has been pointed out that “forcing offenders to live away from family, friends, and community resources can result in social isolation and difficulty reintegrating into the community” (p. 237).  Another problem is that ordinary restrictions (e.g., not living within 1000 feet of a location where children are likely to be found) mean that most parts of a city may be off-limits for sex offenders who have returned to the community., This study looks at two areas of New York State: Erie County and Schenectady County.  The restrictions on sex offenders vary across location and typically involve prohibitions against living  within 1000 to 2000 feet of schools, daycare centres, playgrounds, parks, and in the case of at least one municipality,  additional institutions such as libraries, skating rinks, and senior citizens’ residences., In this study, the targeted locations were identified, and the prohibited areas around them were identified. On the surface, these counties (which include rural and urban areas) would appear to have plenty of places for sex offenders to live:  Less than 20% of the total county area, and less than 25% of the space zoned for residences were off-limits.  However, when actual residences were examined, it was found that 89% of the residences in one county and 73% in the other were off-limits for sex offenders.  Only in rural areas (and, in one county, trailer parks) were the majority of residences legal for sex offenders.  In the two cities (Schenectady and Buffalo) 96% and 94%, respectively, of the actual residences were legally off limits to those who had been convicted of a sex offence., Registered sex offenders live in each of these two counties. Because they are required to register their residence with the police, it is straightforward to see if they live in restricted areas.  About 90% live in restricted areas, perhaps because they were resident there before the law was enacted in 2005.  But in addition, local police departments may not have the resources or motivation to enforce these restrictions (or even determine if they were resident in that location before 2005) in part because of the effort involved to amass the data needed to demonstrate proximity of the residence to a prohibited location.  It has also been suggested that these residence restriction laws were never meant to be enforced and were enacted purely for symbolic purposes., Conclusion:  In addition to not being effective in reducing reoffending, it would appear that residency restrictions that are imposed on sex offenders are largely unenforceable in part because they would leave sex offenders almost no place to live.  The problem, of course, is that residency restrictions – like public notification requirements – make it harder for sex offenders to reintegrate peacefully into the community., Reference: Berenson, Jacqueline A. and Paul S.

"Most drug courts have been shown to reduce recidivism, but their effectiveness depends on the characteristics of the offenders and the way in which drug courts are operated.",", There has been a large increase in the popularity of ‘drug courts.’  The evaluations of these courts tend to show that graduates have a somewhat lower likelihood of reoffending than those who are not given the opportunity to participate in drug courts. Part of the effectiveness of drug courts, of course, is that they connect offenders with treatment services.  At the same time, some drug courts have been criticized because drug addicted offenders are sometimes provided services sooner than more needy non-offenders.  It is clear that some drug courts work better than others. However, there has been little research on the factors that determine how effective a drug court is., In this paper, the characteristics of 76 distinct drug courts that had been evaluated were assessed using a combination of material in published reports and interviews with those knowledgeable about the operation of the courts. Overall it was estimated that without drug court intervention, the recidivism rate for offenders comparable to those who were sent to drug court would have been 54.5%.  These drug courts, on average, reduced this rate to 45.5%., Generally speaking, drug courts that exclude problem offenders (those with a history of non-compliance or violent offenders) are more successful than those that include these offenders, perhaps because such offenders are difficult to treat by any method that is available to a drug court.  Pre-adjudication drug courts were more effective than post-adjudication courts. “Drug courts are more effective when the benefit of graduation is avoiding conviction rather than avoiding a proscribed sanction” (p. 510).  Some drug courts with certain program requirements – restitution and education – were associated with better outcomes.  On the other hand, drug courts with other sorts of requirements – fines, community service, and employment – were associated with less favourable outcomes., Drug courts that require offenders to be in substance abuse treatment for longer periods of time seem to be associated with larger reductions in the rate of reoffending compared to drug courts that do not have such requirements.  Those drug courts requiring attendance at Alcoholics/Narcotics Anonymous were somewhat less effective at reducing recidivism than those that did not require this intervention.  Drug courts that bar offenders who fail a drug test from further participation in the drug court process were less effective than courts that had more flexible responses to failures on drug tests.   Drug courts that used many service providers, as well as drug courts that ran their own services, were more effective than those that used a small number of external service providers., Conclusions:  Though the drug courts that have been properly evaluated are, on average, somewhat effective in reducing the rate of reoffending by the offenders assigned to them, drug courts themselves vary on a number of different dimensions.  These separate dimensions in combination can  have a non-trivial  impact on the overall effectiveness of a drug court. Though most (78%) of the drug courts in this study reduced recidivism, some drug courts appeared to increase the reoffending of those sent to them.  It would appear that those who are designing drug courts, as well as those requesting funds to continue running existing drug courts, need to be constantly monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of what they are doing to ensure that their model of providing services is, in fact, the most effective one for the offenders who are assigned to them., Reference: Shaffer, Deborah Koetzle (2011).  Looking Inside the Black Box of Drug Courts: A Meta-Analytic Review.

Visits by parents to incarcerated youths can reduce the youth’s depressive symptoms even in cases in which the relationship between the parents and the youth is not good.,", Youths are especially at risk of experiencing depression when incarcerated because of stress that they experience in the absence of social support.  Youths report high rates of mental illness symptoms on arrival at custodial correctional facilities. Suicide and self-harm are most likely to occur during the early stages of incarceration., In general, social support of youths caught up in the youth justice system appears to act as a buffer against mental health problems.  From a policy perspective, however, there is a problem. It is known that family relationships for youths in the youth justice system tend to be especially problematic.  What is not known is whether in situations in which the parent-child relationships are not good, visits from parents are helpful to the youth., This study examined the effects of parental visits on 276 males, age 14-17 in a secure California juvenile correctional facility.  Youths were interviewed within 48 hours of their arrival at the facility, and then weekly for another 3 weeks, and then after they had been incarcerated for two months.  Depressive symptoms were assessed with a 20-item scale.  The youth’s relationship with his parents was assessed using a ‘warmth and acceptance’ scale with 8 questions (e.g., “He/She lets me know through words and actions that he/she really cares about me.”)  Most visits the youth received were from parents (54%), though about 29% were from brothers or sisters.  In the first week, youths were not allowed visitors. About 12% were never visited by a parent during their first two months in custody. In an average week, about half of the youths had a parental visit., Initially, those youths who subsequently received 0, 1, 2, or 3 or more visits per week did not differ in their depressive symptoms.  Over time, however, those youths who received parental visits experienced more rapid decline in their depressive symptoms compared to youths who did not receive visits from parents.  Youths who had good relationships with their parents showed lower levels of depression.  However, visits from supportive parents as well as visits from less supportive parents had similar effects: they lowered levels of depressive symptoms., Conclusion: “It appears that any parental visits, regardless of parent-adolescent relationship quality, serve to reduce depressive symptoms during the first two months of incarceration” (p. 150).  Thus it would appear that encouraging parental visits for all youths would be good policy.  This may be especially important in facilities in which parental visits are suspended as punishment for bad behaviour of the youth.  Given that youths who get into trouble may be more likely to be depressed than other youths, it would appear that parental visits may be especially important for them.  Parental visits probably do not occur for a large number of structural reasons related to the situations parents find themselves in. “Given the benefits of prison visitation [by parents] on youth psychological adjustment, it is imperative that policy assists in overcoming barriers to prison visitation such as geographic distance and lack of resources (e.g., finances, time off from work, transportation child care, etc.” (p. 150)., Reference: Monahan, Kathryn C., Asha Goldweber, and Elizabeth Cauffman (2011).

The decision of ordinary people to contact the police in response to crime and disorder depends on the nature of the community in which the problem arises.,", It is well established from ethnographic research and from victimization surveys that many people do not call the police when they witness crime or experience victimization.  Calling the police is a strategic decision: it has costs (e.g., risks associated with turning a dispute over to the police, risks associated with contact with police, time associated with being a witness) and it may or may not have any personal or social benefit.  This is a 3-year long ethnographic study of two neighbourhoods in Los Angeles, California. Ethnographic studies are “useful in describing processes that underlie activities like calls for service [which are] the outcomes of processes that are ordinarily hidden from the instruments of conventional research approaches” (p. 139)., In one neighbourhood that was studied – a high-density, primarily Latino neighbourhood – most residents would be described as the working poor.  They had migrated to the U.S. typically as ‘chains’ such that “each successive arrival is assisted in settling by predecessors…., creating relationships of sponsorship and reciprocity” (p. 140). People were accustomed to relying on others in various ways.  There were “wide-ranging and overlapping networks of communication” that were constantly developing.  Neighbourhood youths were not seen as dangerous, and although they were aware of crime, they seldom called the police, in part because of fear of retribution but also because they empathized with many of those involved in street crime (mainly drug-related crimes).  Although the police considered the neighbourhood to be high crime, residents reported having little fear of personal victimization. Another reason for not calling the police was that many were not yet legal immigrants.  Hence they sought other ways of dealing with problems within the neighbourhood rather than calling the police. Only the most serious matters lead to the police being called, and then, residents would often attempt to make the contact indirectly (e.g., through an apartment manager).  The police were generally seen as not being very useful, in that they were perceived as being unresponsive even when called., In the other location, residents came from a mixture of backgrounds and language groups, thus linguistically they were isolated from the majority of their neighbours.  The various groups identified their neighbourhood in different ways that were specific to their own ethnic backgrounds.  And the demographic character and lifestyles of the different groups were quite different.  Because the different groups had different lifestyles, the kinds of easy social relationships among all residents that existed in the first neighbourhood were absent in the second. Channels of communication operated along group lines and rarely crossed group lines.  Crime, then, especially for whites (23% of the population) was an important issue. Whites saw the police as public servants whose purpose was to deal with local issues. Calls to the police were often coordinated through their “Neighbourhood Watch” organization. Many calls related to ‘quality of life issues’ (e.g., noisy neighbours).  Other groups typically saw less reason to call the police., Conclusion: The idea behind ‘community policing’ is that the police should be responding to community problems and needs.  The risk, as demonstrated by the difference between these two neighbourhoods, is that the term ‘community’ may be invoked without knowledge of the range of variation in neighbourhoods. “In socially heterogeneous areas, where ‘community’ frequently means conflicting rather than common interests” (p. 159) responding to ‘the community’ can be problematic.  The differences between these two neighbourhoods in the manner in which they call in the police demonstrates that the ‘problems’ that the police hear about are filtered in quite different ways in the two neighbourhoods., Reference: Ibarra, Peter R.

Youths who immigrated to Canada are less likely to engage in crime than non-immigrants in large part because of their increased commitment to family and education.,"In the last quarter of the 20th century, immigrants to the Toronto area came primarily from Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. Prior to that, immigrants were primarily from Europe or North America.  In Canada, as in other countries, many people apparently believe that immigrants are disproportionately responsible for crime even though research suggests that immigrants generally are less likely to  be involved in crime than their native born counterparts (see Criminological Highlights¸V10N6#7, V8N3#5, V11N1#4).  In 1929, after reviewing the birth place of Canadian prisoners, a well-known Canadian lawyer wrote that “the foreigner is not doing so badly in Canada, and these figures unquestionably persuade us that it is not the foreign born citizen that is responsible for the Crime Problem in Canada… the real problem is inherently Canadian in its origin” (J.C. McRuer, K.C. General Session of the American Prison Association Annual Congress, Toronto, 1929).   This study reports findings on the relationship between immigration and crime at two somewhat later points in time – 1975 and 1999 – among youths in a suburban community of Toronto., Secondary school students were surveyed in the same schools in 1976 and 1999.  Youths were defined as immigrants if they came to Canada after age 12. The proportion of immigrant youths increased during this period, but more dramatic was the shift in origin of the immigrant youths.  Ethnicity was defined by the father’s origin.  In 1976, 60% were Anglo or North American and 30% were from elsewhere in Europe, leaving only 10% from Africa, the Caribbean, or any part of Asia.  In 1999, the immigrant community had changed dramatically: 24% were Asian, 13% were of African/Caribbean background, and 30% were from Southeast Asia or the Middle East, with only 34% from Anglo or European backgrounds.   Educational commitment was a combination of “engagement” (how important grades were to the student and how much time they spent on homework) and “expectations” (how far they expected to go in school).  Youths reported their use of illegal drugs as well as the frequency with which they committed theft, vandalism, car theft, and assault., Controlling for sex and socio-economic status, immigrant youths were less likely to engage in illegal activities than non-immigrant youths.  However, this effect disappeared when educational commitment, parental bonds, or grades in school were controlled for suggesting that the difference between immigrants and non-immigrants lies in the immigrants’ greater commitment to education and higher level of parental bonds.  None of the geographically-defined ethnic groups was more likely to be involved in delinquencies than non-immigrant groups. Furthermore, each of these ethnicity-specific effects appeared to be mediated by educational commitment or parental bonds., Conclusion:  “With investment in education comes a sense of commitment and a resulting stake in conformity [to societal norms] that makes these [immigrant] youths averse to [involvement in crime]” (p. 361).  The more recent immigrants – predominantly non-European - appear to have stronger family bonds and higher levels of commitment to education than non-immigrants.  The findings underline the importance of the conclusion that “immigration ought not be treated as causally determinative [of lower levels of crime] in isolation, but that it must instead be contextualized within the experiences, attachments and practices developed within families and schools” (p. 362)., Reference: Dinovitzer, Ronit, John Hagan, and Ron Levi (2009).

"For violent and theft-related offences, but not drug offences, White-Black differences in male arrest rates are accounted for by differences in exposure to risk factors years earlier.",", Racial discrepancies in the likelihood of being arrested have been found in many studies. Finding differences, however, does not explain why those differences exist.   This paper examines whether exposure to early “risk” factors – measured when male children were in Grade 2 – predicted juvenile arrests between 10-17 years old., Youths, parents and teachers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, provided information about the youths and their circumstances when the boys were about 8 years old.  These measures included measures of the youths’ conduct and psychological well-being, as well as measures of social disadvantage (e.g., neighbourhood problems, living in poverty). Contacts with the youth justice system were obtained from the local courts as well as the state court system., As in other studies, Black youths were more likely to be arrested for violent, property, and drug offences than were White youths. (There were too few other-race youths to be included in the sample.)  Arrest for a violent offence was generally related to all of the ‘risk factors’ experienced by the boy.   Theft-related arrests were less strongly related to the risk factors than were arrests for violent offences, and drug arrests were only marginally related to the risk factors., However, when the various risk factors were taken into account, race was no longer a predictor of violence-related arrests.  Factors such as low academic achievement, communication problems, peer delinquency, and neighbourhood problems accounted for the relationship between race and violence-related arrests.  Similarly, race did not predict theft-related arrests, once the various ‘risk’ factors were taken into account.  However, race still predicted drug arrests, even when ‘risk’ factors were taken into account., There are understandable reasons for the Black-White differences in drug arrest rates. “Black youths are generally more likely to obtain and use [illegal] substances in more public places” (p. 924).  In addition, police officers may be more likely to stop and search Black males. It is also possible that Black youths are more likely to be exposed to drug use in their homes and families., Conclusion:  It would appear that if a community is concerned about high rates of violent offending by Black male adolescents, there are things that can be done.  Interventions that target problems that are evident when boys are 8 years old would be likely to reduce arrests for violent offences, and to a lesser extent, theft-related offences.  For example, early targeting  of conflicted parent-child interactions and delinquent peers might well be effective ways of addressing arrests for violence later in life., Reference: Fite, Paula J., Porche’ Wynn, and Dustin A.

"The police have direct control over how favourably they are seen by crime victims.  Although victims generally think less favourably about the police than non-victims, the police can mitigate this effect by taking victims’ concerns seriously.",", It has been suggested that there are at least three somewhat distinct components of the community’s evaluation of the police: effectiveness in dealing with crime, fairness or integrity of the police, and police engagement with the community.  Using measures of each of these somewhat separate components of the public’s view of police, this paper examines the impact of different types of police-citizen contact on each of these constructs in a sample in London, England., One of the most common reasons for citizen-initiated contact with the police is that the citizen was a victim of crime.  The most important single determinant of citizens’ assessment of the quality of the contact with the police was whether the police appeared to take the citizen’s concerns seriously. Two other factors predicted citizen satisfaction with the specific contact they had with the police: whether the citizen believed that the police followed up on the call and whether the citizen thought that the time he or she had to wait for the police was reasonable., Both citizen- and police-initiated contact with the police were related to lower ratings of police effectiveness, even when the citizen was, overall, satisfied with the quality of the particular encounter.  Not surprisingly, people who had unsatisfactory recent contacts with the police were more likely to rate the police, generally, as being unfair and not involved with the community.   But victims’ contacts with police that were seen as favourable did have positive impacts on ratings of fairness and engagement of the police (compared to people who had not had recent contact with the police)., Perhaps the most important findings are those that suggest that individual police officers can enhance the overall ratings of the police.  When crime victims believe that their concerns are being taken seriously by the police, they see police as not only being more engaged in the community, but also as more fair and effective.   When the police follow up in any way with the crime victim, ratings of effectiveness and community engagement are higher., Conclusion:  The data suggest that individual officers can either enhance or damage perceptions that the public holds of the police.  “While opinions about police effectiveness may be challenged by any contact – whether it is satisfactory or unsatisfactory - ideas about fairness and community engagement appear to be amenable to change in either a positive or a negative direction” (p. 41).  “Fairness and community engagement … are the aspects of overall confidence [in the police] that are most related to personal treatment during the [police-citizen] encounter” (p. 42).  Effectiveness in dealing with crime, on the other hand, is largely out of the control of the individual officer who interacts with the public, although police officers who communicate that the citizen’s victimization is being taken seriously can have a positive impact even on this dimension of effectiveness., Reference: Bradford, Ben, Jonathan Jackson, and Elizabeth A.

Uniformity of sentences is not an appropriate goal for the sentencing process.,", Excessive structuring of sentences can occur in various ways.  Legislatures can mandate fixed or mandatory minimum sentences for certain offences. Alternatively, rigid guidelines can be constructed that do not take into account the complexity of the behaviour that needs to be considered in determining a proportional sentence.   Sentences, therefore, can be excessively similar.  Guidelines are often justified as mechanisms designed to reduce unwarranted variation in sentences.  In doing so, they may create unwarranted uniformity., This paper examines drug sentencing under the U.S. federal guidelines.  Those guidelines were made somewhat more restrictive by the fact that the U.S. Congress imposed a number of mandatory minimum sentences on drug offences at the time the guidelines were developed.  The guidelines used the mandatory minimum as the starting point.  In addition to the criminal record of the accused, the main basis for sentences harsher than the minimum is the quantity of the drug that is the focus of the offence.  This means that the role the offender played in the drug process is given no explicit importance in determining the offence.  Different drugs are made “equivalent” by conversions into “marijuana-equivalent” amounts of each drug.  Furthermore, sentences can not be reduced substantially by mitigating factors, and, often, it is only the more important people in the overall drug-selling process who have the information that allows for a lesser sentence (on the basis that they had relevant information to provide to prosecutors in return for more lenient treatment)., This study examines sentences of 1259 inmates in U.S. federal correctional facilities who were imprisoned for drug offences (most commonly powder and crack cocaine, marijuana, and methamphetamine).  Drug quantity was the strongest predictor of the sentence, as would be expected from the guidelines.  Notwithstanding the drug ‘equivalence’ calculations included in the guidelines, offenders serving sentences for marijuana offences received somewhat shorter sentences.  Those who went to trial got harsher sentences, especially those found guilty by a jury.  In addition, even after controlling for criminal record, drug quantity, drug type, and other legal factors, Black offenders received harsher sentences, as did males, older offenders, and those with lower levels of education., The most important finding, however, was that the offender’s role in the offence – simple possession, street selling, wholesaling, producing, importing, or laundering money related to drugs, had no impact on sentences. Said differently, an offender who was merely in possession of a certain amount of drugs for his or her own use was treated as equivalent to someone with a more central role in the drug trade who happened to be sentenced for the same amount of drugs.  The quantity of drugs that was the subject of the sentence was, interestingly enough, independent of the person’s role in the drug trade., Conclusion:  The study demonstrates what can happen to sentencing when rules become excessively rigid.  In this case “quantity-driven sentencing, coupled with culpability-based adjustments that are too limited in scope, leads to excessively uniform sentences for offenders of widely differing culpability and responsibility for the drug trade” (p. 172).  This fact, combined with the finding that other legally irrelevant factors such as race still affect sentence length, suggest that there are serious problems that need addressing in these guidelines and, perhaps, in other rigid guideline systems. Alternatively, of course, it could be that these were the effects desired by those who designed the guidelines., Reference: Sevigny, Eric L. (2009). Excessive Uniformity in Federal Drug Sentencing.

"The selling of marijuana in Dutch “coffee shops” reflects a local, but somewhat unstable, official tolerance that allows a focus on “safety and security instead of moral differences” (Buruma, p. 108).",", The selling of small amounts of marijuana in “coffee shops” has made the Netherlands a popular destination for certain tourists.  Though the law on the books does not allow possession or sales of marijuana, the sale and consumption of small amounts is tolerated in these shops as part of an overall orientation that focuses more on pragmatic than on moral concerns. The issue of how the selling of marijuana can simultaneously be illegal and officially tolerated in certain circumstances raises interesting questions about the meaning of law and the enforcement of it., In 1976, Dutch law first differentiated ‘hard’ from ‘soft’ drugs.  This distinction was based, in part, on the policy objective of ‘harm reduction.’  Users of marijuana were not seen as being at risk of social exclusion nor were they seen as being a particular threat to anyone.  The focus was on regulation rather than prohibition. Since the 1980s, marijuana was sold in “coffee shops” in certain parts of certain cities.  There were, however, important restrictions.  Only small amounts could be sold and at least theoretically only relatively small amounts could be kept in these locations.  The view was that “the criminal justice system should be used only against criminal entrepreneurs” (Buruma, p. 90)., This is not to say, however, that the selling and consuming of marijuana is generally tolerated in all parts of the Netherlands.  It is estimated that coffee shops are not tolerated in 78% of Dutch municipalities. Regulation appears to be local and, to some extent, regional, even though the laws governing drugs are national.   It is understood that the existing coffee shops will be left alone if they don’t advertise, don’t sell hard drugs, have only small quantities of marijuana on the premises, don’t sell to minors, and generally aren’t seen as a problem.  Nevertheless, it is estimated that between the early 1990s and 2007, the number of coffee shops dropped from about 1500 to about 700., Estimates of the size of the ‘drug problem’ would suggest that the Netherlands has less of a drug problem than other European countries and “The Netherlands does not have significantly higher cannabis use than other European countries….The estimated prevalence of problem users of hard drugs… is the lowest per thousand inhabitants in western Europe” (Buruma, p. 91)., Though there may well be changes in the number of coffee shops across the Netherlands in the next few years, the more complex issue that their existence raises has to do with European drug policy.  Coffee shops are seen as an obstacle to future European convergence in this policy area.  Even now, the border towns create very different problems from those in the large cities. But in addition, local policies on enforcement are changing.  Some of the large cities, for example, are planning on closing down coffee shops near schools., Conclusion: “To speak of Dutch coffee shop policy is increasingly a misnomer: policy is regional and locally coloured” (Pakes, 256) even though the law governing drugs is national. Coffee shop policy (or at least practice) is affected by international (largely European) concerns, national policies and traditions of tolerance, and local concerns., References: Buruma, Ybo (2007).

A multi-site replication of a high intensity community program reduces recidivism for sex offenders after release from penitentiaries.,", Sex offenders are frequently said to have high rates of recidivism, especially for sexual offences.  The major problem with that belief is that it is not supported by available data  (see Criminological Highlights, 9(2)#5, 8(3)#8, 6(6)#8, 6(3)#3, 5(1)#4, 3(3)#3), 9(3)#6).  Furthermore, even though many people appear to believe otherwise, certain kinds of treatment programs for sex offenders appear to be effective (Criminological Highlights 9(5)#7).  One such program is “Circles of Support and Accountability” [COSA] (Criminological Highlights 9(3)#6). This paper reports on a 7-location replication of an evaluation of this program., The COSA program is very intensive. A group of 4-6 ordinary citizens (who have received special training) volunteers to work with a ‘core member’ – a sex offender released from a penitentiary at the end of his sentence.  During the first 2-3 months after an offender is released from penitentiary, the offender meets with at least one volunteer circle member every day. Other circle members meet individually with the offender at least once per week.  In addition, they meet as a group at least once per week. “A COSA is a relationship scheme based on friendship and accountability for behaviour” (p. 415).  Circles continue to meet regularly with their “core member” for months or, in some cases, years after his release from penitentiary., This paper examines COSAs that were organized in seven Canadian locations in 6 provinces.  Forty-four offenders who volunteered to participate in COSAs were matched with other sex offenders who were also released at the end of their sentences (i.e., with no legally mandated supervision). Matching criteria included various recidivism-predicting measures, measures of sexual deviance, age, participation in programming in prison, and the date and location of the release.  Obviously this is not a perfect comparison group in that the comparison group members were not given an opportunity to volunteer to participate in COSAs.  However, their backgrounds, experiences, and treatment in penitentiary, etc., appeared to be relatively comparable to the COSA members., During the 3-year follow-up period, significantly fewer (5) of the 44 (11%) COSA offenders re-offended than in the comparison group (17 of the 44 or 39%).  Looking at violent (including sexual offences), a significantly higher proportion of the comparison group (34%) reoffended compared to the COSA treatment group (9%).  Very few offenders in either group committed sexual offences (1,  or 2%, in the COSA group and 6, or 14%, in the comparison group) a difference that was not significant at the 5% level., It is not known exactly why COSAs are effective, but it is likely that it relates to the social support and the positive social influences of the group on the offender. The success may also be a result of the help circle members give with fundamental problems such as housing and employment.  But in addition, “with its concurrent focus on accountability on the part of the offender, it targets issues related to distorted cognitions that support offending and minimize risk….” (p. 426)., Conclusion. Circles of Support and Accountability, an intensive program for sex offenders released from penitentiary, appear to reduce subsequent offending. As is clear from numerous other studies, sex offenders can be treated and their reoffending rates – which initially were not very different from re-offending rates of other offenders – can be reduced significantly., Reference:  Wilson, Robin J., Franca Cortoni, and Andrew J.

Nineteen states in the U.S. have initiated policies designed to reduce imprisonment levels. Twenty states reduced their rates of imprisonment in 2008.,", Even before the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008, “Legislators in many states had become increasingly interested in adopting evidence-based policies directed at producing more effective public safety outcomes” (p.1). Motivation for these changes varied, but in many instances the change in orientation was driven by the high costs and little benefit of high imprisonment policies. The changes in policy focused largely on strategies to reduce the use of imprisonment and to reduce the time people sentenced to prison actually spend there. For the most part, states undertook a range of different strategies to use public safety resources more effectively.  In some cases, the reductions in imprisonment rates were dramatic. In the 10 years ending in 2009 there was a 20% reduction in the imprisonment rate in New York  and  a 19% reduction in New Jersey.  In Michigan, there was a 19% reduction in imprisonment in the 3 years ending in 2009. The following are examples of these how these changes were accomplished., Sentencing reforms.  Some mandatory minimum sentences were eliminated (e.g., changes to the Rockefeller Drug Laws in New York in 2003). With apparent support of the public, minor drug offenders previously sent to prison in NY were diverted to community based drug rehabilitation programs. Offenders were sometimes offered shorter ‘boot camp’ programs as an alternative to the long prison sentences already imposed on them. A substantial portion of the drop in the number of drug offenders admitted to prison apparently came as a result of prosecutorial discretion rather than changes in the law.  In Michigan, the abolition of mandatory minimums occurred with the support not only of judges but prosecutors.  In 1998, 20% of Michigan’s drug offenders were sent to prison. By 2008, this had dropped to 11%.  Certain aspects of the drug laws in New Jersey were also made more flexible., The development of early release programs. In New York, many prisoners were allowed to be released after serving less than their minimum term of imprisonment.  In Michigan, release procedures were improved.  Those seeking early release had been required, since 1992, to prove that they were not risks.  Given that risk was assessed largely on the basis of offence and offence history – factors that are not amenable to change by the offender while in prison – it is not surprising that few were released. By shifting responsibility to local teams who were required to address the dynamic needs of those released, many more people were granted parole (19,000 in 2000 and 25,000 in 2008). Beginning in 2009, the state began re-considering, largely on the basis of risk assessment scores, some of those previously refused parole.  In New Jersey, when risk assessment instruments were introduced, staff were told that when something ‘bad’ happened (e.g., a serious offence by someone who was released), they would not be blamed if they had acted reasonably with the information that was available to them., Reducing the use of revocations. Many of those who committed technical violations of their release conditions now are able to remain in the community.  In Kansas, for example, county agencies that supervised offenders were told that funds would be made available to their agency if parole violations were reduced by at least 20%., Conclusion.  Prison populations can be controlled in large part by ensuring that sentences can be imposed that reflect the actual seriousness of the offence and by ensuring that evidence-based release and revocation decisions are made.  The elimination of mandatory minimums – especially for less serious but high volume drug offences – appears to be an important lever that can be used to reduce prison populations. However, states with relatively high incarceration rates have been successful in reducing prison populations in part because of the large number of people who, from almost any perspective, did not need to be in prison in the first place., Reference: Greene, Judith, and Marc Mauer (2010).

"For some Americans, the experience of going to prison increases the likelihood both that they will identify themselves as Black and that others will see them as Black.",", When O.J. Simpson was charged in 1994 with murder, Time magazine ran a doctored ‘mug shot’ of him on its cover in which his skin colour had been purposely darkened.  With Blacks in America vastly over-represented in prison, Time could be seen as having provided additional support for the association between crime and race. This paper examines the hypothesis that “incarceration affects both how respondents identify themselves and how they are perceived by others” (p. 92). Specifically, it examines whether those who had been to prison are more likely to identify themselves as black, and if others are more likely to see them as black., This study took advantage of the manner in which ‘race’ data were collected in the U.S. National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the fact that many respondents, during the period of the survey, were incarcerated at one or more points between their first interview in 1979 and 2002.  Respondents in the survey identified their own race in 1979 and then again in 2002 (when the form of the question changed as a result of federal standards for collecting information on race/ethnicity).   Interviewers, however, were instructed to classify respondent’s race at the end of each annual interview.  The independent variable – experience of being imprisoned – was captured according to whether the respondent was interviewed while in prison., Of those who described themselves as of European origin in 1979, 95% described themselves as white in 2002 if they were interviewed out of prison at that time.  However, if they were interviewed in prison in 2002, only 81% identified themselves as white.  Of those who identified themselves as non-European in origin in 1979, 74% of those interviewed in prison said that they were black in 2002.  In contrast, 59% of those who identified themselves as of non-European origin in 1979 but were not in prison in 2002 identified themselves as black.  Simply put, “incarceration leads to an increase in the likelihood of self-identifying as black and a decrease in the likelihood of self-identifying as white.”, Similar effects were found for the interviewer’s assessment of the race of the respondent.  Looking first at those who were identified as white in the previous year, if the respondent was not interviewed in prison, 96% were classified by the interviewer as white.  If the interview took place in prison, however, only 90% were classified as white.   Interestingly enough, the effect was not due solely to the location of the interview.  Looking only at those interviewed outside of prison, of those who were classified as white the previous year, 96% of those who had never been incarcerated were classified by the interviewer as white.  However, of those who, at some point in the past had been incarcerated, only 92% were classified as white., Conclusion.  It is not clear what the mechanism is for either of these findings.  It may be that with certain prison systems having large numbers of black inmates, ‘being black’ is, in fact, a more comfortable identity for reasons such as personal safety. Inmates who might ‘pass’ as either white or black choose black.  The effect of incarceration on classification by the interviewer could be a result of changes in the respondent (e.g., in appearance or presentation by the respondent) or it could be that interviewers, themselves, associate race with imprisonment. It would appear, therefore, that racial identification and classification are not static, but are “continually negotiated in everyday interactions” (p. 109)., Reference: Saperstein, Aliya and Andrew M. Penner (2010).  The Race of a Criminal Record: How Incarceration Colors Racial Perceptions.  Social Problems, 57(1), 92-113., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV11N2.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-11-no-2-%E2%80%93-may-2010,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 11, No. 2 – May 2010",Regular Issue,2010
It is impossible to predict at an early age who will turn out to be a ‘high rate’ or serious offender.  What can be predicted is that people become less likely to re-offend as they grow older no matter what their early pattern of offending looks like.,"There is a good deal of research demonstrating that offenders are typically relatively young and that even relatively high rate offenders eventually slow down or stop offending (see, e.g., Criminological Highlights 6(4)#3).  However, some policy makers appear to believe that because, in retrospect, it can be shown that a small portion of the population was responsible for a disproportionate amount of past offending, early identification and incapacitation of high rate offenders would be an effective crime control strategy.  Such a belief is based on a lack of understanding of the problem of predicting rare events., This paper focuses on an interesting sample: all of those convicted of criminal offences in the Netherlands in 1977. It then examines their previous offending patterns as well as their offending for the next 25 years.   From a practical perspective, then, it allows one to answer two questions: (1) What are the various ‘patterns’ of offending of those who are in contact with the criminal justice system?  (2) Can one predict with any useful level of accuracy who, in the future, is likely to be a high rate offender?, Starting with those who were convicted in 1977, and looking back to records of offending from age 12 onwards and forward for decades, there was, not surprisingly, a relatively early peak in the overall offending rate of this group in the late teens and early 20s and a gradual dropoff after that.  The rate of violent offending was, as is normally the case, somewhat flatter, but did show a gradual decrease with age.  Those offenders whose offending careers began relatively early in life (age 15 or younger, or, in a separate analysis, age 13 or younger) obviously had, overall, higher rates of offending. However, the shape of the curve was the same as that of other offenders: peaking in early adulthood followed by a decline thereafter.  Similar declines were found for those who were early and high rate offenders: rates of offending dropped off after the late teens or early 20s., When offenders were divided into four groups (according to their patterns of offending) there were some differences across groups.  Chronic offenders (the 4% of the group with relatively high rates of offending throughout their 20s and 30s), were more likely to have started offending early in life at a high rate, to have a low IQ,  and to have been assessed as unstable psychologically.  One might think, therefore, that they could be accurately identified in advance. That turns out not to be the case., In a two stage validation study, a descriptive model identified a small group of ‘low rate offenders’ (14% of the total sample) – those who continue offending at a low rate for relatively long periods of time.   However, the best predictive model that would have been available to identify them would have picked out only 3 out of 328 of them.  More important was the inability to identify the ‘chronic offenders’ – those with relatively high rates of offending for long periods of time.  Of the 84 who were identified as such on the basis of actual offending patterns over their whole lives, only two could have been identified in advance using the best predictive model that would have been available when they were young., Conclusion:  The results are consistent with previous findings demonstrating the futility of trying to predict in advance which offenders are likely to be high rate or chronic offenders.  Although certain factors (e.g., low intelligence and psychological instability) predict early onset and chronic offending to some extent, the ability of factors such as these to identify high rate offenders is extremely limited.  Hence policies based on early identification and treatment (or incapacitation) of high rate offenders are doomed to failure., Reference:  Bersani, Bianca E., Paul Nieuwbeerta, and John Laub (2009)  Predicting Trajectories of Offending over the Life Course: Findings from a Dutch Conviction Cohort.  Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency, 46 (4), 468-494., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV11N3.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-11-no-3-%E2%80%93-july-2010,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 11, No. 3 – July 2010",Regular Issue,2010
The ways in which communities respond to offending by young people typically do not reflect what is known about youth crime.,", Western countries vary considerably in the manner in which they respond to offending by young people.  In addition, communities vary in the programs and policies that they have in place that have an impact on youth crime. This paper examines four lessons that should be learned concerning the manner in which juvenile justice systems might be structured.  The ‘lessons’ are based on the findings of a large study of Edinburgh youth that examined, among other things, self-reported offending., The first important fact youth justice systems need to take into account is that “persistent serious offending is associated with victimization and social adversity” (p. 185).  Violent offenders, for example, were found to have been more likely to experience a range of problems prior to being identified as offenders.  These included economic deprivations, problems at school, various health related problems (e.g., alcohol or drug use, self-harm) and crime victimization as children.  The exact factors varied somewhat for girls and boys. Though some of these risk factors are structural (e.g., social deprivation), others relate to interactions with peers, families and other adults.  These findings would suggest that if one were interested in reducing persistent serious offending, broad based interventions directed at improving the lives of children (generally) would be important., Second, the study demonstrates that early intervention of at-risk children is not likely to be very helpful and may, in fact, increase the likelihood of offending. Only a third of those involved in persistent serious offending at age 17 (according to their self-reports) were ever known to the social work or youth justice systems.  On the other hand, most of those who had been convicted of an offence by age 17 had been formally identified as being ‘at risk’ prior to age 15 and nevertheless ended up in the criminal justice system. Being identified as having problems does not mean that these problems can be eliminated. Indeed being labelled as an ‘at-risk’ child is likely to create a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Of the 105 youths identified with behavioural problems by age 5, between a quarter and a third of them were persistent serious offenders between age 13 and 17., Third, there are ways in which interventions might be effective.  Early onset offenders who continued to offend after about age 15 differed from those whose offending rates decreased. One important difference related to their experiences at school.  Being excluded from school at some point between age 13 and 15 appears to be a key way in which society can increase offending by those at risk. Formal involvement with the police also seemed to increase subsequent offending.  Hence, as other studies have suggested, a focus on schools may be more effective than a focus on ‘bad’ youths and youth justice interventions., Finally, diversionary strategies facilitate (or, minimally, do not inhibit) the process by which youths stop offending. Because police in Scotland often (but not always) divert youths away from the formal youth justice system, the study was able to examine the impact of formal contact with the youth justice system, while controlling for previous contact with the police and earlier involvement in crime.  “The deeper young people who were [known to the police] penetrated the youth justice system, the more likely it was that their pattern of desistance from involvement in serious offending was inhibited” (p. 198)., Conclusion. These findings “highlight the importance of case work [with youths] focused on welfare needs and of educational inclusion rather than more narrowly circumscribed criminogenic needs…” (p. 200).  In political debates it is often suggested that there is an “irreconcilable tension between tackling the broader needs of young offenders and delivering justice for communities and for victims of crime… [Clearly] these are not alternative strategies…” (p. 202). Providing reasonable policies for youth serves community and victims’ interests., Reference: McAra, Lesley and Susan McVie (2010).  Youth Crime and Justice: Key Messages from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime.

When the police directly provide citizens information about neighbourhood crime and disorder issues their reputation is enhanced.,", It is well-established that the police rely on the public for information in order to carry out policing responsibilities successfully.  Such a statement implies, however, that direct communication of information about crime is only in one direction – from the citizen to the police.  At the same time, however, “Trust, confidence, and legitimacy [with respect to the police] are … vital not only on normative or ethical grounds but because they foster support and cooperation.  The extent to which people have trust in the police and [view the police as being legitimate] will impact on their propensity to cooperate with, and defer to, officers across the whole range of policing activity…. Trust and legitimacy are developed through and expressed by police activities – treating people with fairness, dignity and respect – that communicate to people shared group membership with the police” (p. 492)., This study looks at a simple question: How can the police communicate effectively with the public in such a way that their reputation among members of the public is enhanced?  Separate and distinct newsletters for each of three London (England) wards were developed. These came directly from the police and contained information about local crime and disorder issues and outlined what steps the police were taking to deal with these concerns. The communications made it clear that the police were aware of local issues.  Details about how people could talk to the local police team were included.  The overall purpose of the newsletter was not to ‘educate’ the public about the police. Rather it was designed to inform people about what the police were doing at the local level., The newsletter was distributed in three London wards (the test wards) during another larger survey such that, on a random basis, one group of citizens was interviewed prior to the distribution of the newsletter and another group was interviewed afterwards. In addition, people in four separate ‘control’ wards were interviewed at the same times to ensure that changes could not be attributed to events that might occur around the same time as the distribution of the newsletter from the police., Overall confidence that the police were doing a good job in the local area increased in the wards in which the newsletter had been distributed. Confidence in the police did not change in the control wards.   Similar results were found (improvement in the test wards but not in the control wards) for ‘police community engagement’ (whether the police can be relied on to be there when needed; views that the police understood the community, etc.).   In both the test and control wards, ratings of police effectiveness decreased, but the decrease was considerably larger in the control wards.  This overall drop appears to have occurred because of accusations of racism and news stories about stabbings that appeared in the London newspapers. What is important, however, is that the decrease in police effectiveness was less for the test wards than in the control wards.  There was no effect on the perception of police fairness, which may be because this dimension was not relevant to the message in the newsletter and that the public assesses this on the basis of direct (or vicarious) contact with the police., Conclusion: Clearly the dissemination by the police of specific information about crime and disorder and police activities in local areas can affect the public’s assessment of the police.  At the same time, “there is an inherent risk that successes [in these communications] will be exaggerated and… that failures will be [ignored]” (p. 508).  In the newsletters distributed by the police in this study, the information was designed to be directly relevant to local residents. It was not general ‘public relations’ information about the police., Reference: Hohl, Katrin, Ben Bradford, and Elizabeth A. Stanko (2010).

The reasons people confess to crimes they haven’t committed are now known. Knowledge of the relevant factors can be used to reduce the likelihood of a false confession and to identify cases in which they are more likely to occur.,", It is estimated that about a fifth of convictions of those subsequently exonerated as a result of DNA evidence are based on false confessions or admissions.  Indeed, false confessions are among the leading causes of wrongful convictions, the others being eyewitness misidentification, faulty forensic science, and false informant testimony., The problem of false confessions starts with the fact that interrogations by police are not generally designed to discern the truth, but rather to “elicit incriminating statements, admissions, and perhaps a full confession in an effort to secure the conviction of offenders” (p. 6).  Interrogation methods are “stress-inducing by design – structured to promote a sense of isolation and increase the anxiety and despair associated with denial relative to confession” (p. 6).  Said differently, interrogations are designed to induce defendants to say what the police want them to say, not to tell the police what happened. Warnings concerning the right to silence have not been shown to reduce the incidence of confessions, in part because many accused people, especially adolescents, do not adequately apply the warning to their own situations.  False confessions appear to be most likely to be given by youths and those suffering some form of mental impairment., “Today’s interrogators seek to manipulate a suspect into thinking that it is in his or her best interest to confess” (p. 12) in one of two ways: by using a “cluster of tactics designed to convey the interrogator’s rock-solid belief that the suspect is guilty and that all denials will fail” and/or by “providing the suspect with moral justification and face-saving excuses for having committed the crime in question” (p. 12). These techniques may or may not involve deception., Three risk factors have been identified for false confessions: First, long interrogation times (typically, obviously, in unfamiliar settings and isolated from all external contact). Second, the presentation of false evidence that drives people to see a particular outcome as inevitable. “At times, American police will overcome a suspect’s denials [of guilt] by presenting supposedly incontrovertible evidence of his or her guilt… even if such evidence does not exist. In the U.S. it is permissible for police to outright lie to suspects about the evidence… – a tactic that is recommended in training [manuals]” (p. 17).  Evidence from controlled experiments and from studies of actual interrogations support the conclusion that false evidence can increase dramatically the rate of false confessions. Third, it would also appear likely that “people who stand falsely accused tend to believe that truth and justice will prevail and that their innocence will become transparent to investigators, juries, and others” (p. 22).  Innocent people, therefore, are to be more likely to waive their rights of silence and to submit ‘voluntarily’ to interrogation.  “People have a naïve faith in the power of innocence to set them free” (p. 23), and therefore say whatever is necessary to end a stressful interrogation assuming that others will be able to see that the confession is false.  Ironically, of course, this means that those who have most faith in the fairness of the criminal justice system are, in fact, most vulnerable to its errors., Conclusion: In the end, the problem with false confessions is that “once a suspect confesses, police often close their investigation and deem the case solved” (p. 23).  Police – like non-police – have been shown to be quite poor in determining whether someone is telling the truth. Given that the conditions likely to lead to false confessions are known, it is possible both to reduce their numbers and to provide police, prosecutors, and courts with information that will allow them to make more accurate decisions on the basis of confessions that are made., Reference: Kassin, Saul M., S.A.

The recidivism rate of young violent men who are released from prison can be reduced.,", Although imprisoning offenders is seen by many politicians to be a good way to reduce crime, it has three large problems: it is expensive and inefficient (see, e.g., Criminological Highlights, V3(1)#1); it may increase subsequent offending (e.g.,  Criminological Highlights 11(1)#1, 11(1)#2); and eventually most prisoners are released.  This paper addresses the third problem: what can be done to reduce subsequent offending by serious violent offenders being released from jails., The Boston Reentry Initiative (BRI) initiates contact with jailed inmates within 6 weeks of their entering the Suffolk County House of Correction.  Inmates are chosen for the project on the basis of assessments (objective and subjective) that they are at high risk of involvement in violent crime upon release.  Factors used to choose candidates included current offence, arrest history, gang membership, whether the inmate is from a violent neighbourhood or is seen to be likely to be involved in firearms incidents in the future., While in jail, inmates meet with representatives of criminal justice agencies (e.g., prosecution, probation, parole departments), social service agencies, and faith-based organizations.  The representatives of these organizations explain the services they could provide inmates upon release. Inmates are then assigned staff caseworkers and faith-based mentors from the community. Mentors’ salaries are paid by the program and typically stay connected with BRI participants for 1-1.5 years. A plan for release is developed for each inmate, and enrolments in programs (in jail) are chosen to meet each inmate’s needs.  On release, arrangements are made for the inmate to be met by a family member or a mentor at the door of the jail., In this study, the average inmate, upon release, had 7.3 contacts with mentors and about 40 hours of programming in the community. Services in the community included such matters as obtaining shelter, clothing, a job, counselling, etc.  Inmates were steered to ‘community partners’ (e.g., career centres, half-way houses) that had proved to be successful in linking inmates to jobs and communities.  A somewhat imperfect control group was created consisting of jailed inmates who were matched to the treatment inmates on their propensity-to-offend scores (based on age, race, current offence, criminal history,  and gang involvement)., Within a year of release 20% of the BRI participants and 35% of the comparison group had been arrested for a violent crime.  36% of the BRI participants and 51% of the comparison group were arrested for any crime within a year.  These differences – less offending by program participants – were evident two and three years after release., Conclusion:  Compared to many correctional programs, this program was unusual on at least two dimensions: It targeted difficult offenders who were expected to have a relatively high recidivism rate and, similar to some other programs for offenders who are a concern to many citizens (e.g., see Criminological Highlights, 9(3)#6, 11(2)#6), it was very intensive.  Nevertheless, it does demonstrate that programs aimed at those released from prison on some form of conditional release can be effective., Reference: Braga, Anthony A., Anne M.

"In criminal cases, decisions by U.S. federal female judges are more likely to favour the accused if the judge hears cases in a city with large numbers of other female federal judges.",", It has long been suspected that characteristics of judges have some effect on the decisions that they make.  Thus, for example, there is some evidence that in certain types of cases, the decisions by women are somewhat different from the decisions made by men in comparable cases. This paper examines the possibility that women will only make judicial decisions that are different from those made by men when there is a critical mass of other women judges in the same workplace., The theory behind this hypothesis is straightforward: an isolated woman will be influenced largely by those around her.  But “once a certain level of minority representation… has been reached, group interactions will change and substantive differences in the behaviour of the involved groups will begin to emerge…. Once minority groups reach [a] critical mass, their members will become more assertive in their shared interests and perspectives, and, consequently exhibit more distinctive behaviour” (p. 264)., The study looks at decisions made by federal (district) court trial judges between 1977 and 2000 that were published in the Federal Supplement.  Cases that are published are “intended to reflect those disputes that have substantial import beyond the parties to litigation” (p. 276) and are therefore more likely to involve ‘legal’ than ‘factual’ matters.  In criminal cases, the outcome was coded as favouring the accused (‘liberal decisions’) or favouring the prosecutor (‘conservative decisions’).  (Other types of cases (civil rights and labour/economics) were also examined, but won’t be discussed here).  Various control variables were used including an estimate of the judge’s ideology (based on the political views of those responsible for the appointment), the ideological orientation of the appeals courts under which each judge operates, and whether the judge was a member of a minority group., Judges’ own ideologies had a clear impact: judges estimated to be more conservative were more likely to favour the prosecution.  Minority judges were more likely to render liberal decisions than were white judges.  Holding all other variables constant, it was found that as the number of female judges in a specific court location increased, female judges became more likely to hand down decisions favouring the accused .  For criminal matters, there was no difference between the decisions of male and female judges if only one or two female judges worked at a particular location. However, “at a court [location] with four women, a female judge is 7% more likely to render a liberal decision compared to a male jurist” (p. 273).  In a court location with 8 female judges it was estimated that a female judge is 20% more likely to make a decision favouring the accused than a male judge., Conclusion:  This study suggests that the impact of appointing judges with varying backgrounds and perspectives may depend on the representation of members of that group at the court location in which they work.  Gender differences between men and women judges who were all making individual decisions about criminal cases only became evident when there were more than a handful of other women judges working in the same building.   It may be that the impact of diversity of judicial appointments more generally (on racial, ethnic, or ideological dimensions) will only become evident as their numbers, in specific locations, exceed a critical number.  Token appointments, it would appear, will not be sufficient for diversity of backgrounds to make a difference., Reference: Collins, Paul M., Jr., Kenneth L.

Canadian police services use a wide variety of different wordings when cautioning those facing interrogation.  These cautions vary considerably in their verbal complexity and the ability of listeners to understand their meanings.,", Canadian police are required to tell those who are facing a police interrogation that they have the right to remain silent and they have the right to consult a lawyer.  Accused people can waive these rights if they have been informed that they have these rights and if they appreciate the consequences of waiving them.  However, there does not appear to be a standard warning that is given to accused people across the country.  Individual police departments (or provincial bodies) have developed their own warnings.  This paper examines warnings used by Canadian police services with a goal of understanding whether the variation in the wording of the warnings might be associated with variation in the ability of Canadians to understand and appreciate the meaning of these warnings., American research has demonstrated that the so-called Miranda warnings vary considerably in their length, readability, complexity, their use of unusual words, as well as the length and complexity of the sentences.  Using cautions collected from across Canada, the first step in this study was to examine the cautions for “readability.”  Perhaps the most frequently used technique for this is the “Flesch-Kincaid” score – an estimate of the (English language) reading level necessary to understand the warning.  It has been suggested that no higher than a Grade 6 reading level should be acceptable for these warnings (i.e., that a person who could read at the Grade 6 level or higher would be able to understand the warning)., Using this standard most of the right-to-silence cautions (15 of the 19) were found to be acceptable.  What is interesting, however, is the variability: it was estimated that someone with slightly higher than a Grade 5 level could understand the Halifax right-to-silence caution, whereas a person would need more than a Grade 8 education to understand the British Columbia caution.  There was similar variation on the right-to-legal counsel cautions.  It was estimated that a Grade 5 education was sufficient to understand the Charlottetown Police Department’s caution, whereas more than a Grade 8 education was needed to understand Calgary’s caution., A limited number of cautions concerning the right-to-legal counsel were compared by having these cautions read to undergraduate students in Canada.  Once again, the most important finding was that there was variability across cautions in how complete the students’ understanding was of the various warnings.  On some criteria, relatively few people understood the meaning of the warning; and on other criteria, there were large differences across different wordings., Conclusion: A caution given to a person who is being arrested or interrogated is only effective if its meaning is understood.   This paper suggests that some Canadian police services have been more successful than others at developing effective cautions.  More importantly, perhaps, this paper suggests that police services (or governments) could, if they were interested, develop and test the effectiveness of their warnings.  This process is straightforward, but not necessarily easy.  For example, the “model” warning created by the authors of the paper was not as effective, on some criteria, as warnings currently in use., Reference:  Eastwood, Joseph, Brent Snook, and Sarah J.

"Banishing people from certain areas of cities, without the need for a formal determination of wrongdoing, has become a new way of controlling those deemed to be disorderly.",", “Recently… social control strategies aimed primarily at spatial exclusion have enjoyed a surprising renaissance” (p. 2).   These strategies are enabled by legal tools that allow police and others to issue orders which exclude certain people from certain areas of cities.  Like ‘anti-social behaviour orders’ in England (see Criminological Highlights 10(5)#7) or a Chicago law making it an offence to remain in any one place without apparent purpose (Criminological Highlights 10(4)#3), the violation of these banishment orders may lead to serious consequences, even though there are no due process safeguards on the original placement of these orders or on their enforcement.  They appear to be based on two notions. First, these strategies seem to assume that if one can push or keep an ‘undesirable’ person out of an area, the problem will disappear.   Second, they seem to assume that there are no undesirable consequences of doing so., This study examines laws in Seattle, Washington, that, among other things, allow police officers to prohibit people from certain properties (e.g., parks) for up to a year if the police see someone using the facility “without legitimate purpose” (p. 7).  More familiar to criminologists are the orders not to enter certain areas that those on parole, probation, or pretrial release often have placed on them.  In some cities, for example, those under some form of criminal justice control are routinely ordered to stay out of areas in which drugs (or, depending on the case, prostitutes) can be found. In Seattle, designated “drug areas” constitute all of the downtown area and approximately half of the city’s land mass., One of the problems with these orders is their breadth. In Seattle, people banished from certain specific locations because they were found there ‘without legitimate purpose’ are banned from other specified commercial operations in that ‘zone.’  This can lead to peculiar results.  A resident banished from entering a McDonalds (perhaps because he overstayed his welcome in the McDonalds) can be automatically banished from a bank, a drug store, or mortuary down the street., Interviews with 41 residents who were subject to one or more banishment orders demonstrated that about two thirds of those subject to banishment orders often violated their orders.  The reasons were simple.  Compliance with the order would have meant almost complete social exclusion for those subject to the orders.  More generally, it would leave those with the least resources almost nowhere to go.  For many, compliance with banishment orders would have meant that they were excluded from various social services (including in some cases food and shelter) that they depended on. For others it meant that they could not (legally) work.  Non-compliance, however, had its costs: those subject to banishment orders were constantly avoiding being caught., Conclusion: Banishment orders are justified as methods of creating order.  But for the banished, “Being excluded was often a powerful emotional experience, one that confirmed their sense that they were no longer considered citizens, even fully human, by other residents of Seattle….  The use of [these orders] rendered the lives of some of Seattle’s most vulnerable residents more difficult and precarious.  The insistence that these exclusion orders are nonpunitive in nature is thus in marked tension with the experiences of the banished” (p. 34).  There was, on the other hand, no evidence that banishment had any positive impact on those subject to them or the community at large., Reference: Beckett, Katherine and Steve Herbert (2010).  Penal Boundaries: Banishment and the Expansion of Punishment.  Law & Social Inquiry, 35 (1), 1-38., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV11N3.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-11-no-3-%E2%80%93-july-2010,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 11, No. 3 – July 2010",Regular Issue,2010
"The willingness of members of the Muslim community in New York to work voluntarily with the police in combating terrorism is determined, in part, by how Muslims are treated by the police and others in the community.","As in some other countries since September 11, 2001, “Muslim American communities have become a focus for anti-terror policing efforts in the United States” (p. 366).  Hence it is not surprising that there is interest in “what circumstances are associated with voluntary cooperation by Muslim Americans in anti-terror policing efforts and in particular, which policing strategies enhance or diminish that cooperation” (p. 366). This study addresses this issue with data from a 2009 survey of 300 randomly selected Muslim Americans living in the New York City area., The study focuses in large part on issues surrounding procedural justice.  Research on procedural justice suggests that people are more likely to comply with the police and cooperate with them when they believe that the police authorities are acting in a legitimate and fair manner.  Previous research (Criminological Highlights, 4(4)#1, 7(1)#4) has demonstrated that the more police and other justice authorities are viewed as legitimate, the more likely it is that their rules and decisions are accepted., Muslim Americans’ views of police legitimacy in fighting terrorism were assessed by the level of agreement with statements such as “You should trust these law enforcement agents to make decisions that are good for everyone when they are investigating and prosecuting terrorism” (p. 390).  Police legitimacy in fighting terrorism was greatest for those respondents who saw the police as acting in a procedurally fair manner (e.g., making decisions based on facts rather than opinions, applying the law consistently, giving people a chance to express their views before making decisions). Police legitimacy was, however, also related to the extent to which respondents identified with being American and expressed support for U.S. policies in fighting terrorism., Those respondents who indicated that they thought that the police acted in a procedurally fair manner within their (Muslim) communities were more likely to indicate their willingness to alert the police to possible terrorism threats. In addition, those respondents who believed that anti-terrorism policies had been created in a legitimate fashion (e.g., that the community had been given an opportunity to provide input and community views were considered) were more likely to cooperate with the police in averting terrorism and they were more willing to alert the police to possible terrorism activities.   Those Muslim Americans who reported experiencing discrimination at school, work, or in dealing with authorities, were less likely to be willing to cooperate with the police or report possible terrorism activities to the police. Finally, those respondents who had strong identification with America (e.g., who agreed with the statement that “Being an American is important to the way I think of myself as a person”) were more likely to be willing to alert the police., Conclusion: Most New York Muslim respondents indicated that they would engage in cooperative actions if asked to do so by the police, and most indicated that they would report possible terrorist related activities to the police.  The variation that did exist in Muslims’ willingness to combat terrorism appears to be in large part affected by the degree to which Muslims have had positive versus discriminatory interactions with others in American society. Those who felt excluded from American society through overt discrimination, for example, as well as those who reported that the police did not treat them fairly were less likely to be cooperative on terrorism matters.   If the cooperation of the western Muslim communities is important, therefore, it appears that western societies have the opportunity to increase that cooperation in large part by examining and addressing aspects of their own treatment of Muslims in their communities., Reference: Tyler, Tom R., Stephen Schulhofer, and Aziz Z.

Punitive judges don’t stop crime.,", A fair amount of published research suggests that harsher sentences do not reduce recidivism and may even increase the likelihood of future offending (Criminological Highlights, 11(1)#1, 11(1)#2).  A weakness of many studies of the impact of imprisonment on subsequent offending is that it cannot be assumed that judges hand down sentences at random.  Hence there remains the possibility that pre-existing differences between those offenders treated harshly and those treated more leniently may account for differences (or lack of differences) in their recidivism rates.  In order to overcome this problem, this study takes advantage of one common fact, and one unusual procedure: judges vary in their punitiveness and, in Washington, D.C., judges have cases assigned to them in an essentially random fashion. In other words, it might be said that Washington, D.C. offenders are randomly assigned to be sentenced by judges who give sentences of quite different levels of severity., This study looked at the impact of variation in sentence severity on recidivism in cases of drug felonies (largely distribution and possession for the purpose of distribution) in 2002/3.  Cases were assigned to nine different judges in a sequential fashion. Though there were occasional departures from this procedure because a court was overloaded with cases, neither the facts of the case nor the defendant ever determined the court assignment. Indeed, a careful examination of the cases found that judges had very similar distributions of cases on 20 different dimensions.  Most (85%) of the defendants had at least one prior arrest and most (67%) had at least one prior conviction., There were nine court dockets (or judges).  The proportion of these drug offenders who were incarcerated varied, across judges, from a low of 23% incarcerated to a high of 65%.  These differences far exceeded what could be expected by chance.  Said differently, the judge (as opposed to the characteristics of the case) was a major determinant of sentence severity.  The average non-suspended prison sentence varied from 5.1 months for the least punitive judge to 11.9 months for the most punitive.  The proportion given probation, instead of or in addition to prison, varied from 29% to 60%. Clearly there was considerable variation across judges. The measure of recidivism was whether the offender was rearrested on any criminal charge in Washington, D.C., or the neighbouring state of Maryland within 4 years of the date on which the case was completed.  Since those incarcerated had less opportunity to offend, this operationalization would tend to reduce the apparent re-offending rate of those incarcerated or those incarcerated for the longest period of time (i.e., it would tend to create effects that would support the idea that individuals are deterred by harsher sentences)., There was no evidence that those sentenced by harsh judges (i.e., those who incarcerated higher proportions of offenders; or those judges who, on average, incarcerated offenders for long periods of time) were less likely to recidivate.  Similarly, the number of months of probation was unrelated to reoffending.  If anything, those who received sentences from harsh judges (i.e., those prone to handing out prison sentences) were more likely to recidivate (even though they might have had less time to do so) though this effect was not consistently statistically significant across analyses., Conclusion: Whether one controls, statistically, for characteristics of the 1003 cases in the study, or simply compares the outcome of cases randomly assigned to be sentenced by ‘tough’ vs. ‘lenient’ judges, the findings are consistent. The most conservative conclusion would be that “Incarceration seems to have little effect on the likelihood of rearrest.  Despite the fact that [the study] measured recidivism in a way that gives those incapacitated by prison time less time to recidivate than those who are not incarcerated, prison time seems to do little to reduce the odds of rearrest.  Evidently, the combined effects of incapacitation and specific deterrence are weak in this setting” (p. 381).  “Those assigned by chance to receive prison time and their counterparts who received no prison time were rearrested at similar rates over a 4-year time frame” (p. 382)., Reference: Green, Donald P. and Daniel Winik (2010).

"Formal processing of youths in the youth justice system does not reduce subsequent offending.  If anything, youths processed formally are more likely to re-offend than those screened out of the formal system or processed informally.",", Those making decisions about how to process young offenders often have choices on how to respond to these offenders – especially when youths have committed relatively minor offences.  In Canada, police are required to consider measures other than court-based procedures and it is presumed that it is better for many young offenders to be dealt with outside of the formal justice system.  To some extent, Canada’s 2003 youth justice law has been successful in reducing the use of youth court (see Criminological Highlights 10(1)#1, 10(3)#1)., This paper reviews research on the impact of youth court processing on subsequent offending, comparing it to a non-youth-justice-system response to offending.  It is limited to ‘random assignment’ studies in order to ensure that any findings cannot be attributed to pre-existing differences between the two groups of youths., In all, 29 separate sets of findings, involving 7,304 youths, in studies published between 1973 and 2008 were located that met this very strict (random assignment) criterion. In each study, youths were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: normal court processing or some form of less formal processing. Across studies, the ‘less formal processing’ varied somewhat.  What was important, however, was that by assigning the youths to treatment on a random basis, the two groups (‘court processing’ and ‘no formal processing’ ) can be considered to be equivalent. The authors looked at the longest follow-up period reported in each study (when more than one was reported). These follow-up periods were, on average about 12-13 months long (range 4 to 36 months)., Overall, court processing appeared to increase the likelihood that youths would be involved in at least some subsequent offending, though there were non-trivial differences across studies. For those 7 experiments that reported the total number of offences that the youth were involved in (instead of or in addition to simply whether the youth committed a subsequent offence), court processing also had a criminogenic effect.  Youths processed by the courts were, on average, involved in more crime than those processed in other ways. Similar effects were found for severity: formal court processing of youths, if anything, increased the severity of subsequent offending., These criminogenic effects are, however, very small.  The studies were broken down in various ways (e.g., those carried out early in the period vs. later, whether the comparison involved the provision of services or the youth was not offered any services if diverted, etc.).  None of the sub-sets of studies showed a significant crime-reducing impact of court processing., Conclusion: A conservative conclusion would be that court processing does not reduce subsequent offending. “Given that the evidence indicates that there is no public safety benefit to [youth justice] system processing, and its greater costs when compared to release, even the most conservative cost-benefit analyses would favour release over [youth justice] system processing” (p. 38).  Obviously some youths, because they have committed serious offences, will be brought to court in any jurisdiction and one cannot generalize the findings from these studies to those youth because these studies focused largely on youths charged with relatively minor offences.  At the same time it should be noted that  “the data from these studies do not support a policy of establishing [formal] diversion programs for juveniles who normally would not have been officially processed….” (p. 39)., Reference: Petrosino, Anthony, Carolyn Turpin-Petrosino, and Sarah Guckenburg (2010).

Incarcerating young adults who could be punished in the community ensures that they will be less likely to be in the workforce upon release.,", Being imprisoned for the first time appears to increase the likelihood of future offending (Criminological Highlights 11(1)#2).  In addition, the mention of a criminal record by people applying for an entry level job (Criminological Highlights 6(3)#2) reduces considerably their chances of being offered that job.   This paper compares the employment prospects of two groups of offenders: those sent to prison and a comparable group who were convicted but not incarcerated., The challenge in research of this kind is to estimate the impact of imprisonment on employment above and beyond the pre-existing differences between those imprisoned and those not imprisoned. In other words, those who are sent to prison often have employment deficits such as low education or few job skills.  This study used a subset of respondents from the (U.S.) National Longitudinal Survey of Youth – those youths who had not been convicted by the time of their first interview (age 13-17) but who were convicted prior to one of the subsequent interviews.   As it turns out, the ‘to-be-incarcerated’ youths who are convicted do differ, as a group, from the ‘convicted-but-not-incarcerated’ youths.  Hence a ‘matching’ strategy (based on over 30 variables such as family structure, educational background, various risk factors, arrest history, and offence of conviction) was used in this study., Various outcome measures were examined reflecting the possibility that one of the impacts of imprisonment could be to discourage young people from looking for employment.  Thus the researchers examined whether the offender was employed, unemployed (in the work force but not employed) or not in the work force at all., First time incarceration, controlling for pre-conviction differences, reduces the likelihood of formal employment by about 11% compared to those convicted but not incarcerated.  The employment deficit is consistent over time (after conviction). “The higher presence of nonemployment [by those incarcerated] stems almost exclusively from labour force nonparticipation rather than unemployment” (p. 465). In other words, it is not so much that those sent to prison can’t find jobs; they simply aren’t looking for work (perhaps because they believe – correctly or not – that they will not get jobs).    For those who obtain employment, there was no difference between the non-incarcerated and those incarcerated in the number of weeks per year that they actually worked., Looking at employment over time, most of those convicted (whether sent to prison or not) experienced unstable employment.  However, incarcerated youths are less likely to be in stable employment, more likely to be consistently out of the work force, and more likely not employed but only occasionally looking for work.., Conclusion:  The youths in this study were, on average, only in prison (on this first occasion) for a little more than 4 months.  Nevertheless, this relatively short period of incarceration appears to have had a long-lasting impact on their employment patterns. By their own accounts, it was not so much that ex-inmates were not finding work, it is that they were not looking for work. Since all of those in this study had been convicted, it is clear that there is an additional long-term deficit created by incarceration, in addition to any impact of the conviction itself.  More specifically, the challenge seems to be to identify ways of attaching ex-inmates to the labour market. “To the degree that… incarceration [of youths] disrupts the process of attachment to work, it has the capacity to serve as a catalyst that sustains long-term criminal involvement” (p. 471)., Reference:  Apel, Robert and Gary Sweeten (2010).  The Impact of Incarceration on Employment during the Transition to Adulthood.

"In general, youths who spend a lot of unsupervised time with other youths are more likely than youths whose leisure time is supervised by adults to be involved in violence.  However, the impact of unsupervised time on involvement in violent crime does not hold for youths who live in close-knit neighbourhoods in which people help and get along with one another.",", A good deal of research has shown that “unstructured socializing with peers [is] associated with general delinquency, substance abuse, and alcohol use” (p. 446).  Other research (e.g., Criminological Highlights 1(2)#2) has shown that neighbourhoods in which people trust one another and where one can expect neighbours to act for the common good (i.e., neighbourhoods high in what is termed ‘collective efficacy’) tend to have less crime than would be expected on the basis of the characteristics of the residents themselves.  This paper looks at the impact of unstructured socializing in neighbourhoods that differ in levels of collective efficacy, the hypothesis being that in neighbourhoods high in collective efficacy (where, among other things, the residents of the neighbourhood appear to have a stake in keeping the neighbourhood safe), unstructured socializing will be unrelated to involvement in violence., Eighty relatively small neighbourhoods in Chicago were assessed for collective efficacy using residents’ agreement or disagreement with questions such as “People around here are willing to help their neighbours” or “Parents in this neighbourhood generally know each other.”, A separate (but related) longitudinal survey of youths obtained data on unstructured socializing using such questions as “How often do you hang out with friends”.  A measure of violent offending was constructed from questions such as “During the last 12 months have you hit someone with whom you do not live?... carried a hidden weapon?…. been in a gang fight?” (p. 453).  Each youth’s involvement with deviant peers was assessed using questions such as “How many of the people you spend time with have gotten involved in behaviours such as damaging property, attacking someone with a weapon and using drugs” (p. 454). The youths were interviewed for the first time when they were 8-13 years old and were interviewed for the third time when they were 12-19 years old., The study found that youths who had a larger number of ‘deviant peers’ at their second interview were more likely to come from a family whose parents were not married.   Similarly, the authors found some consistency over time. Those youths who reported being involved in violence at their second interview were more likely to report involvement in violence at their third interview.  Being involved in large amounts of unstructured socializing was also associated with self-reported violent behaviour. However, the most interesting finding came from an analysis that controlled for involvement with deviant peers, parental supervision, family structure, etc., and looked how unstructured socializing and the type of neighbourhood had an impact on self-reported violent behaviour in the third interview.  Unstructured socializing was only associated with increased violence in “low collective efficacy” neighbourhoods.  In neighbourhoods that were cohesive and people looked after one another, unstructured socializing was not associated with violence., Conclusion. Youths are more likely to engage in unstructured socializing with peers in neighbourhoods high in collective efficacy (neighbourhoods in which people look after one another). Parents may be more likely to allow unstructured socializing in neighbourhoods considered to be well-monitored and in which the neighbours are thought of as being trustworthy.  It would appear that, at least in terms of violence, parents are making intelligent decisions: unstructured socializing is unrelated to violence in high collective efficacy neighbourhoods.  Involvement in violence, then, is not simply a function of the characteristics of the youth or the characteristics of the youth’s friends.  The neighbourhood in which youths find themselves can, in effect, eliminate the violence-enhancing risk involved with having friends who are involved in crime.  From this perspective, policies that support neighbourhoods may serve to reduce violence., Reference: Maimon, David and Christopher R.

The imposition of fines and other financial obligations on offenders can have unintended negative effects on offenders and can even contribute to crime.,", Monetary sanctions, or ‘legal financial obligations’ (fines, restitution or compensation orders, victim surcharges, charges related to prosecution and corrections, etc.), are often imposed on those found guilty of criminal offences.  In Washington state, for example, there are 19 different monetary fees that can be imposed on those convicted of felonies. Moreover, in some parts of the U.S., corrections departments as well as organizations involved in the supervision of those on probation can also impose fees on offenders., The difficulty with legal financial obligations that are imposed on offenders is that even small monetary sanctions can be very difficult for many offenders to meet. In the state of Washington, for example, in addition to fines, certain legal financial obligations can be imposed on those accused of crimes even if they are not found guilty. A fee is also imposed when an accused opts for trial by jury. In all cases in which a person is convicted of a felony, a $500 “victim penalty assessment” is required.  Costs of imprisonment or pretrial detention can also be imposed on those convicted of offences., Surveys of those in American state prisons show that many inmates have court-imposed monetary obligations that they will be expected to meet upon release, if not earlier. The prevalence of these financial obligations varies considerably across states, but in many states (e.g., California, Minnesota, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Vermont) at least 75% of prison inmates have these obligations.  The proportion of those convicted, and of inmates in prison, with legal financial obligations has increased in the U.S. since 1990., In this study, 50 convicted felons living in the community were interviewed about the legal financial obligations relating to their most recent conviction.  Not surprisingly, most of those interviewed were not employed, and about a quarter had inadequate or no housing. More than half were expected to support children.  Those interviewed noted that legal financial obligations often meant that they didn’t have money for shelter or food or that they had to choose between paying their legal financial obligations or other necessities.  For some, the payback amounts and interest were such that they would be paying for more than 10 years.  For others, because they were not able to pay, it meant that they lost other privileges (e.g., their drivers’ licenses) and, as a result were unable to work.  For still others, being on welfare suspended the requirement of paying back their legal financial obligations. If, however, the person were to get a job, payback would then be required.  The net effect was that the convicted felon was better off financially if he were to stay on welfare since the net income on welfare was higher than the employment income after legal financial obligations were deducted., Non-payment had its own consequences: respondents indicated that when they could not pay, they sometimes would move or hide in order to avoid re-arrest for non-payment. Ironically, some of those who were re-arrested found that their financial debt increased because they had to pay jail costs.  The consequence of non-payment was that payments were increased in size., Conclusion: Across the U.S. about two-thirds of felons sentenced to prison and more than 80% of all other offenders had monetary sanctions imposed on them in 2004. The debt that they are left with is substantial in comparison with their income. “Legal debt contributes to the accumulation of disadvantage” by reducing already low incomes, creating long term debt which reduces access to housing and employment. It creates disincentives to work and in some cases encourages those with employment to quit their jobs to avoid being arrested if they cannot afford court-imposed payment.  Simply put, “the widespread imposition of substantial legal debt may encourage antisocial rather than prosocial outcomes” (p. 1792)., Reference: Harris, Alexes, Heather Evans and Katherine Beckett (2010).

Conditions that are placed on sex offenders prohibiting them from living near schools and daycares do not contribute to public safety.,", Governments like simple intuitive solutions to problems even if there is no evidence that they are effective.  The manner in which many countries deal with sex offenders provides an obvious example of this problem. Registration and public notification of the whereabouts of sex offenders clearly have negative effects (see Criminological Highlights 7(4)#4, 8(6)#5, 9(2)#7), are ineffective (see Criminological Highlights 4(1)#2, 5(6)#1, 10(3)#7), and, in any case, are typically based on the false assumption that a sex offender has an atypically high likelihood of reoffending (See Criminological Highlights 3(3)#3, 5(1)#4, 6(3)#3, 6(6)#8) 8(3)#8, 9(2)#5).   This paper examines the impact of laws that prohibit those convicted of sex offences from living near schools and daycares., The theory behind residence restrictions on sex offenders is a simple one:  it is assumed that the more children who are locally available as victims, the higher the likelihood that a former sex offender will re-offend.  The theory implies that if a sex offender lives physically distant from large groups of children, he will be less likely to offend than if he were to live near institutions with large groups of children (e.g., daycare centres or schools). This assumption, of course, ignores the fact that most victims of sex offenders are known to the offender before the offence takes place (See Criminological Highlights 4(1)#2).  It also assumes that sex offenders are likely to offend against strangers who live near the sex offender’s home., To test the hypothesis that sex offenders who live close to schools or daycares are more likely to re-offend, this study first identified 165 registered sex offenders living in the community in Florida who were arrested for a subsequent sex offence in 2004-2006. Each of these sex offenders had apparently committed at least one offence against a young person.  From state records, a comparable group of sex offenders who did not reoffend during this period was located.  These two groups were almost identical on whether or not they had committed a ‘predator’ sex offence in the past (about 23% of the sample), the number of previous sex offences, total prior convictions of any kind, race, age and marital status., Using a list of all schools (public and private) and licensed daycares in the state, the researchers then examined for each person in each of these two groups (those re-arrested or not re-arrested for a sex offence) the number of  schools and daycares within 1000 feet (305m) and 2500 feet (762m) of the sex offender’s residence.  An equal number of recidivists and non-recidivists (about 30%) lived within 1000 feet of a daycare.  About a quarter of recidivists and non-recidivists lived within 1000 feet of a school.  Recidivists were, contrary to the ‘proximity’ hypothesis, slightly less likely than non-recidivists to have at least one school within 2500 feet (762m) of their residence., Conclusion: “Living close to a school or daycare does not appear to increase access to children in a way that facilitates recidivism for known sex offenders” (p. 499).  Hence it would appear that such restrictions do not accomplish the goal for which they are designed.  However, “residence restriction zones create barriers to re-entry and inhibit the factors known to contribute to successful reintegration, such as employment, housing stability, prosocial relationships and civic engagement” (p. 499)., Reference: Zandbergen, Paul A., Jill S.

"For low risk offenders, anything more than very occasional meetings with probation and parole officers is a waste of resources.",", Those supervising offenders in the community often feel that they don’t have enough time to supervise their caseload in a proper fashion.  One method of freeing up resources is to search for groups of offenders who do not benefit from supervision.  In many jurisdictions, many of the offenders being supervised in the community would be described as low risk offenders., This study, carried out in Philadelphia, identified people on probation or parole who were predicted, on the basis of their criminal record and other basic data, not to commit any serious offences within two years of being in the community.   These low risk offenders were assigned at random to probation officers who, as a result of participation in this experiment, were supervising an average of 135 cases per officer (the normal caseload) or an average of 323 cases per officer.  The result of this assignment, not surprisingly, was that there were about half as many in-person or other contacts (2.4 in a year) for the ‘low intensity’ group (those supervised by probation officers with large caseloads) as in the ‘normal intensity’ group (4.5 contacts).  Total contacts (telephone, in-person, etc.) of any kind averaged about 10 per year for the ‘normal’ caseload group and 5.5 for the low intensity group., Recidivism was assessed from city court records.  Though obviously some might have offended outside city limits, there is no reason to believe that the rate of offending outside of the city would vary between the two groups since the offenders were randomly assigned to ‘normal’ or ‘low intensity’ supervision., Eight different measures of recidivism within one year of assignment to one of the two conditions were examined:  any new charges, any charges involving serious offences, any violent offences, any sexual offences, any property offences, any firearm offences, any drug offences, and any new jail incarceration., The two groups did not differ on whether or not the offender recidivated nor did they differ on the frequency of recidivating for any of these different measures.   Given the sample size of the experiment (1559 offenders assigned at random to one of the two groups), the experiment would have identified an effect if there had been even a small effect of supervision intensity., Conclusion:  The results of this experiment suggest that for low risk offenders, there is no criminological benefit from relatively higher rates of supervision.  The experiment “constitutes strong evidence that [probation and parole] agencies with low frequency of [in person] visits (i.e., 4.5 visits annually)  [of probation/ parole clients with the supervisor] can safely cut that frequency roughly in half (to 2.4 visits annually) at least for low risk offenders…” (p. 184).   More generally, the study provides a justification for other probation/ parole agencies to experiment with the allocation of resources to low risk clients., Reference: Barnes, Geoffrey C., Linsay Ahlman, Carlotte Gill, Lawrence W.

"Incarcerating offenders who could be given non-custodial sanctions does not reduce the likelihood that they will commit further offences.  In fact, incarceration may increase the probability of recidivism.","Evidence does not support the conclusion that increasing the severity of sentences – e.g., by imposing incarceration rather than a non-custodial sentence – increases the general deterrent impact of the criminal law (e.g., Criminological Highlights, V6N2#1). But in addition, incarceration is often justified by assertions that it reduces crime by incapacitating or deterring imprisoned offenders.  This paper looks at the possibility that the latter mechanism – deterrence through imprisonment – might be effective.  Though the rate at which offenders are imprisoned varies dramatically across countries, imprisonment is, almost certainly, the most expensive sanction in any country. Hence if imprisonment is being employed for utilitarian purposes, it is important to know if there is a crime-reducing effect.  On the other hand, if, as some suggest, imprisonment increases the likelihood of recidivism, then policies that increase imprisonment may not only be expensive, they may lead to increased crime and even higher rates of imprisonment., There are theoretical reasons to expect that imprisonment will decrease crime just as there are reasons to expect that it will increase crime. The theory of specific deterrence is grounded in the idea that a chastening effect, derived from the experience of imprisonment, will deter reoffending. The structure of sentencing law as it addresses recidivists may also cause previously convicted individuals to revise upward their estimates of the likelihood and/or severity of punishment for future lawbreaking. This could occur because the criminal law commonly prescribes more severe penalties for recidivists. On the other hand, being in prison may increase crime by making crime seem more acceptable, decreasing the stigma of offending, creating opportunities for people to associate with others who are likely to offend, or by decreasing legitimate opportunities for offenders., One of the most difficult challenges in estimating the impact of any sanction (especially imprisonment) on offenders is that comparisons of those who did and did not receive the sanction are needed. Given that imprisonment is rarely imposed on a truly random basis, care must be taken to ensure that studies have appropriate comparison groups. This is especially important because offenders over about age 18 are likely, over time, to decrease their involvement in crime., This paper looks at a range of high quality studies on the effect of imprisonment., Conclusion: “The great majority of [competently carried out] studies point to a null or criminogenic effect of the prison experience on subsequent offending. This… should, at least, caution against wild claims – at times found in ‘get tough’ rhetoric voiced in recent decades – that prisons have special powers to scare offenders straight” (p. 178).  Hence, the continued use of prisons for the simple purpose of reducing re-offending cannot be justified by the considerable amount of evidence that currently exists., Reference: Nagin,  Daniel S., Francis T. Cullen, and Cheryl Lero Jonson (2009). Imprisonment and Reoffending. In Crime and Justice: A Review of Research (Tonry, Michael, ed.), Volume 38.

First-time imprisonment of offenders increases the likelihood that they will re-offend.,", It has been demonstrated (e.g., Criminological Highlights V11N1#1) that placing offenders in prison either has no impact or a criminogenic (crime increasing) impact on them.  However, the effect on those sent to prison for the first time may be very different.  “Imprisonment may exert more of an influence on those with criminal histories that are relatively short and involve relatively few offenses than for individuals with a prior criminal trajectory that starts early and involves many convictions” (p. 228)., Because offending rates are so age-dependent, this study compares the “post-release re-conviction rate of imprisoned individuals and matched controls who were not imprisoned over identical ages” (p. 228).  The sample of cases that were examined started with a group of male offenders tried in the Netherlands in 1977. All convictions prior to that date and up until 2002 were recorded.  The study focused on offenders who were imprisoned for the first time between age 18 and age 38. It then examined their offending in the three years after release from prison.  The length of imprisonment (for those in the sample who were imprisoned) varied in length from 1 day to 1 year, with about 80% imprisoned for 6 months or less., In order to match those who were incarcerated with those who were not, offenders were grouped according to their offending trajectories. “The method is designed to identify groups of individuals following approximately the same developmental trajectory over a specified period of time for the outcome of interest (criminal convictions)” (p. 236). Hence, “regardless of prison status at a certain age, individuals in the same trajectory group up to that age appear to be headed along the same path, at least so far as criminal offending is concerned” (p. 236). In all, 21 separate group-based trajectory models were estimated.  The purpose was to provide a baseline set of expectations of the conviction histories of individuals who had not been imprisoned over the period of the trajectory., In addition, a ‘propensity score’, estimating for each individual the likelihood of future offending, was created on the basis of offence characteristics, criminal history, and various measures of the offender’s life circumstances. Then individuals who were first imprisoned at a given age were matched with up to 3 individuals who were not imprisoned at that same age.  The propensity scores of these matched individuals had to be the same or very close. Obviously some people were unable to be matched: those relatively high rate offenders who committed relatively serious offences were almost invariably sent to prison. Matches for them could not be found. By dropping these offenders from the study, the confidence in the study is increased since it demonstrates that the study only compared offenders for whom similar offenders (imprisoned and non-imprisoned) could be found., The results are easy to describe: For all crimes (combined) and for three different types of crimes separately (property, violent, and all other) the experience of first-time imprisonment increased the likelihood of reconviction within a three year period. There was, in addition, some evidence that the crime-generating impact of imprisonment was larger for those imprisoned at younger ages., Conclusion: On balance, then, the criminogenic effects of first time imprisonment are fairly consistent across offence types and age.  Though not all of the criminogenic effects of first time imprisonment were significant, there were no crime reducing effects of imprisonment that were significant, and only 9 of 64 comparisons between those imprisoned and not were in the direction of suggesting a crime reduction effect.  It could be argued, therefore, that judges who send offenders to prison for the first time in circumstances in which alternatives to imprisonment are plausible are likely to be contributing to an increased crime rate., Reference: Nieuwbeerta, Paul, Daniel S. Nagin, and Arjan A. J. Blokland (2009). Assessing the Impact of First-Time Imprisonment on Offenders’ Subsequent Criminal Career Development: A Matched Sample Comparison.

Numerous studies have shown that mandatory penalties do not affect crime rates. The evidence is equally consistent in showing that they interfere with accountability and the efficient operation of the criminal justice system.,", “Experienced practitioners, policy analysts, and researchers have long agreed that mandatory penalties in all their forms… are a bad idea” (p. 65).  That “is why nearly every authoritative nonpartisan law reform organization that has considered the subject… [has] opposed enactment, and favoured repeal of mandatory penalties” (p. 66).  Three justifications are offered for mandatory penalties: evenhandedness, transparency, and the prevention of crime.  None withstands careful scrutiny., There is substantial evidence demonstrating that when mandatory penalties are seen as being too severe, prosecutors and judges will often (but not always) circumvent them, in effect moving sentencing decisions from the open courtroom to dark hallways and private offices. This ensures that the penalties handed down are neither consistent across similar cases nor transparent to anyone., That mandatory sentencing laws are often nullified when their application would be unfairly harsh has been known for at least 3 centuries.  The proliferation of mandatory death sentences in 18th century England led to the development of judicial technicalities meant to prevent their application and to widespread refusal by juries to convict offenders of crimes punishable by death. A wide variety of modern techniques (e.g., the prosecution’s “swallowing the gun” or alleging lesser quantities of drugs than were really involved or changing of charges) are today commonly used to circumvent mandatory penalties., Mandatory penalties have repeatedly been shown to increase the number of trials (since the consequences of guilty pleas to the original charge are often disproportionately harsh and no benefit can be given for a guilty plea). In many instances, probabilities of conviction decreased when mandatory penalties are implemented and return to normal only when new charge and plea bargaining conventions have evolved.  Prosecutors sometimes use the threat of overly harsh mandatory penalties to induce risk-avoidance guilty pleas to lesser charges.  For example, Oregon’s dramatic mandatory minimum law (enacted by referendum in 1994) shifted pleas from charges carrying the new mandatories to other lesser included charges (see Criminological Highlights, V5N4#5)., A frequently cited justification for enactment of mandatory penalties is their presumed deterrent impact.  Repeatedly, however, it has been shown that the imposition of mandatory penalties is not associated with reduced crime (e.g., Criminological Highlights V6N2#1, V7N3#6). Of fifteen recent studies summarized in this paper, only one shows any deterrent effects, and it uses a methodology that does not to take into account what is known about crime and the processing of criminal cases., Conclusion: “Mandatory penalties often result in injustice to individual offenders.  They undermine the legitimacy of the courts and the prosecution process by fostering circumventions that are wilful and subterranean. They undermine… equality before the law when they cause comparably culpable offenders to be treated radically differently” (p. 100).  And 40 years of increasingly sophisticated research shows they do not have deterrent effects. Getting rid of mandatory penalties however, is not straightforward.  One approach is to follow the lead of some jurisdictions: change mandatory penalties into presumptive penalties. Alternatively, “sunset” clauses could be enacted that would abolish the mandatory nature of the law unless the legislature were to re-enact them., Reference:  Tonry, Michael (2009).  The Mostly Unintended Effects of Mandatory Penalties: Two Centuries of Consistent Findings.

Violent crime rates decrease when immigrants move into a city. This occurs in part because immigrants are more likely to bolster intact (two-parent) family structures.,", A substantial amount of recent research would suggest that – contrary to popular perceptions – immigrants are, if anything, less likely to be involved in crime than their native born counterparts (e.g., Criminological Highlights, V10N6#7, V8N3#5).  What may be important about the relationship of immigration to crime is that “there are good reasons to suspect that immigration affects demographic, economic,  and social structures in ways that will impact overall crime rates [above and beyond] any differences in the individual-level offending of immigrants and [those born in the country]” (p. 448)., This study looks at the relationship between changes in the number of immigrants in 159 U.S. cities between 1980 and 2000 and rates of violent crime.  More importantly, it attempts to understand why immigration rates might have a relationship to rates of violent crime by systematically investigating changes in the cities that relate to changes in the concentration of immigrants., Violent crime was estimated by using rates of homicides, robberies, aggravated assaults, and rapes for each city at three points in time: the first three years of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s.  Immigration was estimated using three highly correlated measures: the percent of the population who had immigrated in the previous 10 years, the percent who did not know English or reported speaking it “not well,” and the percent Latino., The analyses examined whether within-city changes over time in immigration affect within-city changes over time in violence.  Without controlling for any other factors, there was a relationship:  large increases in immigration in a city were related to decreases in violent crime.  When various other predictors of violent crime – e.g., percent young males, city size, residential instability, poverty rates, drug market arrests – were statistically controlled for, there was essentially no change in the relationship between immigration and crime., A measure of family instability – a combination of the percent of the adult population that is divorced and the percent of family households not headed by married couples – did relate to the violent crime rate: cities with high levels of family instability tended to have higher violent crime rates.  More importantly in the context of immigration, family stability or family structure “is an important mediator of the effect of immigration on the violent crime rate” (p. 463).  When family instability was controlled for, the size of the negative relationship between immigration rates and crime was cut in half.  These results are “consistent with the hypothesis that increases in the immigrant population led to less violent crime in large part by altering family structure.  More specifically, immigration appears to have a dampening influence on family instability, which in turn, lowers violent crime rates” (p. 463-4)., Conclusion:  These findings – immigration leading to lower violent crime rates in large part because immigration is associated with more intact families – suggest that immigration “may have beneficial impacts on important social institutions” (p. 466).  Whether these effects of immigration will be maintained across generations is, of course, a separate issue., Reference: Ousey, Graham C. and Charis E.

Highly concentrated public housing neighbourhoods in the U.S. have high homicide rates. These homicides typically involve victims and offenders from the same neighbourhood in which the crime takes place.  Those who live in public housing are less likely to commit homicides outside of their neighbourhoods than are people from other neighbourhoods.,", High rates of crime in concentrated public housing developments are the result not simply of characteristics of those who live there, but of the built environment itself.  In the United States, “Rates of violent crime in public housing are higher than in other disadvantaged, non-public housing neighbourhoods… (p.476). It is suggested that public housing developments may “inhibit social control… and [create] a social environment that limits social interactions between residents and the broader society” (p. 475)., This paper examines homicides that occurred in the Southeast Policing Area of Los Angeles, California between 1980 and 2000. This is a chronically disadvantaged area on almost all social and economic measures.  The study looks at the location of the residence of the victim and offender as well as the location of the homicide incident.  The hypothesis was that “if public housing is socially isolated…. internal homicides [where victim and offender live in the same neighbourhood in which the homicide takes place] should be significantly more common among homicides that occur in public housing developments relative to those occurring  in other neighbourhoods” (p. 479)., The average homicide rate during the period of study in the public housing neighbourhood was 131 per 100,000 residents compared to 69 in the rest of the policing area. (The U.S. rate during this period varied between 5.5 and 10.2; Canada’s varied between 1.8 and 2.7.)  The challenge faced by the study was not only to see if certain ‘types’ of homicides are more likely to occur in public housing neighbourhoods, but to see if this concentration held after characteristics of the victim and offender (e.g., race, age) and ‘event type’ (e.g., gang or drug motive, relationship of victim to offender) were held constant.  In addition to internal homicides, homicides were classified as being predatory (victim lives in homicide location, offender does not), intrusion (offender lives in homicide location but victim lives elsewhere), offence mobility (offender and victim live in same neighbourhood, but incident happens elsewhere), and total mobility (victim and offender live in different neighbourhoods, and incident occurs in 3rd neighbourhood)., Overall, “Victims and offenders who live in public housing… are overwhelmingly involved in homicides within their developments” (p. 485).  Only 23% of the victims who were known to live in public housing were killed outside of their own development. In contrast, 56% of non-public housing victims were killed outside of their home neighbourhoods. More importantly, taking into account various characteristics of the victim, offender, and the nature of the homicide, homicides that take place in public housing are more likely than non-public housing homicides to involve resident offenders and resident victims. In addition, homicides committed by residents of public housing are more likely than homicides committed by residents of non-public housing to take place in their own neighbourhoods., Conclusion: Homicides involving public housing residents (as victims or offenders) overwhelmingly take place within the neighbourhood of the victim and offender. Neighbourhoods adjoining public housing, therefore, do not appear to be disproportionately at risk from proximity to public housing.  The challenge raised by these findings is to implement changes in public housing neighbourhoods that address the isolation of these residents and protect residents from victimization., Reference: Griffiths, Elizabeth and George Tita (2009).

The size of Canada’s remand population is increasing rapidly even though reported crime is decreasing and the overall imprisonment rate is relatively stable.,", Canada’s overall imprisonment rate has been relatively stable for more than 50 years (Criminological Highlights, V8N2#6) varying between about 82 and 116 per hundred thousand residents.  However, the remand rate (counts of prisoners on an average day which is included within the overall imprisonment rate) has risen steadily in the past 20 years from 15 per hundred thousand residents in 1987 to 39 in 2007. In 1987 remand prisoners represented 15% of Canada’s total prison population.  By 2007, 35% of all Canada’s adult prisoners had not yet been sentenced.  These figures, however, obscure one other paradox: although criminal law is a federal responsibility, there are huge differences across provinces in the remand prisoner rate. For example, in Manitoba in 2007 there were about 90 remand prisoners per 100,000 residents. In Prince Edward Island there were 12 remand prisoners per 100,000 residents., Canada’s remand population has been increasing in recent years at the same time that overall reported crime and violent crime have both been decreasing. It appears – at least for the one province for which data are available (Ontario, Canada’s largest province) – that the increase in the remand population is occurring for both men and women, suggesting that the increase is not likely to be a simple response to concerns about gangs, guns, or domestic violence., In Ontario there appear to be a number of reasons for the increase in the remand population, including the following:, It would also appear that bail courts are becoming less efficient. Data from 1974 indicated that most bail decisions were made in a single appearance.  In 2007, it was taking, on average about 2.5 bail appearances for a decision to be made, an increase of about 20% from 6 years earlier., Conclusion: Given that Canada’s overall imprisonment rate has not shown the same increase as the rate of imprisonment of unsentenced prisoners, it is simplistic to suggest that the ‘remand problem’ is a result of  simple  ‘new punitiveness.’  Instead, it is argued that the institutional risks of the release of an accused are high and public.  In contrast, the benefits to criminal justice institutions of releasing an accused are hidden.  Similarly, the benefits to the institution of detaining an accused are visible. Said differently, criminal justice decision makers are seldom criticized for being ‘tough’ but are subject to criticism if they are seen as responsible for the release of an accused who might, or does, commit an offence., Reference: Webster, Cheryl Marie, Anthony N.

"Even though the laws concerning the granting of bail in England & Wales have been ‘tightened up,’ the size of the remand population has not increased.",", In 1976, laws in England & Wales were changed to a system in which it was presumed that defendants should be released while awaiting trial, unless it was believed that they would abscond, commit further offences, or interfere with witnesses. However, since that time, the laws have been toughened up. For example, detention is now presumed to be appropriate for those charged with certain offences and for those alleged to have committed offences while on bail., The overall prison population in England & Wales increased dramatically from 1980 to 2008.  Most of this increase, however, was due to an increase in sentenced prisoners.  The remand population nearly doubled in the 1980s, but since that time has not increased appreciably.  Indeed, in the past 10 years, the size of the remand population has been relatively steady. This stability stands in contrast to that of Canada and Australia each of which has shown large increases in remand populations., It is difficult to know exactly why England & Wales have managed to stabilize the size of their remand populations. Systematic research on this topic has not been carried out.  However, it is likely that the stability in the size of the remand population is the result of one or more of the following factors:, Conclusion: It is clear that there is no one ‘silver bullet’ that has kept the remand population in England & Wales from increasing. Furthermore, official policy from the government appears to favour controls on the remand population. The government wrote to courts “asking decision makers to think carefully before remanding defendants in custody” (p. 18).   It would appear that the tightening up on bail laws were “largely presentational rather than operational” (p. 19)., Reference:  Hucklesby, Anthea (2009).

People who are involved in organized crime are much more likely to be “adult onset” offenders than any other group of offenders whose pattern of offending has been studied.,", Relatively little systematic knowledge is available on those involved in organized crime.  Instead, we are generally left with individual biographies of high profile crime figures and have little idea how representative they are.  This study uses quantitative and qualitative information from judicial data sources in the Netherlands on all offenders identified as being engaged in organized crime between 1994 and 2006., In this study, groups are defined as being engaged in organized crime when their activities are primarily “focused on obtaining illegal profits, [and they] systematically commit crimes with serious damage for society, and are reasonably capable of shielding their criminal activities from the authorities” (p. 108). A total of 120 criminal groups were studied, involving 1623 offenders. All judicial contacts in the Netherlands from age 12 onwards were available to the researchers.  Information on each of the organized crime groups included interview data with police and prosecutors as well as information from interrogations, wiretaps, police observations, etc. This information was, for each group, summarized in a 20-50 page document. This paper examines the criminal careers of the 854 offenders who were in the Netherlands from age 12 onwards., The 120 groups were involved in three types of activities: drug trafficking, organized fraud (e.g., importing cigarettes without paying duty), and other illegal activities (e.g., trafficking in humans, illegal immigrants, and other illegal goods).   Four different roles were distinguished:  leaders or central figures (11%), coordinators (23%), lower level workers who are involved in the actual activities (e.g., transport of goods or people) and are easily replaceable (55%), and others (11%) such as specialists (e.g, money exchangers, forgers of documents)., The most notable finding was that at the time of the ‘organized crime’ offence that identified these offenders as participants in organized crime,  the offenders were much older (average age of 38) than ordinary offenders. Their first contacts with the justice system – occurring at an average age of 26 –  was, clearly, much later in the life cycle than is the case for ordinary offenders. The oldest organized offender was a woman who was 76 when she was first identified as an organized crime figure.  Lower level offenders tended to be slightly younger (37) at the time they were identified as organized crime figures than those who were leaders or coordinators (40 and 39, respectively).  In addition those involved in organized frauds tended to be a bit older (42) than those involved in drugs or other offences (38 and 37 years old respectively)., Four separate groups – defined by their histories of contact with the justice system – could be distinguished. A small proportion (11% overall) looked like ordinary offenders in that they started early and were relatively high rate offenders. Another group (30%) started their careers in early adolescence and continued until late adulthood. The largest group (40%) were adult-onset offenders. They did not begin offending until their 20s. Finally, there was a group of first offenders (19%) who had not had contact with the justice system before they were identified at an average age of 37 as being involved in organized crime.  The proportions in these groups did not vary dramatically across offence types or roles in the organization (except for the fact that there were larger proportion of first offenders and a slightly lower proportion of ‘early starters’ among the lower level members of the criminal organizations)., Conclusion: When looking at people involved in organized crime, it is clearly quite common that the first contact with the justice system does not occur until relatively late in life. This is very different from ordinary offenders who typically start young and finish their criminal careers early in their lives. Organized crime  may – unlike ordinary less organized crime – only be open to those who are older and have had time to develop opportunities and access., Reference: van Koppen, M.

Canada’s Youth Criminal Justice Act dramatically decreased the likelihood that police who apprehend a youth would refer that youth to court.,"Canadian police have always had the authority to decide whether to charge someone who apparently had committed an offence.  Under the youth justice law in place until 2003, they were explicitly told that ‘taking no measures or taking measures other than judicial proceedings… should be considered for dealing with young persons who have committed offences.’  But under the law that came into force in April 2003,  police were told, in the legislation, that non-court measures were often preferable, and that they were obligated to consider non-court approaches in every case (though there were no consequences of ignoring this requirement)., This study answers a simple question: Did this aspect of Canada’s Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA)  have the impact that it was designed to have – to reduce the use of court for offences brought to the attention of the police?  Using police data on the number of youths apprehended and not charged, and apprehended but charged, it would appear that the desired impact was achieved.  The data supporting this conclusion are as follows:, Conclusion.  “One of the main objectives of the YCJA was to reduce referrals to youth court in Canada…. The statute makes clear that measures other than laying a charge… such as taking no action, giving an informal warning or formal caution, or diverting to a program are entirely appropriate forms of law enforcement with young offenders” (p. 362).  The changes that took place were consistent with the intent and timing of the legislation. It would appear, therefore, that the law was remarkably successful in achieving its goals. “Part of the reason for the success of the YCJA lies in the explicit and creative drafting of the sections of the statute dealing with [measures for responding to offending outside of the court system]” (p. 363). But in addition, it may have been that this was an idea whose time had finally arrived: charge rates had been drifting slowly downward in the years preceding the implementation of the YCJA., Reference: Carrington, Peter J. and Jennifer L.

"Some, but not all, of the relationship between alcohol use and crime among adolescents is due to the fact that, whether or not they have been drinking, youths who drink alcohol are more likely to commit crimes than youths who abstain from alcohol use.",", There are two separate explanations for the relationship between alcohol use and crime.  On the one hand, it is possible that alcohol intoxication has a causal relationship with certain types of crime, especially violence. For example, alcohol impairs judgement. For example, it has been suggested that alcohol causes people to focus on the immediate situation that they are in and to ignore future costs.  Such explanations would suggest that alcohol use could play a causal role in non-violent crime since the consequences of crime would be less salient. On the other hand, it has been suggested that alcohol use among adolescents may be the result of the same risk factors (e.g., socialization factors, having delinquent friends) that make certain adolescents more likely to commit crime. If this is the case, alcohol use per se may not be a cause of crime., In a survey of 5,142  15-16 year-olds in 55 representative schools in Finland, respondents were asked whether they had engaged in a number of different offences (beating someone up, fighting, destruction of someone else’s property, graffiti, shoplifting, stealing from home, and car theft). If they had committed a particular kind of offence, they were asked if they had been drinking, when they committed the most recent incident,. They were also asked how often they drank alcohol., If there were to be a relationship between how frequently a youth drinks, generally, and how frequently that youth commits an offence when sober, such findings would suggest that at least some of the relationship between alcohol use and offending is due to a more general factor such as the youth being the ‘type’ of person who engages in both behaviours (drinking and offending).  On the other hand, if the relationship between frequency of drinking and total offending (offending when drinking and when sober) is stronger than the relationship between frequency of drinking and sober offending, it would suggest that alcohol use alone has a causal impact on offending., For all offences that were examined, the prevalence and frequency of drinking was related to committing offences when sober.  Drinkers committed more offences when sober than non-drinkers, and those who drank more frequently committed more offences when sober than those who drank less frequently.  For two offences – shoplifting and stealing from home – drinking measures were just as strongly related to offending while sober as they were to total offending, suggesting that drinking per se did not increase the likelihood of these two offences. In contrast, the results suggest that “intoxication has causal effects on adolescent violence and vandalism [in that the] drinking measures are related much more strongly to [total] delinquency than to sober delinquency for these offences” (p. 799)., Conclusion. The evidence suggests that, for certain property offences, the relationship between drinking and offending is spurious – that the relationship is not causal.  For these offences, youths who drink may be more likely to offend, but it is because of other related factors, not the use of alcohol.  For other delinquent acts – most notably violent offending – it would appear that drinking increases the likelihood of offending.   These latter results are consistent with experimental studies and with some studies of men’s violence toward their intimate partners., Reference:  Felson, Richard, Jukka Savolainen, Mikko Aaltonen, and Heta Moustgaard (2008).  Is the Association Between Alcohol Use and Delinquency Causal or Spurious?

Why has the US imprisonment rate increased so dramatically over the past three decades?  It may relate more to the structure of government than to the attitudes of ordinary citizens toward crime or punishment.,", It is often assumed that the reason US imprisonment rates increased by about 500% between the mid-1970s and mid-2000s is that ordinary citizens became upset with crime and demanded harsh penalties.  Conservative theorists suggested that “there is growing, justified outrage at what is happening to modern American society” (p. 68) that led people to demand harsh penalties. They suggest that “public opinion was well ahead of political opinion in calling attention to the rising problem of crime” (p. 268).  The only problem with this suggestion is that it does not fit the facts: “Repugnance toward serious offenders has been conspicuously common in human history, and that ‘state of nature’ cannot explain the recent emergence of the large and widening divide in harshness between the US and other democratic societies” (p. 270).  Aside from anything else, members of the public in almost all western countries hold the belief that penalties are not harsh enough., Why then, in most democratic societies, aren’t governments much tougher on ordinary crime? One possibility is that the problem of crime (which tends to affect the poor and disenfranchised more than it does those in positions of power) “is not an especially important issue in most advanced democratic systems” (p. 272).  In addition, in most democratic societies, “those places in government that set general crime policy are usually removed from review in elections and even from review by legislatures. They are located instead in parts of the executive and judicial branches of government that are distanced from direct or repressive democratic accountability” (p. 273).  Hence punishment is professionalized. The “criteria for making such decisions are regarded as involving principles that require professional judgment” (p. 273).   Furthermore, under systems that allow decision makers discretion in deciding on punishments, the decision is made “after persons to be punished become known to decision makers, [and, therefore, offenders] and their interests are transformed from abstractions into persons” (p. 273.), It is argued that the “distribution of governmental power in American criminal justice… helps to explain the salience of criminal justice as an issue….” (p. 276).  Most punishment policy in the US is state policy.  For state governments, “crime policy looms large… because it has little with which to compete” (p. 276).  Lack of confidence in government may have contributed to high rates of imprisonment since one of the important changes in US punishment policy was to move toward fixed (offence based) punishment rules and away from individualized discretionary decisions., Conclusion. “Much of the punishment hardware that facilitates leniency depends on trust in government’s expertise and benevolence.  Citizens are restrained from acting on emotions and ‘throw away the key’ sentiments when they believe that there are principles of punishment – legal proportionality, predictions of dangerousness, responsiveness to treatment – that require governmental expertise.  As soon as the claim of expertise is discredited, people on the street (or their state representatives) are every bit as expert as judges, parole boards, or correctional administrators” (p. 276). “What has always distinguished the governance of punishment in the United States from other advanced democracies is a structural vulnerability to democratic pressures that arises out of federalism, the election of prosecutors and judges, and high levels of life-threatening violence.  These enduring features have coexisted with hostility toward criminals and enthusiasm for punishment that seem typical of other advanced democracies. The combination of higher salience and distrust of government increased punishment directly and produced structural changes in sentencing that made punishments even harsher” (p. 278)., Reference: Zimring, Franklin E. and David T.

Arresting and attempting to stigmatize minority youths from high-poverty urban neighbourhoods in the U.S. has little impact on them. Mass incarceration of poor urban Blacks has already made being incarcerated the norm rather than the exception and as a result it is not stigmatizing.,", Labeling theory suggests that “formal sanctions often reinforce the very delinquent behaviours they seek to extinguish” (p. 576).  This is a particular concern because thousands of youths in poor urban neighbourhoods are arrested and incarcerated. Nevertheless, it is possible that wholesale criminalization of urban black youth has, in effect, diluted the impact of contact with the criminal justice system., As part of a larger study on the impact of juvenile sanctions on attitudes, behaviour, and school performance, twenty 18-19 year-old youths with an average of almost six officially recorded juvenile arrests were interviewed.  Most (16) had, on at least one occasion, been incarcerated. Ten of these 20 youths reported that the police had falsified evidence in their cases. Seventeen were African-American, two were of Latino descent, and one was of mixed race.  Close to half (47%) of the students in the schools attended by these youths had been involved in the juvenile justice system. Hence, being labelled as a delinquent was hardly exceptional for these youths. 
 
For these youths, being arrested was “no big thing.” “Arrests generally caused little stir outside of informants’ immediate family” (p. 585).  Part of the reason for this may be the high rate of arrest in the community.  In one school, for example, 66% of the black male youths were arrested in one year.  Although families of arrested youths were often disappointed when a youth was arrested, peer-group reactions were minimal.  Indeed, only three of the youths reported any negative impacts among their peers of being arrested.  “Thus, the first two preconditions for a ‘labeling’ effect to occur following arrest – a negative meaning endowed to the arrest and confirmatory treatment from significant others – did not always occur” (p. 590).  Only three of the 20 youths showed signs of diminished self-esteem or shame as a result of their arrests., Conclusion. “By the time of their first arrest, youths… viewed arrest as a normal part of adolescence in their communities.  The high prevalence of juvenile arrests in the community and beliefs in the pervasiveness of unwarranted arrests likely predispose many community members to take news of routine arrests lightly” (p. 594).  In effect, these youths’ crimes “were not… considered a grave violation of local norms” (p. 594).  In the poorest urban neighbourhoods, “justice system labels are not merely sewn onto individuals, but they are etched into the social fabric of the ghetto. Heavy police presence and high rates of incarceration are now fixtures of community life…. In communities devoid of meaningful educational opportunities, organized sports, jobs for youth, and valued extra-curricular activities, the justice system offers accessible, institutionally mediated means of individuation and status attainment. Accordingly, anecdotal evidence suggests that some youth, especially gang members, seem to anticipate or even value arrest or juvenile detention” (p. 596).  “Perhaps youth in some isolated neighbourhoods have developed a collective deviant or ‘oppositional’ identity as an adaptation to collective stigmatization within the larger society” (p. 597).  It would appear that if society wants youths to fear being arrested, brought to court, and incarcerated, it should not promote policies that create these as normative treatment that most youths can expect to experience., Reference: Hirschfield, Paul J.

Youths who are labelled as psychopaths by various psychological measures are no more likely to reoffend than are  youths with low scores on measures of psychopathy once the standard social and personal predictors of recidivism are taken into account.,", The search for personality measures that predict recidivism in youths is popular in large part because many youth justice systems use the likelihood of future offending as a factor in deciding what should happen to a youth who is implicated in crime.  Although there have been serious concerns raised about the adequacy of the concept of psychopathy in describing adolescents (see Criminological Highlights, V5N1#3), the fact that measures of youth psychopathic tendencies predict, to some extent, future offending lends credence to the argument that these measures are useful., The important question, when employing a construct such as psychopathy, is whether it adds to our ability to predict who will re-offend once less exotic predictors (e.g., age, past criminal behaviour, substance related problems, mental health problems such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) are taken into account.  In this paper, a group of 85 young offenders (42 sex offenders and 43 other offenders) in a secure remand facility in Florida were assessed on a number of measures of psychopathy among youths.  This is obviously the kind of population – people for whom there is special concern about re-offending – for whom careful assessments are most likely to be important.  In addition, measures were obtained of ordinary predictors of criminal activity (e.g., past offending, etc.).  Youths were tracked for re-offending for an average of about 2 years. For some analyses, a uniform time-at-risk of re-offending of about 20 months was used. Measures of violent, non-violent, weapons-related, and overall recidivism were obtained., Two of the overall measures of psychopathy were strongly correlated (r=.79) but neither of these two measures correlated well with the third adolescent psychopathy measure (r’s of .27 and .35).  The various sub-scales of each measure produced similar patterns.  More importantly, even before the standard predictors of recidivism were taken into account, none of the overall measures or their subscales showed substantial correlations with any of the measures of recidivism (no correlation exceeded 0.32, and many were not significant)., More important was the finding that once the standard predictors of recidivism -  such as past history of property offending, alcohol abuse, and age were controlled for statistically, none of the psychopathy indices added to the ability of the standard predictors to predict any form of recidivism.  The overall correlations between this set of standard predictors and recidivism were in the range of 0.60 to 0.65  -- dramatically higher than the correlations involving psychopathy alone., Conclusion. For a personality measure to be useful in predicting recidivism, it must add to our ability to identify those youths who will re-offend above and beyond the predictors of recidivism that are well known both to criminologists and to those working with youths (e.g., past criminal behaviour, alcohol use, age).  These three standard measures of psychopathy consistently failed this “incremental” test.  Said differently, the study suggests that there is no justification for using any of these psychopathy measures to predict future offending, given that ordinary measures are far better for this purpose., Reference: Douglas, Kevin S., Monica E. Epstein, and Norman G. Poythress (2008). Criminal Recidivism Among Juvenile Offenders: Testing the Incremental and Predictive Validity of Three Measures of Psychopathic Features.

"Although victims and offenders report being very satisfied with the outcome of restorative justice programs for adults and the programs, overall, reduce the frequency of offending, there does not appear to be convincing evidence that these programs consistently reduce the likelihood or the severity of offending.",", Restorative justice programs typically have a number of different goals, only one of which is to reduce recidivism (see Criminological Highlights, V6N5#1). More generally, restorative justice has been defined as “a process whereby parties with a stake in a specific offence collectively resolve how to deal with the aftermath of the offence and its implications for the future” (p. 1).  This paper looks at three restorative justice programs, dealing largely with adult offenders.  The restorative justice process used in these programs was in addition to normal criminal justice processing.  Hence, the restorative justice procedure (e.g., mediation or a conference) might take place after a finding of guilt or after a final warning had been given.  Thirteen separate sub-programs involving restorative justice interventions were assessed In some of the sub-studies, participants were randomly assigned – after agreeing to participate in a restorative justice conference – either to receive the conference or not. In other programs, participants were matched with comparable offenders who had not been given the opportunity to participate., Offenders were followed for two years after the restorative justice intervention took place. One difficulty in assessing these 13 interventions is that most of them had few participants.  Hence, for an effect to be statistically significant, the impact of the intervention on recidivism would have to have been quite dramatic or consistent.  In fact, in terms of the reduction in offending – defined as the presence of at least one reconviction within two years or the average severity of the reconvictions – there was only one program (out of 13) in one location in which the restorative intervention reduced offending. That program involved a conference that took place after a guilty plea and before sentencing for property offenders. Summing across all 13 of the interventions, there was no consistent impact of the restorative justice intervention on whether or not the person reoffended or on the severity of the subsequent offences. However, there was an overall significant decrease in the frequency of reoffending.  Moreover, for the most successful of the programs, the savings to society from reduced offending were larger than the cost of mounting the restorative justice programs. Furthermore, given that restorative justice programs are well received both by victims and by offenders, it is also important to note that there were no significant findings suggesting any criminogenic effects of restorative justice programs., The study attempted to discover the types of cases for which restorative approaches were most effective.  Unfortunately, “it is not possible to predict, from this evaluation, that one offender will be more likely to benefit from restorative justice than another on the basis of their prior characteristics” (p. 67)., Conclusion:   The restorative justice programs examined in this paper were designed to accomplish a number of goals – reducing recidivism was only one of them.  The adult offenders in these programs, many of whom had been found guilty of serious offences tended to commit fewer offences in the two years following the intervention than did those who did not experience the restorative justice program. However, the programs did not reduce the likelihood that offenders would offend at least once, nor did the restorative justice intervention reduce the severity of reconvictions.  In other published reports on these same evaluations, very high levels of satisfaction were found for both offenders and victims.  It may be that the findings on satisfaction of the participants, alone, justify continued interest and investigation of restorative justice programs even though their impact on recidivism is less consistent across measures., Reference: Shapland, Joanna, Ann Atkinson, Helen Atkinson, James Dignan, Lucy Edwards, Jeremy Hibbert, Marie Howes, Jennifer Johnstone, Gwen Robinson, and Angela Sorsby (2008).

Juries use an accused person’s criminal record to convict defendants when the evidence against the accused is weak.,", A principal reason for criminal defendants’ decisions not to testify in jury trials is that they have criminal records. Jurors typically only hear about the prior criminal record of accused persons if they testify. The fear is that the jury would convict, not because of the evidence, but because the defendant was already a proven criminal.  In some jurisdictions, judges must decide on the admissibility of a criminal record of an accused person by balancing two things:  the value of the evidence of the criminal record of the accused person in determining the credibility of the accused and the possible prejudicial impact of the criminal record on the verdict in the case., This study examined 358 jury trials in 2000-2001, largely involving minority (Black or Hispanic) defendants, in four large urban locations in the U.S.. Case information was gathered from the court clerk (on such factors as whether the accused testified and whether the jury found out about the criminal record, the jury decision, and information about the accused). Before the jury returned with a verdict, trial judges rated such matters as the strength of the evidence and what their own verdict would have been. After their deliberations, jurors gave ratings of various parts of the case., In cases in which defendants testified, judges reported that the testimony of the accused was – on average – more important than all other evidence except that of the victim and eyewitnesses. Not surprisingly, defendants were more likely to testify in cases in which they did not have a criminal record (62% testifying) than when they had a criminal record (45%).   This is largely due to an effect for minority defendants. 62% of minority defendants without a criminal record testified compared to only 43% of those with a criminal record.  The comparable figures for whites were 67% and 61%, respectively.  When the accused had a criminal record and testified, the jury found out about the record in 52% of the cases.  If the accused did not testify, the jury seldom (9%) found out about the record., One would expect that the criminal record of the accused would have the strongest impact for cases in which the evidence against the accused was weak.  In cases in which the evidence is very strong, one would expect that the criminal record would not matter.  Consistent with this, in cases with relatively weak evidence in which the jury heard of the accused criminal record, the likelihood of conviction was higher than if the jury did not hear about the record.  In relatively strong cases, only the strength of the evidence predicted whether the defendant was convicted., Defendants with criminal records were rated as being just as believable as defendants without criminal records. This result is similar to findings from experimental research. The impact of criminal record does not, therefore, appear to operate through the legally permissible mechanism of defendant credibility.  Rather it appears to have a direct impact on the likelihood of a finding of guilt., Conclusion. It would appear that “One could view the prior record as ‘making up’ for evidentiary deficiencies” (p. 30).   It may be that jurors infer guilt directly from the knowledge that the accused has been found guilty at least once in the past. Or it could be that the threshold necessary for a finding of guilt drops in cases in which the accused has a record, on the assumption that it matters less if an innocent accused with a criminal record is found guilty than if the accused does not have a criminal record.  Finally, it is possible that the criminal record changes the meaning of the evidence against an accused. The same evidence may be seen as being more incriminating if the accused has a record.  In any case, it appears that a defendant’s criminal record promotes findings of guilt in exactly the cases – those with weak evidence – in which wrongful convictions are most likely to occur., Reference: Eisenberg, Theodore and Valerie P.

Another quick-fix crime prevention program is shown to be ineffective. Teen courts – in which decisions concerning juvenile offenders are made by peers – may even increase the likelihood of future offending.,", Teen courts are designed to divert youths who have apparently committed minor offences from traditional youth courts into settings in which other adolescents take an active role in deciding what should happen to the offender. It is estimated that there are now over 1000 such programs operating in the U.S., processing nearly 100,000 cases.  One reason that they may be so popular is that they are designed – consistent with many restorative justice programs – to try to make the offender aware of the impact of the offence on the victim., Though there are many stories of successes, the teen court literature suffers from the absence of comparison groups.  At best, it could be said that there have been some encouraging results in some locations, but not others. In this study, youths in Maryland who met the eligibility criteria for teen courts were randomly assigned either to be processed in the normal way or in a teen court. They were not given a choice as to which program they participated in, but youths in both groups had the choice of whether they participated in the research.  Four months after they had participated either in ‘normal’ processing or in the teen court, the youths answered confidential questions about drug use and general delinquent behaviour. In addition, official records related to police apprehensions were searched for a period 18 months after referral to the programs., In terms of official recidivism (measured as re-arrest), there was not a significant difference between the groups, but if anything, the re-arrest rate was slightly higher for the youths who were assigned to the teen court.  In addition, on the self-report measures, the teen court participants were, if anything, more likely to report drug use and being involved in delinquent behaviour.  On various attitude measures, the results, if anything, suggested that traditional treatment of these youths was more effective than the teen court., Conclusion. As the authors point out, in the US “enormous amounts of time and money are spent on teen court programs each year, without strong evidence of their effectiveness” (p. 150).  Though the effects were not strong, if anything the results suggest that “teen court youth were consistently found to have less favourable outcomes than those in the [traditional youth court] sample” (p. 151).  Such findings are not surprising and might well have been predicted from various perspectives.   It is possible, for example, that the youths feel stigmatized by the process of being ‘shamed’ in front of their peers as opposed to the more traditional anonymous court process.  In addition, it is possible that some of the sanctions imposed by the teen court (e.g., tours of detention centres – see Criminological Highlights, 6(2)#4)  may have had negative impacts.  But the point remains: giving the responsibility for sanctioning of minor offenders to other youths appears, if anything, to have negative impacts on those being sanctioned., Reference: Stickle, Wendy Povitsky, Nadine M.

The manner in which a school is run has an impact on the amount of school-based delinquency above and beyond the characteristics of the students in the school.,"It is understandable that many people focus on the characteristics of the student body when trying to understand how much delinquency takes place in a school.  In addressing crime problems in schools, others may focus on various ‘crime prevention’ approaches to delinquency (e.g., searching students for weapons, police in schools, monitoring of students).  This paper examines the hypothesis that communally run schools in which students feel that they are part of the school community will have less school-based delinquency than schools run in an autocratic non-communal fashion., There is some evidence that well-run schools have fewer crime problems (see Criminological Highlights 4(2)#4).  Just as communities that have high levels of informal social control and cohesion appear to have lower levels of crime (see Criminological Highlights 1(2)#2), schools that have “supportive relationships between and among teachers, administrators and students; a common set of goals and norms; and a sense of collaboration and involvement” (p. 430) may have a climate that discourages delinquent acts.  This study examines the impact of communally organized schools and the attachment of students to the schools on the amount of delinquency that takes place in the school., Data were collected from students and teachers in 253 public secondary schools in the United States. Students were asked about their attachment to their schools and teachers (e.g., whether they cared about teachers’ views of them and whether they were happy in school).  Teachers were asked about the school organization (e.g., whether they viewed the school administration as being supportive and collaborative) and whether they perceived that the goals of the schools were clear to everyone. Students were also asked whether they had engaged, in the previous year, in various forms of offending (e.g., damaging school property, assaulting or threatening teachers or other adults in the school)., Above and beyond various characteristics of the school and the students (e.g., the racial makeup of the student body, the poverty of the area, whether the school was in an urban area), youths who were enrolled in schools characterized by supportive and collaborative relations and well-established norms and goals were less likely to engage in delinquent behaviour.   Students in schools with these characteristics were also more likely to report high levels of ‘bonding’ to the school.   Not surprisingly, “students who are more attached to school and to education and who give more legitimacy to school rules are less likely to be delinquent” (p. 443) than are students who do not see school in this way.  Finally it appears that “when the school community is strong, there is less of a need for individual-level controls [e.g., school bonding] to protect against delinquency. However, when the school community is weak, there is a greater need for individual-level controls, and the protective effect that student bonding has on delinquency is stronger” (p. 448)., Conclusion.  Clearly the social organization of a school has an impact on an individual student’s involvement in delinquency.  These findings suggest “the great potential for school-based delinquency prevention.

The harmful effects of imprisoning large numbers of people from a community extend beyond those incarcerated and their immediate families: the communities themselves can show the impact of high imprisonment policies.,", It is well known that imprisonment can hurt the life chances of those who are incarcerated. Imprisonment of drug offenders, for example, may act to increase recidivism (e.g., see  Criminological Highlights 5(2)#3).  Imprisonment also reduces the ability of men to get a job (Criminological Highlights 6(3)#2) and even if they do find employment, being imprisoned appears to have a permanent impact on a person’s wages (Criminological Highlights 5(3)#7).  This paper suggests that concentrated incarceration may go beyond these individual impacts and may harm the communities themselves., Whether a country has a high or a low rate of imprisonment, imprisonment is concentrated in some communities more than others.  Men are much more likely to be imprisoned than women.  In the United States, men are almost 15 times more likely to be imprisoned than women. (In Canada, the rate of imprisonment (average counts) of men is about 17 times that of women.) In addition, imprisonment is concentrated in certain racial or ethnic groups (e.g., Blacks, Aboriginal persons), the young, and people who are educationally and economically disadvantaged.  One study found that the result of this concentration is that in some poor neighbourhoods in some U.S. cities, almost one in five males age 18-44 is in prison on any given day. Another study estimated that about a third of young males in certain neighbourhoods are incarcerated for at least some period each year., The impact of this level of concentrated imprisonment is widespread., Conclusion. Although few would question the necessity of imprisoning some offenders, this paper suggests that, in addition to direct financial costs to society and personal costs to the offender, there are a range of almost inevitable negative impacts of incarceration on communities.  It would be sensible, then, for governments to consider these costs when debating changes in laws that might affect imprisonment rates., Reference: Clear, Todd (2008).

"Allowing youths, age 16 and older, to work long hours while still in school may reduce delinquent behaviour, but may, simultaneously, encourage them to drop out of school.",", Since the mid-1980s, concern has been expressed about the impact of ‘intensive work’ (i.e., more than 20 hours per week) on youths. “Virtually without exception, empirical research has indicated that youths who work during the school year, particularly those who work intensively, are at higher risk of delinquent behaviour” (p. 341).  However, this relationship could come about as a result of selection: those youths with backgrounds and experiences that make them more likely to offend may also be more likely to work during high school (see Criminological Highlights 8(6)#4). This means that it is important not simply to compare the offending rates of working youths to non-working youths, but to compare working youths to comparably situated non-working youths. In the United States, federal law restricts the number of hours that youths under age 16 can work during the school year. There is considerable variability across states in laws regulating working hours for youths 16 and older. This study takes advantage of this state-to-state variation in order to assess the impact of work on youths’ offending, drug use, and performance in school., The study examines the work experience and self-reported offending of 2,224 youths who were not employed in a formal job at age 15 when they were interviewed as part of a larger study.  They were interviewed again, when 16 years old.  At that time, they were asked about employment, involvement in offending and whether they had been arrested in the previous year. In addition, they were asked about school suspensions, grades, and whether they had dropped out of school.   Various standard control variables (e.g., residential mobility, household size) were also included in the age 16 survey questionnaire., In terms of simple effects, working longer hours had uniformly negative consequences for behaviour. Those who worked longer hours when 16 were more likely to engage in delinquent behaviour, more likely to use drugs, and more likely to be arrested. At school, they were more likely to be suspended, to have low grades, and to drop out of school., However, when the child labour laws of the various states are taken into account – policies that are more or less independent of any pre-existing behavioural tendencies on the part of the youth – the results are very different.  Here we see that the transition to intensive work (permitted in some states and not others and more or less independent of pre-existing tendencies of the youths) “corresponds with a significant and substantial decrease in delinquency and [school] suspensions” (p. 354).  However, “the adverse effect of work intensity on school dropout remains robust, and in fact increases…” (p. 354)., Conclusion.  This study directly examines the impact of child labour laws on changes in behaviour of youths as they move from more restrictive federal laws (at age 15) to state laws of varying restrictiveness (at age 16).  First-time formal work at age 16 appears to have some benefits in terms of protecting youths from delinquencies, but also has some costs, in that these same youths are more likely to drop out of school., Reference: Apel, Robert, Shawn D.

The New Zealand government orchestrated an attempt to end high rates of adult imprisonment.,", Between 1996 and 2006, the rate of imprisonment in New Zealand climbed from a relatively high 130 to 188 prisoners per hundred thousand residents.  In comparison, Canada’s 2006 imprisonment rate was about 106 and England & Wales’ was about 145.  The rate in the U.S. was about 751.  But in August 2006, New Zealand’s Prime Minister announced that her government’s goal was “to get the imprisonment rate back to something more consistent with the countries we consider our peers… The criminal justice system cannot go on as it is [with] an unacceptably high rate of imprisonment” (p. 364).  She pointed out that prison levels had become “economically and socially unsustainable” (p. 365).  This paper examines how high imprisonment lost its legitimacy in New Zealand., In the first few decades after World War II, criminal justice policy was seen to be the domain of experts in New Zealand.  However, from the 1970s onwards, there appeared to be a loss of confidence in criminal justice experts, culminating in a nonbinding referendum in 1999, supported by 92% of voters, arguing for tougher treatment of offenders. In this context, “appearing to be ‘soft on crime’ might spell political disaster” (p. 370).  News reporting about crime was almost always superficial and supportive of the tough-on-crime lobby.  In 2002 legislation, “judges were encouraged to make more use of maximum penalties,” parole was to be restricted, and other provisions were brought in that increased levels of imprisonment.  A grass roots organization, the Sensible Sentencing Trust, founded in 2001, pressured continually for harsher penalties. The main political parties competed to see who could be ‘tougher’ on crime., Soon after the 2005 election, however, planning was initiated to change direction.  Efforts involved the New Zealand Law Reform Commission and the government. Ministers and others were sent to Finland to understand how they had reduced imprisonment in the 1970s and 1980s (see Criminological Highlights 3(5)#1,  6(1)#7). Ministers started describing New Zealand’s imprisonment rate as a scandal pointing out that the country had the second highest imprisonment rate in the western world.  The press began reporting on degrading and debasing prison conditions. Prison construction costs began rapidly to exceed earlier estimates.  Reports came out that prisoners did essentially nothing in prison and the press covered the rehabilitative inadequacies of New Zealand’s prison.  British academics were imported to help explain the misinformed nature of public opinion on crime and punishment matters.  Though the imprisonment rate hit 202 per hundred thousand residents in September 2007, it had dropped to 185 by April 2008. Obviously, it is impossible to know whether the attempts to change policy will be effective in the long term, especially in light of inevitable high profile violent crimes, one of which occurred in 2007., Conclusion. The change in policy in New Zealand is interesting because, like that in Finland, the policy explicitly targeted prison population size and because international comparisons were used as arguments in favour of a change in direction.  There are signs that those who determine imprisonment policy in other countries – Britain and parts of the United States, in particular – may also be concerned about the size of the prison population, in part because of resource concerns.  In the end, however, “just like any other system of power, one that is heavily influenced by penal populism will be dependent on the legitimacy of its promise and what it actually achieves” (p. 379)., Reference: Pratt, John (2008).  When Penal Populism Stops: Legitimacy, Scandal and the Power to Punish in New Zealand.  The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology, 41(3), 364-383., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV10N21.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-10-no-2-%E2%80%93-february-2009,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 10, No. 2 – February 2009",Regular Issue,2009
"The future impact of laws that ‘toughen’ sentences can be modelled. In California, legislative efforts to toughen sentencing laws have had – and will continue to have - dramatic effects on the size of the prison population.  This increase consists largely of drug – not violent -  offenders.",", In 1976, California shifted from an indeterminate to a determinate sentencing regime. Since that time, the California legislature has enacted over 1,000 new laws related to sentencing policy (more than 400 in the 1990s alone). In addition, there have been numerous ballot initiatives in which citizens, not their legislators, created sentencing provisions. The result of these changes is that California’s imprisonment rate grew by 484% between 1980 and 2006 (from 98 per hundred thousand residents to 475. These figures exclude local jails and those in federal prisons.), This paper develops a model of California imprisonment during the final two decades of the 20th century, and then uses that model to project what will occur for the next couple of decades based on various political choices.  During the period 1980-1998, the number of state prisoners increased from about 20 thousand to about 160 thousand. The proportion of violent prisoners, however, went down from 64% to 44%. In contrast, drug offenders constituted 10% of prisoners in 1980 and 32% in 1998.  Given that one of the big changes in policy that took place during this period was to increase sentence length (largely because of the focus of the new sentencing laws on criminal records), it is not surprising that the proportion of prisoners 35 years old and older increased from 23% to 41% and the number of those with two or more prior convictions increased from 11% to 27%. The proportion of female prisoners increased from 5% to 8%., If the three strikes law of 1994 is fully implemented (e.g., in terms of actual release dates), the proportion of prisoners incarcerated for violent crimes would decrease slightly between now and 2030, and the proportion of drug offenders would continue to increase (to 46%). This scenario also predicts that women, in 2030, would constitute 18% of prisoners.  Restricting three strikes eligibility to violent offenders would reduce the increase in prison population to a 65% increase in size by 2030 compared to 79% for the ‘full’ 3-strikes law.   The proportion of violent offenders in prison would remain essentially unchanged, but the proportion of blacks and women would grow in a similar fashion to the predictions for the ‘full’ three strikes model. However, “as wide and sweeping as the potential consequences of California’s Three Strikes law appear in the abstract, they pale in comparison to the cumulative effects of the earlier changes made to California sentencing policy” (p. 260)., Conclusion. These cumulative impacts of California’s sentencing laws demonstrate that whatever its stated purposes might be, California’s complex sentencing structure (including the three-strikes laws) is “clearly not defensible on the basis that it makes the public safer by incapacitating dangerous offenders” (p. 261). Though a modified system of 3-strikes that focuses only on those with a violent criminal history might result in a prison population with slightly higher levels of dangerousness, “it still does not perform terribly well in the context of the existing system” (p. 261). Thus far it is clear that “two decades of sentencing policy reforms conceived and implemented with the goal of making California’s citizens safer have, in fact, resulted in a prison population that is more than four times the size and substantially less dangerous than it was in 1980” (p. 262). “The most prominent promise of criminal sentencing policy reform in California… has been to protect the public from dangerous offenders…. California has faltered miserably on this promise” (p. 262)., Reference: Auerhahn, Kathleen (2008).

"Circle sentencing – as an alternative sentencing process for adult offenders – has no impact on re-offending of Aboriginal people in New South Wales, Australia.",", Circle sentencing for Aboriginal people in New South Wales is used as an alternative to traditional sentencing. It involves the offender, magistrate, and various people from the community.  In New South Wales “Circle sentencing has the full sentencing powers of the court” (p. 1).  It is seen as having a number of distinct purposes, only one of which is to reduce recidivism in Aboriginal communities.  This study looks only at that one goal., The obvious challenge in research of this kind is to find an appropriate comparison group since reoffending rates vary across characteristics of offenders as well as across time within groups of offenders.  A sample of 68 circle sentencing participants from courts outside of Sydney who were not imprisoned was tracked for 15 months after their participation in the circle.  An equivalent group of Aboriginal offenders matched on age, gender, offence, prior record and prior imprisonment was used for comparison purposes. About half of these offenders were being sentenced for common assault. The next most frequent offences were unlicensed driving and breaching an apprehended violence order., Three measures of reoffending were used: frequency of offending (defined as the number of proven offences), the time between the end of the circle process (or court process in the case of the comparison group) and the next offence, and change in offence seriousness (for those who did re-offend)., The need for a comparison group is clear when comparing offending during the 15 months prior to the reference offence to offending for the 15 months after.  Most (78%) of the circle sentencing participants reduced their frequency of offending, but this is also true of the control group in which 77% showed lower rates of offending in the 15 months after the reference offence. Overall 46% of the circle sentencing group committed at least one offence in the 15 months following the circle, compared to 38% in the comparison group.  For both groups, the offence which followed the reference offence tended to be less serious, but the difference was not significant., A separate analysis using 153 Aboriginal adults who had experienced circle sentencing was used to determine whether there was a difference in the time to the next proven offence for the two groups. Using a much larger comparison group, and controlling statistically for various factors related to re-conviction, participation in circle sentencing was not a significant predictor of time to reoffend., Conclusion.  “Taken as a whole, the evidence presented here suggests that circle sentencing has no effect on the frequency, timing or seriousness of offending” (p. 7). However, “it should not be concluded that circle sentencing has no value simply because it does not appear to have any short-term impact on reoffending.  Reducing recidivism is just one of several objectives of the process. There is nothing in this analysis to suggest that circle sentencing is not meeting the other objectives” (p. 7)., Reference: Fitzgerald, Jacqueline (2008).

"Some school programs aimed at reducing the use of illicit drugs do reduce drug use. However, many of the more common types of programs are ineffective.",", School-based programs designed to reduce illicit drug use vary widely.  Many intuitively sensible sounding ideas have been incorporated into these programs, but relatively few of them have been adequately tested.  This study examines what we know about the programs that have been shown to be effective., It is likely that most school-based attempts to reduce illicit drug use have never been adequately evaluated.  For this study, 149 studies evaluating school-based drug prevention programs were located.  Unfortunately, however, most (91) of these evaluations were inadequate for a variety of reasons (e.g., the absence of any comparison group; inadequate data on which to evaluate whether a comparison group was, indeed comparable; attitudes towards illicit drugs were measured rather than actual illicit drug use).  The remaining 58 studies provided 61 unique treatment comparisons., Programs that targeted marijuana use showed overall positive effects.  However, school-based programs that targeted other illicit drugs (e.g., cocaine and amphetamines) did not show positive effects., Many types of programs appeared to be largely ineffective, for example, those based on passive information dissemination about drugs and those that focused on interpersonal development such as self-esteem enhancement and improving personal decision making through self-reflection. Similarly, programs that were designed to “increase awareness of social influences” and to “develop skills for resisting substance use influences” are also likely to be ineffective.  The programs that emphasized the teaching of generic life skills (communication, problem solving, stress management and other socially relevant skills) appeared to have the highest proportion of positive outcomes (i.e., the majority of these programs appeared to be effective in reducing the use of illicit drugs)., All programs – even within a type of intervention – are not equally effective. Programs focusing on all students were more effective than programs targeting those students perceived by the school or others to be in need of such programs.  There seemed to be some indication that youths in the middle years of school (i.e., not primary or high school) are most likely to benefit from school based programs. To be effective, programs need to have a high level of interactivity – passive learning is not effective in reducing the use of illicit drugs. The more intensive a program is – defined by the number of sessions involved in it – the more likely it will be effective.  Having a booster session after a program was completed seemed to be irrelevant., Conclusion.  There is no guarantee of the effectiveness of any program designed to reduce illicit drug use. However, intensive interactive universal programs delivered during the middle school years that adopt social influence or competency enhancement components appear to have the highest likelihood of being effective.  Given the fact that no program can, a priori, be assumed to be effective, it is important that any new program be carefully and competently evaluated., Reference: Soole, David W., Lorraine Mazerolle, and Sacha Rombouts (2008).

"Even though political leaders sometimes suggest otherwise, members of the public do not generally want youths to be treated as adults in criminal justice matters.",", Many youth justice systems have mechanisms whereby young people who commit certain offences can be dealt with as adults – at trial, sentencing, and/or for correctional purposes.  In the United States, treating increasing numbers of youths as adults for criminal justice purposes became popular toward the end of the last century, challenging the purpose and the value of having separate justice systems for youths accused of offending., Simple surveys of ordinary citizens support the conclusion that many people want youths charged with certain serious offences to be dealt with as adults, though this support seems to vary with the age of the offender and certain circumstances of the offence.  However, it would appear that support varies somewhat depending on how a question is asked. The public appears to be more punitive in response to ‘global questions’ than to questions in which they are given information on specific characteristics of the youths or the circumstances of their crimes., In this study of public attitudes (in the state of Florida), people’s views about whether youths should be handled in a separate system were measured in a number of different ways.  They were asked whether “having a separate court system to handle juvenile cases makes good sense” and whether “juveniles who commit violent crimes should be tried as adults” (p. 58).  In addition, people were given a specific case described in a short vignette that varied by offence and various characteristics of the youth (age, race, sex, criminal record, whether the offence was committed alone or with other youths, and the relative maturity of the youth)., Most respondents (79%) approved in principle the policy that there should be a separate youth court, but most (73%) also thought that youths who commit serious crimes should be tried as adults.  At the same time, by far the most popular sentencing goal for youth sentencing was rehabilitation (95% saw it as “extremely important”). Other goals (retribution, specific and general deterrence, and incapacitation) were seen as relatively important, but the proportion of the population seeing them as extremely important was considerably lower (ranging from 57% for retribution to 22% for incapacitation). The perceived importance of these punishment goals did not, however, relate to the respondents’ views of whether a youth should be transferred to adult court.  Youths who were described as having a criminal record or who were perceived as relatively mature for their age were seen as more appropriate candidates for transfer to adult court. Not surprisingly, those who were described as having committed a violent or drug offence also were seen as more appropriately dealt with in adult court., Even though all of the offenders described in the vignettes were eligible for transfer, only those who were described as having committed very serious offences and those with extensive criminal record were seen by the majority of respondents as appropriate cases for transfer.  Those who believed that adult court would be more likely to impose the punishment that the youth deserved were more likely to want youths to be transferred.  Similarly, those who thought that the youth would be more likely to be rehabilitated in the adult system favoured transfer., Conclusion. It would appear that “People want juveniles who are accused of serious offences to be held responsible for their actions, and they see transfer as a mechanism for achieving this goal. Thus, the extent of transfers in the future may hinge, at least in part, on the capacity of the juvenile justice system to show that is an instrument of accountability” (p. 72-73)., Reference: Applegate, Brandon K., Robin King Davis, and Francis T.

"Canada’s Youth Criminal Justice Act was successful in reducing the use of incarceration of young people in large part because the police, the trial courts, and the Supreme Court of Canada have interpreted the Act within the spirit in which it was approved by Parliament.","Canada’s Young Offenders Act, which came into effect in 1984, was seen as being ‘soft on crime’ even though many professional observers believed that Canada made too much use of youth court and custodial sentences for youths.  In 2003, its replacement – the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) – came into effect with the explicit goal of reducing the use of formal sanctions especially for minor offences., Previous research (Criminological Highlights 10(1)#1) has shown that the YCJA was unambiguously responsible for a reduction in the proportion of  youths apprehended by the police who were subsequently referred to youth court.  The principles governing the operation of the YCJA explicitly state that youths should be dealt with outside of the court if such an approach is adequate.  The data reported in this paper are quite clear: there was a dramatic drop in all regions of Canada in the proportion of cases taken to court when the YCJA was implemented. This paper examines the implementation of the YCJA by the police and courts and in particular it reports on trends in the use of custody from 1997/8 until 2007/8., The principles of the YCJA made it clear that custodial sentences were to be used sparingly.  The Supreme Court of Canada has held that deterrence is not a relevant sentencing principle for youth. Furthermore, the Act set down four very specific ‘gateways’ or hurdles to custody. These gateways have also been narrowly construed by the Supreme Court., The proportion of those youths apprehended by the police who were sent to court dropped dramatically when the YCJA came into effect. One might have expected, therefore, that the proportion of those found guilty who were subsequently incarcerated would, if anything, increase.  Presumably, cases in court would on average be more serious under the YCJA than they had been in the past. However, the proportion of those found guilty who were incarcerated dropped from 27% of those found guilty in the last year of the previous law to 22% in the first year of the YCJA. This trend continued such that by 2006/7 only 17% of those found guilty were incarcerated.  Looking at the overall rate of placing youths in custody, changes in police discretion and sentencing meant that in 2006/7 there were 219 youths placed in custody per hundred thousand youths compared to 526 four years earlier.  The average daily count of the youth custodial population shows a decrease from about 108 per hundred thousand youths in 2002/3 to about 60 in 2003/4 and 38 in 2007/8.  While there are provisions of the YCJA that were intended to reduce use of pre-trial detention, there has not been a decline in the use of remand custody under the Act. There were about 36 youths in custody per hundred thousand youths in the population in 2007/8 – which was about the same as it had been 7 years earlier., Conclusion. “In general, the police, prosecutors, and judges in Canada have responded to the admonition in the Preamble [to the YCJA] that the Act is intended to ‘reduce the over-reliance on the incarceration… of young persons’.”   In cases involving more serious offences or youths with lengthy records who have not responded to community-based options, youth courts have continued to impose custodial sentences.”   Nevertheless, “despite the success of the YCJA in achieving its principal objective, youth justice issues remain controversial in Canada.”, Reference.

Coming from a ‘troubled’ family or having a father who had been incarcerated increases a youth’s chances of being placed in custody for relatively minor offending.,", Youth justice systems vary somewhat on the principles that are supposed to guide court dispositions.  Beginning with the first juvenile courts in the late 19th century, American and Canadian juvenile courts were expected to make decisions about youths based to a large extent on the theory that they could craft dispositions that would reduce the likelihood of reoffending. Though Canadian legislation has moved toward a more offence-based orientation in its youth sentencing provisions, judges in any jurisdiction who are inclined to follow ‘child welfare’ principles in sentencing youths might be expected to focus much of their attention on the characteristics of youths’ families – in contrast with characteristics of youths themselves. Such an orientation might well have a profound impact on the treatment that youths receive from the court.  This study – carried out in a jurisdiction in which rehabilitating the youth was meant to be a dominant factor in deciding youth court dispositions – examines the manner in which youths’ families can affect whether an out-of-home placement is imposed on them., The study examined 325 case files of youths being sentenced in juvenile court in Arizona. The most serious cases in this jurisdiction involving older youths would have been dealt with by the adult criminal courts.  The case files were examined in order to see if the court had been informed of any history of incarceration of the youth’s father or mother and whether there was an explicit mention of “family dysfunction.” For example, a probation officer’s report in one case noted that “The parenting at home is poor and there seems to be drugs and alcohol involved… The family system is very dysfunctional… The only way that [the youth] can actually address [the serious issues he needs to address] is if he is away from the home and placed in a secure setting….” (p. 193).  The goal of the study was to see if the incarceration of parents and/or the assessment that the family was dysfunctional affected the likelihood of out-of-home placement. Various other factors were controlled statistically (race, age, whether the youth was in court for an offence against persons, living arrangements such as whether it was a single parent household, and the number of times that the youth had previously been referred to court)., Fourteen percent of the 325 cases resulted in an out-of-home placement.   Not surprisingly, those with more prior referrals to court were more likely to be placed out of the home.  Black youths and youths already in foster care were more likely to receive out-of-home dispositions as were younger youths. This last finding may be the result of the fact that in Arizona those 15 and older who commit serious violent offences automatically are transferred to criminal court and dealt with as adults.  Above and beyond the characteristics of the youths themselves, those who were described as coming from dysfunctional families were considerably more likely than other youths to receive an out-of-home placement.  In addition, those youths whose files indicated that their fathers had, at some time, been incarcerated were also more likely to receive an out-of-home placement., Conclusion. The juvenile court was founded, in part, on the belief that in some cases “the parents could not make appropriate decisions for the youth and the court should step in and serve as parens patriae” (p. 197).  To a large extent the decision to place a youth out of the home appears to relate to court officials’ judgments about whether the youth came from a good or bad family and “their assessments of whether the family can provide care, supervision, and control over the youth within the community” (p. 198).  To the extent that placement out of the home is seen by the youth and others as a punishment, it would appear that the sins of the parents are, in effect, visited upon their children., Rodriguez, Nancy, Hilary Smith, and Marjorie S.

"Coordinated, well-resourced, court-based judicial oversight programs designed to address violence against women by intimate partners cannot be counted on to reduce violence.",", Various criminal justice responses to violence against women by intimate partners have been tried over the past few decades.  These include mandatory arrest and/or charge practices, “no-drop” prosecution policies, and various legal controls (e.g., peace bonds or civil protection orders).  There are, at best, mixed results on the impact of these policies on the safety of women (e.g.,  Criminological Highlights 1(6)#8, 5(6)#4, 5(2)#7, 7(6)#5).  The suggestion has been made, therefore, that what is needed is a more coordinated response to intimate partner violence that is overseen by judges. This study examines the impact of well-organized judicial oversight programs on offender recidivism and victims’ feelings of safety and well-being., The core elements of the judicial oversight projects involved uniform and consistent responses by law enforcement personnel to domestic violence offences, coordinated victim advocacy and services including contact with victim services, and the development of safety plans for victims. In addition, offenders were supervised by the court and referred to treatment programs.  Criminal justice personnel were given expanded and specialized training for the program and dedicated prosecution units were established. Comparison sites in two relatively similar counties in which ordinary responses to intimate partner violence took place were identified for two of the programs. In the judicially coordinated programs, cases typically involving physical assaults, and often quite severe assaults, were identified and tracked for about a year. Victims were interviewed twice. The programs that victims and offenders participated in were identified.  Similar tracking took place in the comparison counties, but no special programs were implemented., The findings suggest that women who lived in the counties in which judicial oversight took place did, in fact, receive more contact with prosecutors, probation, and treatment and other services.  However, there was no evidence that women whose cases were subject to coordinated judicial oversight perceived themselves to be safer.  In addition, there were inconsistent findings on victimization.  There was no reduction in violence attributable to the program in one state, but there was some evidence of less subsequent violence for victims in another.  Although the programs appeared to be well-implemented in both locations, it would appear that the reductions in repeat violence occurred in the jurisdiction that revoked probationers for non-compliance. “The implication is that the reduction [in violence] resulted from incapacitating abusers who failed to comply with probation conditions rather than deterring offenders” (p. 519).  Nevertheless, the overall rate of re-victimization was fairly high across both locations: 28% of the victims in the program were physically assaulted within 11 months of the initial incident compared to 35% in the non-program control county. Slightly more than half of the women in both groups reported that they had experienced threats and intimidation since the initial violent incident., Conclusion.  The results suggest that those positive effects that did exist (a small but inconsistent reduction in re-victimization on some measures) may have been the simple result of offenders having been incarcerated because of breaches of probation.  The more basic problem may be that criminal justice solutions are, inherently, inadequate in dealing effectively with intimate partner violence.  As one commentator on this study noted, it is unfortunate that the resources typically available for non-criminal interventions (e.g., shelters, job training, welfare and housing services) are dwarfed by funding for criminal justice interventions.  If the goal of interventions is to make women’s lives safer, then perhaps more effective means of intervening (i.e., something other than simple coordinated judicial oversight of court based programs) need to be found., Reference: Visher, Christy A., Adele Harrell, Lisa Newmark, and Jennifer Yahner (2008).  Reducing Intimate Partner Violence: An Evaluation of a Comprehensive Justice System-Community Collaboration.  Criminology and Public Policy, 7(4), 495-423., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV10N31.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-10-no-3-%E2%80%93-april-2009,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 10, No. 3 – April 2009",Regular Issue,2009
Intensive policing of minor disorder in neighbourhoods increases fear.,", “Broken windows policing” has come to mean a form of policing involving crackdowns on signs of disorder (e.g., street prostitution, littered vacant lots, drug trafficking) the purpose of which is to reduce all types of criminal activity.  The theory has been that if “disorder goes untreated, citizens become fearful and withdraw from the community, informal social control decreases and/or is perceived to be low by criminals, [and, as a result of this process] disorder and crime increase as criminals increase their activity in the area” (p. 504, Figure 1)., The effect of this approach on overall crime is not well established (see Criminological Highlights 8(4)#1, 8(5)#8, 5(1)#6).  However, the hypothesized mechanism (reduced fear in the community) is itself important. This paper examines the impact of an intensive crackdown on street drug activity, prostitution, and other forms of street-level disorder, involving motor vehicle stops, sting operations, and generally a large increase in police presence in very small target areas., In this study, some block-long street segments were subject to intensive policing and some were not.  In addition, researchers systematically recorded signs of social disorder (e.g., people loitering, loud disputes, noticeably drunk people, homeless people) and physical disorder (abandoned buildings, graffiti, litter).  Residents were interviewed and were asked about their own perceptions of disorder.  The main dependent variable was the residents’ report of how safe they felt walking alone outside at night on their block.  In addition, actual measures of reported crime were recorded as well as characteristics of the respondents.  The analysis also controlled for residents’ pre-intervention levels of fear., The results showed that “those living in areas that received the extra police presence were more fearful than those in other areas, controlling for levels of crime, disorder and [pre-intervention levels of fear] and various other factors [e.g., demographic characteristics of the respondents]” (p. 508).   Clearly, these results suggest that ‘broken windows’ approaches to policing of troubled neighbourhoods cannot be justified by the suggestion that people in those neighbourhoods will feel more comfortable., Dividing respondents into those who felt either ‘safe’ or ‘unsafe’ walking on their own block at night, it was clear that disorder itself had a large impact.  Most (72%) of those living on the most disordered streets reported feeling unsafe, compared to only 15% of those who lived on the least disordered streets.  But 57% of those who experienced extra police presence felt unsafe as compared to only 29% of those whose streets got no extra police presence during the experiment., Conclusion. Given that extra police presence increased, rather than decreased, fear, it seems unlikely that ‘broken windows policing’ could reduce crime by making the streets feel more inviting for those who are likely to exercise informal social control.  “Seeing a sudden increase in police presence on their block may lead residents to infer that crime has increased and that their block is more dangerous and crime prone than in the past” (p. 509).  “Broken windows policing approaches that are detached from the community and pay little attention to community sentiment may in some sense be doomed to failure” (p. 510)., Reference: Hinkle, Joshua C. and David Weisburd (2008)..

One of the important reasons people support punitive approaches to crime is that they are angry about crime.,", Much of the research on support for punitive responses to crime has focused on information deficits (e.g., lack of information about the effectiveness or the cost of various sanctions or about actual offences or offenders) rather than on people’s emotional responses to crime.  This paper follows earlier suggestions that there is an emotional component to the public’s views of crime policy (see Criminological Highlights 4(3)#1) and that these emotions need to be understood in order to understand the support for policies that otherwise seem ineffective., The focus of this paper is on punitiveness, defined by people’s support for four criminal justice policies:  life imprisonment for those convicted of three felonies, tightening parole release, trying and sentencing as adults juveniles age 14-17 who are charged with violent offences, and support for harsher sentences for violent crimes.  A representative sample of non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black Americans were asked about their views of these policies. In addition, their views on various other matters were assessed: the extent to which they blame individuals (as opposed to circumstances) for crime (e.g., agreement with questions like, “People turn to crime because they are lazy), political conservatism, racial resentment (e.g., agreement with statements like “Most blacks who receive money from welfare programs could get along without it if they tried”). Fear of crime was measured by respondents’ answers to questions about how often they fear having their house broken into or being robbed. Anger about crime was assessed by way of a question which asked “When you think about crime in this country do you feel….” with five response categories going from ‘not angry at all’ to ‘very angry’., Although both fear and anger independently and significantly predicted support for punitive policies, the impact of anger was considerably larger.  In addition, however, political conservatism, the belief that people engaged in crime as a result of individual failings, and racial resentment were all positively related to support for punitive policies. Those who believed that the criminal justice system did not treat blacks and whites equally were less punitive, as were those who had a close friend or relative in prison., Conclusion.  Support for punitive policies appears to be linked to more fundamental beliefs about society and about the origin of crime.  To the extent that support for punitive policies is linked, as well, to simple anger about crime (above and beyond fear), it is clear that debates about policies based on evidence, costs, and effectiveness are, to some extent, irrelevant. For those people who are interested in engaging the public in a discussion about criminal justice policies, “Appealing to both the cognitive and affective nature of attitudes may prove a more successful strategy” (p. 62) than using simple evidence-based arguments., Reference.

"For white male Americans with low levels of education or low income, expecting to be financially less well off next year than this year is associated with support for punitive criminal justice policies.",", Various writers have suggested that, quite independent of actual levels of crime, crime in our society has become more salient than it was in the past.  Not only are most people exposed to numerous reports of crime (and entertainment television involving crime) but politicians in many countries have used crime and crime policy as a way of getting attention and votes. Almost all connections made by politicians between crime and crime policy are in a single direction: punitive crime policies are seen as a solution to the crime problem.  But crime is not equally salient for all people in a community, and not everyone responds by supporting punitive policies.  This paper examines the support for punitive policies by looking at people’s insecurity about crime and their economic insecurity, the hypothesis being that at least for some parts of the population, punishment policies may “provide a ready opportunity for the channelling of anxious insecurities into rage” (p. 28)., Using data from a 1997 representative sample of Florida residents, respondents were asked about support for seven punitive policies (e.g., capital punishment, making prisoners work on chain gangs, harsher sentences, taking away TV and recreational privileges from prisoners).  These formed a single factor of punitiveness. Fear was measured by asking people how much they feared being the victim of each of six crimes. Separate from this, people were asked about their concern about crime. Finally, people were asked “Looking ahead, do you expect that this time next year you will be financially better off than now, or worse off” (p. 32)., Overall, Blacks and those more educated were less punitive. Those who identified themselves as politically conservative (opposing efforts to achieve equality for minorities and women, opposing spending tax money on health care for the poor) and those with high concerns about crime and high fear of being victimized were more likely to support punitive crime policies.  Among whites and males, however, those who thought that next year they would be economically less well off were also more likely to support punitive crime policies.  When the white male sample was examined in detail, it was shown that expecting to be economically worse off next year was associated with punitive attitudes only if the respondent had relatively low income or low education., Conclusion. As various theorists (e.g., David Garland) have suggested, “the perception that life is precarious and fraught with risk and that somehow the State is seen as failing in its efforts to deliver physical and economic security to key groups” (p. 41) may explain some of the support for harsh policies toward those who are seen as being responsible for at least some of this insecurity.  At times when economic insecurity about the future is salient for increased portions of the population, one might expect support for punitive policies to increase., Reference: Costelloe, Michael T., Ted Chiricos, and Marc Gertz (2009).

"New York’s Sex Offender Registration and Notification Law had no impact on reducing sexual re-offending by rapists, child molesters, or other sex offenders.",", Special laws requiring the registration of those in the community who have a history of sex offending and/or notification of citizens of their presence in the neighbourhood are based on the false assumption that recidivism rates of sex offenders are especially high (e.g., Criminological Highlights, 6(6)#8, 5(1)#4, 8(3)#8, 6(3)3, 9(2)#5).  Previous studies (e.g., Criminological Highlights 4(1)#2) have suggested that these laws are unlikely to have any impact on crime, just as restrictions on where sex offenders can live are likely to be ineffective or counterproductive (e.g., Criminological Highlights, 7(4)#4, 5(6)#1, 8(6)#5).  This study examines the impact, on those who had been convicted of sex offences, of New York’s Sex Offender Registration Act which requires registration and community notification of convicted sex offenders who live in the community., New York’s law requires sex offenders to register, and, for those deemed to pose more serious risks, it requires some form of community notification.  This study analyzed monthly arrest data for a 21 year period  – 10 years before the law came into effect in January 1996 and 11 years after.  The simple hypothesis would be that if the law kept people from being victimized, there should be a reduction in the criminal involvement of those who were subject to registration after the law came into effect. For a number of different offences (for this 21 year period) the number of arrests of those previously convicted of a (registration-required) sex offence and the number of arrests of those without a previous sex offence conviction were examined., The results for total registerable sex offences (all offences that required registration under the 1996 law) are typical of all findings.  There was no significant impact on total arrests of the registration law.  Furthermore, there was no impact on the number of arrests for those who had previously committed sex offences or on the number of first time arrests for sex offending.  The data demonstrate, however, an important limitation on any attempt to reduce sex offending which focuses its attention on those who have a record of sex offences. Approximately 96% of those arrested for registerable sex offences throughout the 21 year period did not have a record that included any registerable sex offence.  When smaller groupings of sex offences were examined results were very similar: There was no apparent impact of the law on rape or child molestations.  The number of repeat rape or child molestation arrests did not change when the law came into effect and in about 95% of all cases, the person arrested had no record of a previous registerable sex offences., Conclusion. One of the main reasons that sex offence registries and community notification schemes do not have any impact is that the recidivism rate for sex offenders is not remarkably high.  Most sex offences, it appears, are committed by those who have not previously been convicted of a sex offence.  “Because registration and community notification laws were based on false assumptions regarding sex offenders and sexual offences, attention and resources are diverted from those most common types of sex offences – those committed by first-time sex offenders and those who have a pre-established relationship with the victim – to ones perpetrated by the stereotypical sex offender” (p. 298)., Reference:  Sandler, Jeffrey C., Naomi J.

"Youths who spend a lot of time “just hanging out with friends” are especially likely to be involved with various forms of crime, as are youths with higher incomes and better access to automobiles.",", Previous research has found that unstructured socializing (or in normal language ‘just hanging out’) with friends is associated, for youths, with increased levels of delinquency.  If being with friends (in the absence of adults) provides youths with opportunities to get in trouble, it could also be argued that other factors that affect opportunities to offend might have similar effects. This paper looks at the effect of income and access to private transportation (automobiles) on delinquency. The theory is that each of these factors “can be expected to increase delinquency by facilitating the ease of such behaviour and movement away from authority figures” (p. 8)., Data were collected from 17,890 youths (from 132 schools in the U.S.) who can be considered to be a representative group of school age (Grades 7-12) youths in the U.S. The study focused on four measures of delinquency – violent offending, property offending, heavy alcohol consumption (frequency of consuming 5 or more alcoholic beverages in a row), and marijuana use.  The main independent variables were the frequency that youths reported just hanging out with friends, whether the youth had access to relatively large amounts of money (from work or allowances), and whether the youth had access to an automobile.  Various control variables (age, gender, race, poverty, single parent family) were also included., Across all four measures of delinquency (property and violent crime, high alcohol use and marijuana use), and controlling for various background factors (e.g., age, gender, race, poverty)  youths who spent more time hanging out with other youths were more likely to be involved in each of these forms of delinquency. But in addition, those youths who had access to relatively large amounts of money (from allowances, jobs during the school year, and summer jobs) were more likely to be involved in violent acts, heavy drinking and marijuana use but not property crime.  Those youths who had an automobile they could drive were more likely to be involved in all forms of delinquency.  In addition, those youths who typically had a parent who was at home before and/or after school were less likely to be involved in any of the four types of delinquency., Conclusion. Clearly some forms of advantaged positions in life – operationalized here as having access to money and a car – increase the likelihood of involvement in delinquency perhaps because both money and access to a car provide youths with opportunities for delinquencies that they would not otherwise have.  In addition, opportunities to be delinquent come in other ways: unsupervised time with other youths was associated with property and violent crime as well as heavy drinking and marijuana use. These findings suggest that “Although individual traits clearly matter, it is also important to consider the extent to which the routine activities of youth affect their exposure to opportunities for delinquency” (p. 25)., Reference: Anderson, Amy L. and Lorine A.

Police who shoot civilians may suffer from perceptual distortions that make what they have done appear to be ‘reasonable.’,"Police who shoot civilians are typically judged according to a standard of whether their actions were “objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them” (p. 119). This judgement is meant to be made “from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight” (p. 119).   This would appear to mean that in determining reasonableness, one must make “allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgements… [on] the amount of force that is necessary…” (p. 119)., The challenge, however, is that police officers who have shot civilians may report a number of different types of perceptual distortions that would suggest their reports of ‘what happened’ may be quite different from the perceptions of those who are not directly involved in the incident or those who view video recordings of these incidents., In this study, 80 officers from 19 police forces in four states were interviewed concerning 113 incidents in which they had shot civilians. Six types of temporary distortions were identified: tunnel vision (a narrowing of the visual field), heightened sense of visual detail, diminished or exceptionally loud sound, and the experience of events in ‘slow motion’ or in ‘fast motion.’  Almost all police officers (88% prior to firing, 92% when firing) reported experiencing at least one of these distortions. About a third of officers reported ‘tunnel vision’ before or while firing. Even more (42% prior to firing and 70% when firing) reported ‘auditory blunting.’  The distortions were often reported as having changed between the period prior to shooting and during/after shooting., It would appear that when police officers shoot civilians, they are reasonably likely to report that they did not hear things that others in the vicinity might hear; they report that they did not notice things that were obvious to other observers; and their sense of how long the events took may be likely to be seriously impaired.  How, then, does one judge a police officer’s actions when the situation, according to their reports, appears to have created an inability to assess the situation effectively?, These findings raise a number of important questions (noted in a commentary on the paper). For example, will an officer who is aware of these findings “use a perceptual distortion defence not because he or she experienced [perceptual distortions], but as ‘an out’ for explaining why the pieces of evidence [the officer’s statement and other facts] do not match” (p. 168)?  In focussing on officers who have shot civilians, and linking this behaviour to perceptual distortions, this study raises critical questions about officers who have not shot civilians.  Is there something that allows these non-shooting officers “to avoid a distortion and ultimately make a [different] decision…” (p. 170) as they interact with civilian suspects?  Similarly, one might ask whether there are training processes that might prevent less-than-optimal decisions being made based on perceptual distortions., Conclusion.  Since it appears that most police in this study who shot civilians reported having experienced, at the time of the shooting, at least one form of perceptual distortion, there is a need to determine whether police officers in similar situations who did not shoot civilians experienced similar distortions.  Such findings may help understand police shootings, and might help police forces understand what can be done to minimize the impact of perceptual distortions on the part of police in these very difficult situations., Reference:  Klinger, David A. and Rod K.

Complex psychology-based instruments designed to predict future offending by those released from prison do not generally do better than predictions based on the offender’s criminal record.,", It is well established that “Structured risk-assessment instruments outperform clinical judgement” (p. 337) for most predictions of future offending. Nevertheless, there is relatively little information about how useful complex psychological testing is for predicting future offending, above and beyond the established finding that past offending predicts future offending.  This paper addresses two quite separate issues: Are psychological risk assessment scales better at predicting future behaviour than predictions based on ordinary information that is in every prisoner’s file?  Do these prediction measures also work for women?, This study compared the relative usefulness of the following “psychological” risk measures for predicting future offending:  the Psychopathy Checklist – Revised; the Violence Risk Appraisal Guide; and the Historical, Clinical, Risk Management-20. These can be compared to two different non-psychological or “actuarial” measures that combine simple information about previous offending, age, and sex to make a prediction about future offending and one measure that was simply a count of previous convictions., Data from two quite different samples of offenders in prisons in England & Wales were used.  The sample of men was generated from adult prisoners serving 2 year sentences for a sexual or violent offence. The sample purposefully over-selected those prisoners who were high risk offenders (based largely on criminal record), from ethnic minority groups, or were young.  The sample of women did not involve ‘oversampling.’ Instead, all women who met the basic criteria were included in the study. The sample of women, unlike the sample of men, was representative of those serving 2 year sentences for sexual or violent offences.  Hence comparisons of the levels of accuracy of the predictions for men with the predictions for women are inappropriate. Recidivism was defined as a reconviction during a follow-up period lasting an average of about two years., Looking first at the measures for men that were used to predict violent re-offending or any offending, the three “actuarial” measures of risk of re-offending were very similar in their predictive validity to the three clinical scales.  For women, the two types of measures (psychological and actuarial) were very similar in their predictive validity when predicting ‘any’ offending.  However, the predictive validity of the more psychological measures appeared to be slightly better than the “actuarial” measures for predicting future violent offending for women., Generally speaking, it appeared that all of the measures predicted future violent, acquisitive, or ‘any’ offending for both men and women.  In this study, the predictions of future offending for men appear to be slightly better than for women, but these small differences could have been the result of the different sampling methods., Conclusion. Comparing various psychological approaches to the prediction of future offending to more actuarial approaches for men would suggest that the actuarial predictions are generally as effective or more effective in predicting future offending generally. Actuarial predictions are obviously much easier to obtain, and can be computer generated from official criminal record information, age, and sex of the offender. For women, however, the more psychological measures may be slightly better for predicting violent, but not other, offending.  But the argument that all of these measures, largely developed with data only from men, have no predictive validity for women is clearly wrong., Reference:  Coid, Jeremy, Min Yang, Simone Ullrich, Tianqiang Zhang, Steve Sizmur, Colin Roberts, David P.

"If crime spikes, ordinary citizens want something to happen but when there’s no obvious quick fix for the crime problem, new laws may be created to make it look as if something effective is being done -- even when these laws criminalize ‘doing nothing’.",", In the summer of 1991, Chicago residents were faced with unusual amounts of crime.  There were 927 homicides in Chicago (population 2.8 million) that year.  (In comparison, Toronto, with a population of 2.3 million, had 89 homicides).  A variety of explanations can be offered for the apparent surge in violence in Chicago that year, but ‘gangs’ appeared to be a central feature of much of it. Lacking ideas about what to do about the violence, and because there did not appear to be any serious anti-social behaviour that had been left un-criminalized, the Chicago City Council decided to go after gang members, rather than gang-related behaviour: they made it an offence for any actual or apparent gang member to do nothing while in a public place, or, in legal language “to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose” (p. 132).  Not surprisingly (even to many of its supporters) the ordinance was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court 7 years later, but not before roughly 42,000 people had been arrested and another 43,000 orders to disperse had been issued by the police to those whose only offence was ‘doing nothing’ in public., The question remains, however, why the law was enacted in the first place, and what it was meant to accomplish.  Careful analyses of its effects suggested that, if anything, enforcement led to increased, rather than decreased, crime.  Its origins, however, cannot be understood by looking at its effects. Instead, it is suggested that “faced with a perceived failure of existing systems to manage risks” (p. 133) and with general frustration with the law, legislators feel the need to respond to demands for security and to re-establish their authority by the enactment of laws which, in effect, criminalize the threat that people experience., Public hearings were held in Chicago on the proposed law. These appeared to be explicitly designed, as the city’s lawyer put it, to “establish whether there is a legitimate, regulatory interest in addressing what seems at first thought to be perfectly proper conduct: people standing on the public way” (p. 137).  Furthermore, by responding to a threat with a new law, the ordinance responded to citizens’ concern that the law serve their needs (rather than, for example, placing limits on the intrusiveness of police actions). The spike in crime was seen as a failure on the part of government. Thus the view that “something [needs] to be done to curb gang activity” (p. 138) was a dominant force in the development of the ordinance. Those pressing for the new law suggested that there was a ‘gap in the law,’ that the police have ‘no legal authority,’ (p. 140),  and addressing this gap – by giving the police the right to criminalize ‘doing nothing’ – would help solve the problem.  Ironically, law generally was seen as part of the problem and more law was seen as the solution to this problem., Conclusion. A “breakdown in trust in state authorities” (p. 141) along with heightened feelings of insecurity led Chicago City Council to reassert state authority by criminalizing ‘apparently doing nothing’ even though it was known to be on uncertain constitutional terrain.  “Residents and aldermen alike are drawn to laws’ promise: they may be deeply invested in having the tools they believe are necessary to play the legal game, but they also make appeals to fundamental legal concepts of rights and liberties in framing their aspirations. It is in many ways remarkable that – despite the violence and turmoil residents were experiencing – normative appeals to law and legality persisted as the framework for seeking well-being and security” (p. 146)., Reference: Levi, Ron (2009).

The manner in which school grades are divided between elementary and middle schools makes a difference: Placing Grade 6 students in middle schools rather than in elementary schools increases the likelihood of various forms of infractions in school and interferes with their school performance.,", The configuration of schools in the United States has changed over the past 40 years. In 1971, more than 75% of Grade 6 children attended elementary school.  By 2000, Grade 6 had been promoted into middle school, and over 75% of Grade 6 students were in schools that included Grades 6-8 but not elementary school grades.  Grade 6 students, therefore, have shifted from being the oldest students in elementary schools to the youngest children in middle school.  This paper examines the impact of this shift in school structure on misbehaviour in school and school performance., There are reasons to suspect that this change could affect the behaviour of Grade 6 students.  Peer group influences are known to be important in early adolescence. If Grade 6 students are especially vulnerable to peer influences as they move into adolescence, placing them in schools with older youths may mean that they are more likely to be influenced by the behaviours of older youths (e.g.,  engaging in  various offences).  On the other hand, if Grade 6 is spent in an elementary institution, these students may avoid negative influences at a particularly vulnerable time., School records of students in North Carolina who spent Grade 6 in either an elementary school or a middle school were examined for various forms of disciplinary infractions reported by the schools to state authorities.  In addition, end-of-grade standardized test scores were examined.  Although these two groups of students were relatively similar, it appeared that after entering Grade 6, students in middle schools were more likely to have recorded infractions of any kind or a violent or drug infraction than students in primary schools.  There is some evidence that this was not a reporting difference (i.e., that middle schools report more infractions than elementary schools).  Children in Grade 9 who had attended Grade 6 in a middle school were more likely to have infractions in Grade 9 than were children who attended Grade 6 in an elementary school.  In addition, the end-of-grade standardized reading scores for children who attended Grade 6 in a middle school tended to be lower than the reading scores for children who had attended Grade 6 in an elementary school. Interestingly, however, their math scores did not vary., Conclusion.  For an average child in a North Carolina Grade 6 class who is in an elementary school, the probability of an infraction being registered is about 16%. This increases to 29% for a child whose Grade 6 is in a middle school.  “Middle school brings sixth graders into routine contact with older adolescents who are likely to be a bad influence” (p. 118).  These data are consistent with findings that placing Grade 6 students in middle schools is likely to reduce ‘on time’ rates of graduation from high school.  “Moving sixth grade out of elementary school appears to have had substantial costs” (p. 118).   Although this paper focused solely on school-based measures,  it serves as a reminder of the importance of school factors as an influence on children’s offending (e.g.,  Criminological Highlights, V4N2#4, V4N5#5,  V9N4#3,  V10N2#1)., Reference:  Cook, Philip J, Robert MacCoun, Clara Muschkin, and Jacob Vigdor (2008).

Clinicians vary enormously in the likelihood that they will find an accused person competent to stand trial.,", Accused people are often referred for assessments of their competence to stand trial (CST).  Though in some locations, specialized forensic evaluators do the assessments, often ordinary clinicians in psychiatric hospitals are involved in this process. Though courts are not required to follow the advice of those who carry out the assessments, it appears that they usually do.  Ideally, of course, the CST assessment should be influenced solely by the characteristics of the accused, not the clinician.  On the other hand, given that there are few objective criteria of what it means to be competent to stand trial, it would not be surprising if clinicians varied considerably in where they placed the threshold for CST., Reviews of the literature on CST assessments suggest that rates of “incompetence to stand trial” vary, across clinicians, from about 1% found incompetent to about 77%.  Obviously some of this variation may be a result of different referral practices.  Studies of CST assessments carried out by clinicians working in the same forensic clinics, or by similarly trained raters using structured measures of CST, suggest that there is sometimes very high agreement between clinicians. It would appear that clinicians working together in the same setting have generally arrived at common standards of what CST means. On the other hand, a study of 273 board-certified forensic psychologists and psychiatrists responding to two vignettes of defendants referred for competence evaluations showed very little agreement. In one case, the assessments were evenly split with about half of the assessors describing the defendant as competent and the other half as not competent., In this study, records from 55 clinicians in Virginia and 5 psychologists in Alabama, all of whom had training and experience doing competency assessments were assessed.  The proportion of cases found incompetent to stand trial by a given clinician varied from 0% to 62%.  For those who had done at least 100 assessments, the proportions found incompetent to stand trial varied from 4% to 28%.  Obviously some of the variation could be due to other factors (e.g., who requested the evaluation, differences in the patients, etc.).  It appeared, in the Virginia data, that there were some systematic differences across professions with social workers being most likely to find the defendant incompetent, psychiatrists least likely to see the defendant as incompetent to stand trial, and psychologists in the middle.  But in addition, above and beyond other identifiable characteristics of the cases, there appeared to be individual differences in the threshold for a finding of CST., A separate analysis was carried out on the CST judgments made concerning defendants diagnosed as psychotic.  Two clinicians found very few of these (0% and 5%) to be incompetent to stand trial.  The rate of findings of incompetence for the other clinicians ranged from 26% to 60%. Hence, even within this diagnostic category, there was rather dramatic variability., Conclusion.  It would appear that who does the evaluation of competence to stand trial makes a substantial difference to the outcome. To the extent that ‘competence’ is a continuum, it is possible that clinicians are simply drawing the line between competence and incompetence at different points.  Alternatively, different assessors may be looking at somewhat different factors in their assessments.  Whatever the reasons are, however, it would appear to be very likely that the recommendation from a clinician as to whether or not a defendant is competent will depend at least in part on the identity of the clinician., Reference.

Early antisocial behaviour on the part of young children – a ‘risk’ factor for later problems – can be affected by early family/parent training programs.,", There is a fair amount of research suggesting that intervention in the first few years of a child’s life can have a lasting impact measurable by reductions in crime (see, for example, Criminological Highlights V4N2#1, V6N5#2, V2N4#7).  The theory is that early family/parent training programs will help the child learn control over “impulsive, oppositional, and aggressive behaviour thus reducing disruptive behaviour and its long-term negative impact on social integration” (p. 3)., “While early family/ parent training may not often be implemented with the expressed aim of preventing antisocial behaviour, delinquency, and crime… its relevance to the prevention of crime has been suggested in developmentally–based criminological and psychological literatures” (p. 4).  This review examined 55 independent evaluations of family/ parent training programs, all of which included a randomized controlled design with children five years or younger., Typically the training programs involved “either individual or group-based parent training sessions… conducted in a clinic, school, or some other community-based site” (p. 55). One of three standardized programs was typically the focus of the training, the most common one being the “Incredible Years Parenting Program.”  This program was designed to “provide parent training to strengthen the parent’s competencies in monitoring and appropriately disciplining their child’s behaviours along with increasing the parent’s overall involvement in the child’s school experiences to promote the child’s social and emotional competence and reduce their conduct problems” (p. 55).  Another program was designed “to introduce and train parents to use positive and nonviolent techniques when trying to manage their child’s behaviour” (p. 56).  Studies varied on the source of the outcome measures (ratings of the child’s behaviour).  In some cases, teachers rated the children. In other studies reports of the child’s behaviour from parents were used. In others, researchers made direct observations of the children in various settings.  Some studies used multiple sources of information.  Most of the studies (38 of the 55) were American, the remainder having been carried out in one of 6 different countries., There appeared to be an overall benefit of these highly structured training programs whether the data were based on observations of the parents, researchers, or teachers.  Given that all of the studies involved randomized experiments, it is safe to conclude that these training programs were effective in causing a reduction in antisocial behaviour by young children., Conclusion.  The findings provide clear evidence that “early family/ parent training can assist parents and families in preventing antisocial and delinquent behaviour by providing them with the tools necessary to engage in effective child-rearing” (p. 89).  This is not to imply that any training of parents will help.  These programs tended to be extensively tested and documented and were implemented effectively.  “It is also important to note… that parenting programs have also been shown to have other non-crime/ behaviour benefits as well such as increasing educational attainment, reducing teenage pregnancy, improving economic well-being, and promoting health….” (p. 89).  These programs are typically implemented for large numbers of ‘at risk’ parents. For example, the Quebec government spends $70 million each year “to support disadvantaged mothers in improving their parenting skills and increasing their access and use of parent services” (p. 89)., Reference: Piquero, Alex R., David P.

"When ‘pop psychology’ invades the criminal justice system, justice suffers: The evidence of ‘repressed memory’ of traumatic events in childhood does not stand up to scientific scrutiny.",", The notion that brutal childhood events can be repressed completely out of consciousness and later recovered through intensive psychotherapy appears to be held by a large proportion of jurors, judges and police officers.  Evidence of “recovered” memories of previously “repressed” events has frequently been received and accepted in court cases in which sexual assault (often by caregivers) has been alleged. However, scientific evidence does not support the idea that people commonly become unable to remember harrowing events, and then, after a period of amnesia, ‘recover’ the memory., Repressed memory cases imply an inability to recall that a traumatic event even occurred, not that people prefer not to think about an event or in which certain details are forgotten. Nor does it refer to events that occurred before a child had the ability to remember it in the first place. Many courts have become more sceptical about repressed and recovered memory because “the notion of massive forgetting of a traumatic experience and the possibility of later video-camera-type recall is not part of any existing psychoanalytic theory of memory” (p. 229).  The scientific evidence suggests that “traumatic events – those experienced as overwhelmingly terrifying at the time of their occurrence – are highly memorable and seldom, if ever, forgotten” (p. 231)., Retrospective studies – in which there is no evidence other than the “recovered memory” of the existence of the event – “form the overwhelming majority of investigations cited as proof of repression” (p. 233).  Some of the cases of possible abuse that have been cited as evidence of repressed memory – involving fondling, sleeping nude with children, etc. – may demonstrate simple forgetting of events that were neither traumatic nor memorable even at the time. In other highly cited cases, independent investigations have determined that there was no evidence that memories were ever repressed and that discussions about the allegations had occurred during the period when the memories were supposedly ‘repressed.’   In other studies of cases of documented severe abuse, the evidence demonstrates that skilled and sympathetic questioning of victims brings out the evidence of the abuse.  It would seem that “the better a study’s methods, the less likely it is to find evidence of missing memory for trauma” (p. 235).  “An exhaustive literature search focusing on more than 10,000 survivors of severe, specific, historically documented traumatic events did not find even one person who developed amnesia for the trauma” (p. 235). “Studies examining children’s recall of sexual mistreatment show that such experiences… are typically recalled well” (p. 235)., Finally, a number of experiments have shown that questioning of ordinary people can induce ‘memories’ of events that never occurred.  In one experiment, people were asked to reminisce about childhood events, three of which were real events that had been provided to the researcher by a family member, and one of which was false (getting lost in a shopping mall as a child).  By the end of the study, 25% of the participants in the study “remembered at least some details about the episode” (p. 152) – an event that did not actually occur. “Research using a variety of techniques now demonstrates that we can implant a range of false memories in subjects” (p. 153)., Conclusion.  “The available research repeatedly demonstrates that memories of traumatic events appear to follow the same laws as do those of more mundane events. In both kinds of memories, details fade as time passes; both kinds of memories are subject to interference from later experiences; and both can be systematically distorted over time” (p. 237).  “Psychological research gives no reason to believe that the productions called recovered memories necessarily or invariably represent accurate descriptions of childhood experiences” (p. 237-8)., Reference: Piper, August, Linda Lillevik and Roxanne Kritzer (2008).  What’s Wrong with Believing in Repression?

Should Corporal Punishment of Children be Criminalized?,", Starting with Sweden in 1979, 23 countries have instituted universal bans on the corporal punishment of children – defined as “causing the child to experience bodily pain so as to correct or punish the child’s behaviour” (p. 232).  Corporal punishment of children has been a controversial topic in many countries.  This paper examines the evidence and arguments on this controversial topic., Surveys in the U.S. suggest that some form of physical punishment of very young children is quite common (e.g., one survey of 1000 parents suggests that 63% used physical punishments on 1- and 2-year-olds (p. 232).  At the same time, however, “the research to date indicates that physical punishment does not promote long-term, internalized compliance” (p. 234).  And the majority of studies in western countries suggest that corporal punishment is associated with more, not less, aggressive behaviour on the part of the child, but part of this relationship may be the result of the characteristics of parents who use corporal punishment and the severity of the punishment itself (see, for example,  Criminological Highlights, 4(1)#3)., In addition, children with more behaviour problems elicit more corporal punishment from their parents than do more well behaved children.  Nevertheless, concern has been expressed that there may be other negative impacts on children (e.g., eroded parent-child relationships, mental health problems, later violent behaviour). Not surprisingly, in this context, parents who use corporal punishment are more likely than other parents to physically injure their children., In 2007, 49 of 50 states in the U.S. permitted corporal punishment by parents and 22 allowed corporal punishment in schools. In Canada, the Criminal Code states that “Every schoolteacher, parent or person standing in the place of a parent is justified in using force by way of correction toward a pupil or child, as the case may be, who is under his care, if the force does not exceed what is reasonable under the circumstances” (s. 43). However, the Supreme Court of Canada placed certain restrictions on its use (e.g., age, severity of the punishment).  Most of the 23 countries with bans on all forms of corporal punishment (either through legislation or court decisions) have policies that suggest prosecutorial restraint in prosecuting those suspected of using corporal punishment.  In some countries, there have been advertising campaigns to try to bring awareness of the bans on corporal punishment, though it is not clear how effective they have been., Conclusion. The difficulty with a ban on corporal punishment is clear: it would, in effect, criminalize behaviour that is being engaged in by the vast majority of parents. Studies done in this decade suggest that by the time they reach Grade 5, most (80%) American children had been corporally punished by their parents, and about half reported being hit by a belt or other such object.  Criminalization, then, could put large numbers of people (i.e., most parents) at risk of prosecution for behaviour that is not currently seen as being criminal.  As one set of commentators has noted, “The customs and laws of a society should be given due respect and consideration before banning or stigmatizing a practice, such as physical punishment, that most members practice and consider useful in accomplishing their goals….” (p. 261).   On the other hand, some have suggested that a ban on corporal punishment would give a clear message about what is unacceptable within a community., Reference: Gershoff, Elizabeth T. and Susan H. Bitensky. (2007).

"Prisoners paroled after Hurricane Katrina destroyed their neighbourhoods in New Orleans, Louisiana (USA) were forced to live elsewhere. As a result, they were less likely to be involved in crime.","Generally speaking, prisoners who are released on parole return to their former neighbourhoods and released prisoners tend to be concentrated in certain neighbourhoods.  At the same time research would suggest that “to decrease the probability of recidivism, it would be beneficial to separate parolees from their criminal past and their peers” (p. 487).   For certain prisoners, Hurricane Katrina – which destroyed large parts of New Orleans in 2005 – ensured that offenders could not return to their former neighbourhoods., This study looked at prisoners who came from neighbourhoods in New Orleans that were badly damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.  Re-incarceration for a new offence or for a parole violation within one year of release was examined for prisoners released in September to February 2001-2 and 2003-4 (prior to the hurricane) and in 2005-6 (after the hurricane). Given that prisoners from the most damaged sectors of New Orleans were much less likely to return to their ‘home’ neighbourhoods, the hurricane acted as a natural experiment, testing the effect of returning to a different neighbourhood.  More than twice as many parolees released after Hurricane Katrina were released to new neighbourhoods than had been the case in the years prior to this event., Taking into account the fact that not all post-Katrina parolees moved to new places and that not all pre-Katrina parolees returned to their old neighbourhoods, “individuals who migrated to a different [location] were significantly and substantially less likely to be re-incarcerated within one year of release from prison” (p. 496).  The probability of re-incarceration for male parolees who returned to their old neighbourhoods was .265 whereas those paroled to other neighbourhoods had only a .110 probability of being re-incarcerated within a year.  The same effect was demonstrated when parole revocation or a new criminal conviction was used as the dependent variable. Furthermore, “all parolees, whether first releases or those with multiple prior incarcerations, are significantly less likely to be re-incarcerated if they migrate to a different [neighbourhood]” (p. 497)., Conclusion. Since the data demonstrate that parolees who were forced to change their place of residence were less likely to be reincarcerated (for either a parole violation or a new offence), the next challenge is to determine why this might be the case. One possibility is that “parolees who migrate to… [a new location] may be more likely to sever ties with criminal peers than would parolees who return to… [their old neighbourhoods]” (p. 500).  Other research suggests that moving to a new neighbourhood is desired by almost half of those released from prison.  “While forcing ex-prisoners to move away from their old neighbourhoods is neither realistic nor ethical, providing opportunities for ex-prisoners to move away from old neighbourhoods is a policy prescription that may be worth pursuing” (p. 501)., Reference: Kirk, David S.

Increasing the certainty of punishment for illegal acts can be effective in reducing offending and may generalize to circumstances in which the objective likelihood of apprehension has not changed.,", Governments often look to deterrence as a way to reduce crime.  However, they frequently make the mistake of focusing solely on increasing the amount of the punishment rather than its certainty even though there is substantial evidence that the size of the expected punishment does not matter in determining levels of crime (e.g.,  Criminological Highlights, V6N2#1, V7N3#6, V8N1#2). In contrast, this study looked at the general deterrent impact of certainty of receiving a punishment on law breaking in the Zurich, Switzerland, transit system., In the transit system in Zurich, train passengers are required to carry valid tickets, but, after 1993, there were no regular checks to see whether passengers had valid tickets.  However, infrequent spot checks were carried out throughout the day and evening (which allowed estimates to be made on the proportion of riders who had not purchased tickets).  Punishment for not having a valid ticket was, after December 2003, an on-the-spot fine of the equivalent of about €54 (C$87) escalating to €80 for a third offence., In the early 2000s, a number of surveys carried out for the transit system revealed that many passengers felt unsafe while riding on evening trains, perhaps because transit staff were not regularly on the trains. In mid-2003, in order to address passengers’ sense of insecurity, attendants were brought back onto the trains after 9 p.m. Although they were reintroduced to the trains to provide security to passengers, the attendants were also required to systematically check tickets on the evening trains in the Zurich region. This resulted in about 1 passenger in 3 being checked for valid tickets. No change in the checking of tickets (and hence the objective probability of apprehension) occurred during daytime hours., Fare-dodging (estimated by the number of checks leading to an on-the-spot fine) dropped from about 3.5% of all riders in early 2003 to about 1% by the end of 2005. In January 2006, data were made available separately for those subject to ‘normal’ spot checks (that occurred throughout the day) and for those checked by the train attendant (who worked only in the evening hours). It appears that the increased surveillance during the evening hours generalized to the daytime hours such that fare dodging was equally low during that period, even though there had been no increase in the checking of tickets. The results are corroborated by data from surveys in Zurich schools in 1999 and 2007.  The lifetime prevalence of fare-dodging decreased from 62% to 52% during this time period, a finding that is consistent with the transit system’s data., Conclusion.  It appears that increasing the objective likelihood of apprehension for offending (transit fare dodging in this case) can have an impact as long as people perceive that the probability of being apprehended has increased.  In this case, however, the effect of increased surveillance also generalized to periods of the day when there was no objective change in the probability of apprehension.  It may be that in this case – and perhaps others – people know of the general increase in the likelihood of apprehension either from their own experience or from hearing that others have been apprehended. At the same time, they may have insufficient information to realize that the increased surveillance and apprehension was limited to specific times of the day., Reference: Killias, Martin, David Scheidegger, and Peter Nordenson (2009).

Youths in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods in a city are especially likely to spend time with older youths. These older youths are not likely to provide positive role models for their younger friends.,", Though it is frequently assumed that the neighbourhood in which a youth lives is important in understanding that youth’s behaviour, relatively little is known about who, in a given neighbourhood is most likely to serve as a role model to a youth. The concern – especially in disadvantaged neighbourhoods – is that youths who have a preponderance of delinquent friends are more likely than others to be delinquent themselves., However, within poor neighbourhoods, there is “strong support for conventional ideals about education, work, welfare, and marriage….” (p. 446).    Nevertheless, it is clear that poor neighbourhoods are heterogeneous, thus providing youths with “multiple cultural models from which to choose” (p. 448). The puzzle, then, is to understand how unconventional cultural models are transmitted to youths in disadvantaged neighbourhoods., In a national survey, youths who were about 16 years old were asked to provide the ages of “people with whom you spend most of your time.”  In the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods, 65% of the youths reported that they spent most of their time with older youths (under 26 years old).  In the least disadvantaged neighbourhoods, only 49% reported that they spent most of their time with youths older than themselves. With these survey findings (which included older siblings in the group of identified individuals) as a starting point, interviews were carried out with adolescent boys aged 13-18 in three predominantly African American neighbourhoods in Boston, two of which had high rates of family poverty and high rates of violence. In the two poor areas, 75% of the youths reported “older men from outside their families as part of their peer networks” (p. 452).  In the less disadvantaged neighbourhoods only 15% reported interacting with older adolescents and young adults outside their families.  In the poor neighbourhoods, helping protect others from violence and being protected by those more able to provide protection went hand in hand and tended to define membership in the community.  This was not the case in the more advantaged neighbourhood in which other more conventional activities were more likely to be the reasons for associating with other youths., Youths from the more disadvantaged neighbourhoods were more likely to spend time in their own neighbourhoods than were youths from the more advantaged neighbourhoods, in part because leaving their neighbourhoods was perceived by the youths from disadvantaged neighbourhoods to put them at risk of altercations with adolescents from other neighbourhoods.  But staying in one’s own territory limits the range of people one can associate with.  Older youths in these areas see it as their duty to protect younger youths – and see it as part of what it means to be part of a community.  In addition, older youths gain status from assuming this community or collective responsibility.  In the more advantaged neighbourhood, there are “fewer idle young men and older adolescents of working age with whom younger adolescents might pass time” (p. 456). They are more likely to be working or otherwise engaged. Perhaps as a result, youths from these neighbourhoods are less likely to be associating with older youths., Conclusion. “Disadvantaged older adolescents and young men are important sources of socialization for boys in poor neighbourhoods, thereby identifying one potential pathway for neighbourhood socialization” (p. 461).  And given that one of the reasons for the connections across age groups is protection, the findings show “how the failure of a community to control violence can have spillover effects in other domains through the impact of violence on the age structure of peer networks” (p. 462)., Reference: Harding, David J.  (2009).

"Young men from poor neighbourhoods who are wanted by the police, often for minor crimes, avoid ordinary events (e.g., the birth of their children) and locations (work, a parent’s home, or hospitals when they are sick or injured) because they fear being apprehended.",", With large numbers of poor Black residents of some American cities under some form of criminal justice control, it is inevitable that a non-trivial number of them would also have warrants out for their arrest – often for violations of those controls (e.g., for failure to appear in court, failure to pay fines, or failure to comply with conditions of release).  The question addressed by this paper is a straightforward one: What is the impact of the threat of being arrested on the everyday behaviour of the ‘wanted person’?  This paper addresses this question based on the author’s six years of fieldwork in poor Black areas of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania., “Once a man finds that he may be stopped by the police and taken into custody, he discovers that people, places, and relations he formerly relied on, and that are integral to maintaining a respectable identity, get redefined as paths to confinement” (p. 344).  For example, one man who drove his partner to the hospital for the birth of their son was arrested by police in the hospital for an offence –  drinking while on parole – that had taken place some time earlier.  The police had come to the hospital for other reasons but had carried out a routine check of the list of visitors to see if there were any visitors who had outstanding warrants.  The result of this episode in the community was that other men with warrants out for similar offences no longer attended the births of their children. Similarly, one man who had been robbed and beaten chose to have his face stitched by a nursing assistant he knew rather than take the chance of going to the hospital for proper medical treatment. His assumption was that hospitals often notify the police of injuries of this sort and he would be arrested for a minor outstanding warrant.  Places of employment similarly become dangerous for people with outstanding warrants since they provide easy locations for police to apprehend people.  One man whose offence was that he did not return to a halfway house “saying that he could not spend another night cooped up with a bunch of men like he was still in jail” was subsequently arrested leaving work and sent to prison for a year for the violation. The workplace clearly was a risky location for these people. Contact with other parts of the legal system – e.g., family court hearings related to maintaining custody of a child – similarly become risky locations for those who might be suspected of violating conditions of a warrant., The other side of the coin is that other members of the community are equally aware of the fact that those with outstanding warrants are unable to claim protection of the law.  Hence, those with warrants were, themselves, vulnerable to violence or robbery because they could not afford to call the police. For some men, the threat to call the police was used as a tool against them to achieve compliance in unrelated matters. The existence of warrants also served as explanations or excuses for not participating in traditional activities (e.g., attending parents’ day at school)., Conclusion. “Once a man is wanted, maintaining a stable routine, being with his partner and family, and using the police may link him to the authorities and lead to his confinement” (p. 351).  Said differently, one of the barriers to a traditional life is the fact that these men cannot afford to take the risk of having traditional relationships. “One strategy for coping with these risks is to avoid dangerous places, people, and interactions entirely” (p. 353).  The situations that are avoided, of course, are often the very same places, people, and interactions that are seen as reflecting the values of traditional society., Reference: Goffman, Alice (2009).

Providing opportunities for ‘at risk’ youths to attend after-school programs is not sufficient to reduce unsupervised time with other adolescents.,", Providing after-school programs for youths who are at risk of offending is sometimes seen as an ‘evidence based’ solution to crime. The assumption is that these programs are designed to reduce unsupervised time with delinquent peers and provide positive role models for these youths.  This study examined the impact of after-school programs on those youths from 5 urban schools (that were underperforming academically) who expressed an interest in participating.  These youths were then randomly assigned to one of two conditions: half the youths were given the opportunity to attend special after-school programs, half were not., The theory that providing after-school programs will reduce crime is based on the assumption that unsupervised time is likely to be associated with offending.  But there are reasons to question whether simply increasing the availability of after-school programs will reduce unstructured socializing.  Specifically, the following facts would imply that after-school programs may not have their desired impact on unsupervised socializing by youths: (a) Participation is voluntary and, as a result,  attendance in the programs is often inconsistent and low.  Data show that the average youth enrolled in these programs attends approximately once a week.  (b) Youths who want to spend unmonitored time with friends can avoid adult monitoring by choosing not to participate in the programs. Those who find the programs attractive may be less likely to offend regardless of the availability of the program.  (c) At-risk youth are more likely to drop out of these programs than those not at risk of offending.  Said differently, these programs may, in the end, provide services largely to youths who don’t need them., Youths in the study were asked to indicate how many weekdays, in a typical week, they spent “hanging out with your friends with no adults present after school” (p. 399).  Although youths who had been assigned to the ‘program group’ were able to attend the after-school program every weekday, it only reduced their unsupervised socializing by about a half day a week. For all participants, the more unsupervised socializing the youths engaged in, the more likely they were to report engaging in one or more illegal acts and using drugs in the past month.  However, the experimental treatment effect – whether the youths were invited to participate in this after-school program – had no impact on delinquency or drug use.  The data suggest that the program did not manage to attract those youths who would be most likely to benefit from it. In fact, both the treatment youths and the control youths (who had asked to participate in the program, but as a result of random assignment did not have the opportunity) were heavily involved in various kinds of organized after-school activities independent of this program.  For these youths – and perhaps many other urban youths – there already are a range of organized activities available away from school., Conclusion. “The goal of reducing the amount of time youth spend with peers away from adult monitoring is an important one, but this study leads to the conclusion that providing after-school programs may not be an efficient method with which to accomplish it…. The data from this study show that students who volunteered for our after school programs were involved in abundant after-school activities other than the [new] after-school program” (p. 406).  The reason for the failure of the after-school program to affect crime and drug use would appear to be simple: those who were at highest risk of offending (perhaps because of unsupervised time with delinquent youths) simply never showed any interest in after-school programs.  Providing an effective-sounding program is not likely to be an effective approach unless the appropriate population of at-risk youths can be persuaded to participate in it., Reference: Cross, Amanda Brown, Denise C.

"Risk of recidivism declines with the number of years since the last conviction.  At some point in time, an ex-offender’s risk of offending becomes indistinguishable from the risk of offending of someone who never offended.",", Two findings, taken together, form the basis of this paper.  First, it is well established that those who have committed offences in the past are more likely than those who haven’t offended to commit offences in the future.  Second, the likelihood of offending drops off with age (see, e.g., Criminological Highlights 6(4)#3).  The question that can be asked is, therefore, whether there is a point in time at which former offenders are no more likely to offend than are non-offenders.  This was recently addressed by another set of authors in two almost identical, but separately published, papers (see Criminological Highlights V8N4#4).  This paper develops this issue further, providing a framework for thinking about the question, “At what point can an ex-offender be considered to have been ‘redeemed’ from his or her criminal past?”, It has been estimated that 7.8% of all American males and 27% of black American males have been incarcerated by the time they are 40 years old (see Criminological Highlights V5N3#7).  Obviously many more have acquired criminal records but were sentenced to something less severe than prison. Given the ubiquity of criminal record checks – studies in the U.S. suggest that between 50% and 80% of large employers require them – a criminal record can have long-term devastating impacts on employment (see Criminological Highlights,V6N3#2)., Using data from New York State concerning those first arrested as adults (age 16 or older in NY) in 1980, models were developed to estimate two points in time: the point at which those offenders who remained crime-free were no more likely to offend than the general population, and the point at which those with a criminal record might be considered to be ‘sufficiently close’ in their likelihood of re-offending to those without any record of offending that the difference is not important. In general, those who were young (age 16) at the time of their first adult arrest maintained a higher likelihood of reoffending than those who were older (age 20) at the time of their first offence. These two groups did not look equivalent (in terms of the likelihood of reoffending) until about 15 crime-free years had passed.  However, the likelihood of reoffending after a given crime-free period varies with offence. For example, those whose first offence was robbery were more likely to reoffend than were those first convicted of burglary or aggravated assault. This difference held for crime-free periods of up to about 11 years., However, those arrested at age 16 for burglary or aggravated assault were indistinguishable from the general population if they managed to remain crime free for a period of about 4.9 years. Those first convicted of robbery at age 16 had a higher likelihood of reoffending than did the general population until 8.5 years had passed since their conviction.  Those arrested for the first time at age 20 became indistinguishable from the general population in their propensity to re-offend within 4 years for robbery and within 3.2 and 3.3 years for burglary and aggravated assault, respectively., When estimating the point at which a former offender has become ‘sufficiently close’ to those who have never offended, one obviously has to decide what ‘sufficiently close’ means.  If, for example, an employer can accept a ‘risk difference’ of  5%, then for property offenders first arrested at age 20, one would only have to wait 4 crime-free years for these offenders to be ‘sufficiently close’ to those who never offended.  However, for those first arrested at age 18 for a violent offence, one would have to wait about 8 crime-free years for these offenders to become ‘sufficiently close.’, Conclusion. Ex-offenders who live crime free lives for a number of years eventually become indistinguishable from the general population and become very similar to those who have never offended (in terms of the likelihood that they will offend). It would make sense, then, to incorporate findings such as these into policies that ensure that these “redeemed” offenders who no longer pose special risks are relieved of the stigma that blocks normal employment and other opportunities., Reference: Blumstein, Alfred and Kiminori Nakamura (2009).

"Under the Anti-Social Behaviour Act, young people in Britain are, in effect, told that ordinary behaviour that would normally be considered acceptable can be deemed unacceptable by the police.  As a result, the government is “criminalizing youth sociability and alienating… young people on the basis of adults’ anxieties…” (p. 23).",", Anti-social behaviour in Britain is now defined so as to include behaviour that is likely to cause harassment, alarm, or distress to others. The law reflects evidence suggesting that about a third of the respondents to the British Crime Survey report that youths hanging around on the street in their neighbourhoods is a ‘big problem.’   Similar to attempts to deal with worried residents in other locations at other times (see Criminological Highlights, V10N4#3), the law gives police the power to disperse two or more people who were in previously designated locations.  If youths fail to disperse as ordered, they become liable to imprisonment and/or a substantial fine. In other words, the law criminalizes the failure to stop doing something which itself is not criminal., The research reported in this paper is based on an examination of police data on orders that have been issued, interviews with police and municipal officials in 13 police force areas, and intensive studies in two study sites which include interviews and focus groups with youths and adults, as well as interviews with various key informants.  Many of the orders (about half in London) were authorized for either city/town centres or in shopping areas suggesting, perhaps, commercial interests in ensuring that adult consumers feel comfortable. In Scotland, none of the initial authorizations were in the most deprived areas, perhaps reflecting greater tolerance among less advantaged adults for groups of young people hanging out on the street., Young people who were interviewed as part of the research often acknowledged that they might look threatening, but at the same time they pointed out that they felt safer when they were with a group of their friends. Some youths thought that the anti-social behaviour laws increased the likelihood that youths would engage in truly troublesome behaviour because they could not hang around areas near their homes simply to meet and talk. Many also noted that they don’t really have alternative places to meet with friends. In that context, some youths pointed out that the dispersal of youths for reasons other than their own behaviour “puts across the message that every young person is delinquent” (p. 13).  One of the perverse effects of the law is that those who comply with it – those who disperse and go home when ordered to do so – become those most adversely affected by it in that their liberties are intruded upon more than those who simply move to a different location not covered by the law.  Youths often saw the law – and the implementation of it – as demonstrating a lack of respect by the police and others for youths. As noted elsewhere (see Criminological Highlights, V8N5#5), negative experiences with police are much more important in shaping views of police than are positive experiences., The ultimate youth dispersal device that is being used in some locations is ‘The Mosquito’ – a device designed to emit high frequency screeching sounds, audible only to young people (roughly age 20 and younger) but not to adults. By using this device, commercial establishments like shopping malls are able to disperse all youths whether or not they are congregating and without the involvement of the police., Conclusion.  At the same time that governments in various countries are, ostensibly, trying to protect children (e.g., by increasing the age at which they can drink, smoke, or leave school), this law criminalizes ordinary legal behaviour of youths because this behaviour makes adults nervous.  The latter message – like negative interactions with police – may be the one that has the greatest impact on youths’ attachment to traditional social values., Reference: Crawford, Adam (2009).  Criminalizing Sociability through Anti-social Behaviour Legislation: Dispersal Powers, Young People, and the Police.  Youth Justice, 9(1), 5-26., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV10N51.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-10-no-5-%E2%80%93september-2009,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 10, No. 5 –September 2009",Regular Issue,2009
Relying on statistical predictions of which individuals will be high rate offenders is not likely to affect the level of crime in a community.,", One often hears statements such as “a group as small as 5-6 percent of offenders accounts for up to 50% of offences” (p. 318).  Such assertions often are used to justify crime control strategies based on predictions of who these high rate offenders are.  There are a number of problems with these assertions.  For one thing, they typically refer only to offences resulting in convictions, and often refer only to offences known to have been carried out by those in prison.  Most importantly the observations in studies cited in support of these sorts of assertions are made retrospectively.  The authors of the present study note: “We have not been able to find a study that could identify a group comprising only a few percent of a cohort at a pre-school age that would then account for half of the cohort’s criminal convictions” (318)., The present study examines the problems inherent in a crime control policy based largely on identifying and intervening with people who are likely to commit criminal offences. For such a policy to be effective, interventions need to reduce dramatically the frequency of future offending for a group of high rate offenders who can be accurately identified.  The first problem is that effective interventions into the lives of youth, on average, reduce the frequency or likelihood of offending by no more than about 10-20%.  In addition, prospective or population studies suggest that crime – even crime leading to convictions – is not highly predictable.  One study, for example, showed that the most ‘at risk’ youths (about 20% of all youths) in a sample of Swedish males who had been convicted of criminal offences were responsible for only about half of the offences committed by the full sample.  Furthermore, only about half of this highly ‘at risk’ group of youths was ever convicted of any offence and only 17% of them could be considered ‘high rate offenders.’  In other words, it does not appear that strategies that might rely on identifying relatively high risk youths and treating them will have an appreciable impact on crime rates., In addition, from data collected in Sweden in the past 90 years, it does not appear that ‘crime’ as recorded by the police varies in parallel to changes in youths’ social circumstances (e.g., serious intra-family conflict, divorce). In contrast, another factor – societal alcohol consumption – appears to be almost the only variable necessary to understand changes in homicide rates. Similarly, variation in the rate of car thefts for most of the 20th century can be explained by changes in automobile ownership, not individual factors subject to therapeutic intervention., Conclusion.  The suggestion that interventions at the individual level (e.g., efforts to reduce individual drug abuse) will not have a substantial impact on crime rates in a community is not to say that they are unimportant. Rather this paper suggests only that individual interventions are not likely to turn a high crime society into a low crime society.  For example, in one collection of studies it was noted that “the predictors [of lethal violence] based on early life conditions are… strikingly similar [in the United States and in the U.K]” (p. 331).  Nevertheless, homicide rates in these two countries are quite different. “An explanation for crime and trends in crime over time cannot be provided without taking into consideration history and the broader context, including variations in situational factors and in the societal response to undesired behaviours” (p. 332)., Reference: Tham, Henrik and Hanns von Hofer (2009).

"Serious juvenile offenders who are ordered to serve time in juvenile institutions are just as likely to reoffend as are comparable youths who remain in the community.  Furthermore, longer stays in juvenile institutions do not reduce subsequent offending.","Although many political leaders suggest that communities would be safer if serious juvenile offenders were placed in institutions for long periods of time, they typically make such suggestions in the absence of empirical support.  Most systematic studies of the issue are much less optimistic. If long stays are not effective, then it logically follows that crime prevention policies based on the removal of youths from the community should be revisited.  This paper examines the effect of the removal of serious juvenile offenders from the community, using a sample of 921 youths in two locations in the United States., About half of this sample of youths was placed on probation; the other half was sent to an institutional placement.  The unusual strength of this study was that 66 separate variables were used to control, statistically, the differences between those youth placed in institutions and those placed on probation. These same variables were used to control for differences between youths who received institutional placements of different lengths.  Not surprisingly, many of these variables showed differences between those placed in institutions vs. probation and between those who received long vs. short stays, underlining the importance of controlling for the differences., Two measures of subsequent offending were used: the re-arrest rate during a follow-up period of 48 months and the self-reported offending rate – the number of different types of offences (out of 22 serious antisocial and illegal behaviours) that the youth engaged in during the 4-year follow-up, corrected for the amount of time that the youth was actually in the community.   These two measures were, not surprisingly, moderately (r = .47), but by no means perfectly, correlated., Given that there were background differences between those youths placed in institutions and those who remained in the community, there were differences in subsequent offending rates for the two groups, absent of any controls.  Those placed in the community were about half as likely to be rearrested as those placed in institutions.  The more appropriate test of the impact of institutional placement, however, is one that takes into account the differences between the groups.  After controlling for the background differences between the two groups, there were no significant differences between the two groups on re-arrest rate.  Said differently, “the results show no marginal gain from placement in terms of averting future offending” (p. 722).  Similar effects were found for self-report offending., When looking at the effects of the length of institutional placement (taking into account the various control factors), there was, once again, “no marginal benefit, at least in terms of reducing the future rate of offending [re-arrest and self-report offending], for retaining an individual in institutional placement longer” (p. 723)., Conclusion. This study of relatively serious young offenders suggests that a strategy of placing youths in custodial settings – and holding them there for long periods of time – is not likely to reduce future offending.   The latter finding – that the effect is unrelated to the “dose” of the “treatment” – suggests that, in this case, more is not likely to be better., Reference: Loughran, Thomas A., Edward P.

Placing prisoners in higher levels of security than necessary leads to higher rates of recidivism upon release.,", There is some published evidence that assignment of prisoners to high security institutions increases the likelihood of misbehaviour and of recidivism compared to inmates with the same classification scores who are assigned to lower security institutions.  However, these studies typically suffer from the possibility that there are unmeasured factors that are responsible both for the placement in higher security levels and to higher rates of misbehaviour in prison or recidivism after release.  In contrast, this paper reports recidivism data for set of prisoners who, in effect, were assigned to either a high or a low security prison on a truly random basis, eliminating the possibility of differences in recidivism being the result of pre-existing conditions., For a 6 month period in the late 1990s, California experimented with a new method of classifying inmates.  During this period, all prisoners were classified using two different instruments – the one that had been in use for some time and a new one. Those 561 prisoners for whom the 2 classification systems produced different results were randomly assigned to either a low or a medium-high security prison., These two groups of prisoners “exhibited equivalent levels of total and serious misconduct during their institutional confinement” (p. 153).   After release, however, differences emerged. The re-committal of prisoners to the California prison system between their release date and September 2006 constituted the main outcome variable.  The average risk period was 5.9 years.  Notwithstanding the random assignment, the higher security prisoners did tend to spend less time in prison.  Hence ‘time at risk of recidivism’ needed to be controlled for.  Using a ‘survival’ analysis (whether or not the inmate was still in the community and, therefore, had not been returned to prison), it was clear that the low security prisoners were likely to remain longer in the community without being returned to prison. “Prisoners who had been assigned to a [medium-high] security prison began failing at a higher rate upon release and continued to do so until about 1000 days after release from prison” (p. 151)., Obviously, one limitation of this study is that it could only be carried out with those prisoners who received different classification results on the ‘old’ and ‘new’ classification instruments.  We do not know, therefore, if the results would generalize to all prisoners.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to know exactly why the prisoners sent to the medium-high security prisons were more likely to reoffend than were the prisoners who spent their prison time in minimum security.  Whether the risk of recidivism was influenced by peer and/or environmental factors is, therefore, not answered by this study., Conclusion. Given that prisoners assigned to high levels of security in prison are more likely to re-offend when released, it would appear that “By separating inmates into homogeneous risk pools, prison administrators are inadvertently increasing the likelihood that [certain] inmates will be recommitted to prisons” (p. 153).  This criminogenic effect of high security, however, does not manifest itself until after release.  Though the mechanism for the effect may not be clear, what is clear is that there may be important public safety consequences of unnecessarily restrictive prisoner classification., Reference: Gaes, Gerald G. and Scott D.

The fact that youths are capable of knowing ‘right from wrong’ and that they are capable of making informed and intelligent decisions about medical treatment does not justify treating youths as adults.,", Many jurisdictions have created different minimum age limits for different activities.  For example, youths can be sentenced to life in prison at age 14 in Canada, but cannot legally purchase cigarettes in some provinces until they are 19. The American Psychological Association argued before the U.S. Supreme Court that adolescent girls should have the right to make their own decisions on terminating an unwanted pregnancy, but also argued before the same body that youths should not be subject to the death penalty because of their immaturity.  These two positions were seen as contradictory by one of the US Supreme Court justices who voted in favour of the position that youths should be eligible for the death penalty.  This paper presents evidence that the positions are not contradictory and, in fact, reflect different forms of maturity., The main reason that these positions are not contradictory is rather simple: they are referring to different types of skills. It can be shown that youths are less mature than adults on dimensions that are relevant for determining culpability for criminal acts but are able to make difficult decisions involving personal and social values., Making basic medical decisions relates to “abilities that permit logical reasoning about moral, social, and interpersonal matters…” (p.586). Offending, however, is different. Youths are not the same as adults when such “capacities as impulse control and resistance to peer influence” (p. 586) are important in a decision.   The evidence suggests that most youths make decisions about terminating pregnancies in a manner that is carefully considered and not rushed. Typically these decisions are made with adult advice (though not necessarily advice from a parent). Crimes, however, are often a result of impulsive and unplanned decisions., A large multi-site study of 935 people age 10-30 examined the relationship of age to cognitive and psychosocial abilities.  Various standard measures of cognitive skills were used. In assessing psychosocial maturity, the investigators employed measures of whether respondents saw potentially dangerous or harmful activities as risky.  They also assessed sensation seeking, impulsivity, ability to resist peer influence, and future orientation., Between age 10 and age 15, psychosocial maturity did not increase.  Only at about age 16 did youths begin to achieve maturity on this dimension. Interestingly, increases in psychosocial maturity continued up to age 30.  A general measure of cognitive capacity, on the other hand, increased from age 10 to age 16, but then levelled off thereafter.  Studies of competence to stand trial show the same general relationship with age as other cognitive abilities. Thus one can be reasonably confident in concluding that “adolescents reach adult levels in cognitive maturity several years before they reach adult levels of psychosocial maturity” (p. 592)., Conclusion.  Given that cognitive abilities appear to be ‘adult-like’ relatively early in life (i.e., by the time a youth reaches age 16) and matters such as sensation seeking and the ability to resist the influence of peers only begin to become more adult like at age 16, it makes sense to think of these abilities as being different.  In deciding, then, whether youths in mid-to-late adolescence should be treated as adults, one has to determine what the relevant dimension is that controls the behaviour., Reference: Steinberg, Laurence, Elizabeth Cauffman, Jennifer Wollard, Sandra Graham, and Marie Banich (2009).  Are Adolescents Less Mature Than Adults?

"When a youth’s best friend is more delinquent than he or she is, the youth will become more delinquent over time. But if the youth’s best friend is less delinquent, the youth will become less delinquent over time.",", There is an extensive research literature in criminology that suggests that youths whose friends are delinquent are more likely, themselves, to be delinquent, than are youths whose friends are not delinquent.   The implication is simple: if a youth is not involved in delinquency, then the youth should be kept away from delinquent youths.  But is the influence only in one direction?  This paper examines the hypothesis that the influence works, in fact, in both directions., In a large multi-site study, youths in grades 7 to 12 in 16 schools were asked to indicate which of 13 deviant acts they engaged in. These included offences such as damage to property, thefts, selling drugs, as well as other forms of misbehaviour such as running away from home, lying to parents/guardians, and taking part in a fight involving a group of youths. They were also asked to identify their best same-sex friend.  About a year later, they were asked, again, to identify their best same-sex friend. They also completed, again, the same measure of deviance.  Because all youths in 16 schools were asked to fill out the questionnaires, the researchers had a high probability of being able to match youths with their best friends and to compare their levels of offending.  
 
Between the two measurement periods, youths’ delinquency rates tended to move in the direction of their best friend.   Overall, about a quarter of the youths did not change their overall delinquency rates during the year.  However, for those whose best friend’s delinquency was lower than their own, 28% became more delinquent and 66% became less delinquent in the interval between the two waves of data collection.  For those youths whose best friend had a higher delinquency score than they did, about equal proportions increased, stayed the same, or decreased in their delinquency scores., Youths whose best friends’ delinquency rates increased during the interval between the two data collections (either because the friend’s level of delinquency changed, or because the youth changed best friends) tended, themselves,  to increase their own levels of delinquency, and those whose best friends’ delinquency rates decreased tended to decrease their own level of delinquency.   Whether or not the youth changed best friends in the intervening period of time did not appear to make any difference to their changes in rates of delinquencies., Stability of friendship appeared to be unrelated to the similarity of the delinquency levels of the youth and his or her best friend.  In addition, there was only a weak relationship between the youth’s delinquency level and the best friend’s level., Conclusion.  It appears from these data that the delinquency levels of best friends are likely to become more similar over time.  At the same time, friends whose delinquency rates are different from one another are just as likely to remain friends as are youths whose delinquency levels are different.   However, just as exposure to delinquent peers is an important factor in predicting delinquency, these data remind us that having non-delinquent peers reduces subsequent delinquency., Reference: McGloin, Jean Marie (2009).  Delinquency Balance: Revisiting Peer Influence. Criminology, 47 (2) 439-477., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV10N61.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-10-no-6-%E2%80%93-december-2009,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 10, No. 6 – December 2009",Regular Issue,2009
Using “risk” as the basis of criminal justice decisions can be risky: Such decisions may turn out to be less accurate than anticipated and may undermine other important principles.,", Risk assessments have been used in criminal justice decision-making for decades.  Judges and other criminal justice decision-makers sometimes think that they can predict – using their own intuition or the ostensibly sophisticated prediction instruments developed by others – whether an individual will re-offend.  Parole authorities are often, in legislation, required to take into account the likelihood that a prisoner will re-offend.  In a similar way, “actuarial risk assessment is now promoted as best practice in child welfare…” (p. 3)., Risk factors have now been divided into two types: static (largely factors relating to an offender’s past) and dynamic (factors subject to change).  Furthermore, in part because of the focus on dynamic factors in predictions, “criminological needs” have also become important. The growth of ‘evidence-based practice’ in predictions has encouraged reliance on a simple measure of effectiveness: does a measure predict future offending?  If the answer is “yes”, then often the investigation of the validity of an instrument ceases.  Similarly, the validity of the measure is seldom described in terms of the proportion of false positives and false negatives that result from using the scale., Some scales include components that do not on their own predict reoffending. The difficulty is that if individual components of the measures do not predict future offending – as is the case with some components of the LSI-R (Level of Service Inventory – Revised) scale –  one runs the very real risk of classifying an individual on the basis of factors that do not have any predictive value even if the overall measure does predict. The result could be that a person’s liberty is restricted as a result of a characteristic that has no relationship to future offending. Furthermore, when risks that are not demonstrably related to recidivism are included in overall risk measures, it is inevitable that the measures will not be effective in classifying offenders., Even when the best possible measures are used, there is substantial error.  In one study of the LSI-R, 42% of those classified in the highest risk category among Pennsylvania parolees did not reoffend.  An ‘improved’ version of this scale reduced the false positive error rate to 31%.  However, only 25% of those who did subsequently reoffend were identified as being high risk.  Similar findings (with high false positive and false negative rates) are easy to find in other studies.  Though the relationship between the ‘risk’ measures and ‘recidivism’ are almost always positive and ‘statistically significant’, there are inevitably high proportions of those who score as ‘high risk’ but do not reoffend. It is rare that a high proportion of recidivists are identified correctly by these scales.   In many cases, the problem is that there are large numbers of ‘moderate risk’ offenders whose recidivism is, in effect, unpredictable., Scale constructors in this area, remarkably, often focus on the internal consistency of the measures.  In risk assessment, however, “it is best when all risk items are totally independent of each other but each has a relatively strong relationship to the outcome measure utilized” (p. 6).  These conditions rarely occur in risk scales., Conclusion.  It is inevitable that there will be high proportions of those who are predicted to re-offend by these prediction scales who in fact do not subsequently offend.  Conversely, there are high numbers of those who re-offend who were not predicted to do so. Hence it is important to question whether the criminal justice system should base important decisions on perceived risk. If prediction of human behaviour is inherently flawed, perhaps we should revert to other principles – especially in the allocation of punishment. Instead of trying to use the criminal justice system to predict future offending, punishment could be allocated largely on the basis of what an offender has done, rather than what someone thinks he or she might do in the future.

The importance of independent evaluations of crime prevention programs is evident from the fact that programs evaluated by their developers tend to show more positive effects than evaluations carried out by independent evaluators.,", In recent years, there is increasing evidence that crime prevention studies conducted by ‘developers-as-evaluators’ are much more likely to show positive effects than similar studies conducted by independent evaluators.  There are two possible reasons for these effects.  First it is possible that “the implementation quality is better in studies in which the program developer is responsible for the implementation” (p. 164).  If this were true, there would still be a serious problem: the findings would suggest that positive impacts of the program could be expected only if there is a highly motivated implementation team that was able to keep up its enthusiasm indefinitely.  The second possible explanation for the finding that programs evaluated by their developers show more positive effects is that results obtained by the developer of a program may be systematically biased (e.g., by focusing on positive effects rather than negative effects)., Concern about the latter explanation is of course not limited to crime prevention studies. Similar concerns have been expressed in other areas (e.g., drug effectiveness studies).  But in criminology, the problems are serious, given that evaluations are often carried out by the developer of a program.  These problems need not involve blatant dishonesty.  Instead they can involve such matters as “selective reporting on positive results, ignoring problems associated with differential attrition [from the treatment programs], post-hoc definition of the analyzed dataset, inconsistent ad-hoc definitions of the dependent variables and the unwarranted use of one-tailed significance tests” [a relaxed standard for interpreting whether or not positive effects were found]” p. 167., Some of the programs evaluated by their developers have been declared ‘model programs.’ In the case of one parent training program, 43 studies that looked at child problem behaviour as an outcome variable showed quite strong effects. However, a program in 55 schools implemented by the commercial group that developed the program but that was evaluated independently found no positive impacts.  Similarly, a highly publicized anti-bullying program (the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program) that is distributed in the U.S. reports on its website findings from four studies in which the evaluation was conducted by the program developer.  These four studies show positive effects.  A fifth study, carried out in 12 schools in Philadelphia and evaluated by an independent evaluator shows no positive effects., These findings – positive effects by program developers and no positive effects when evaluated independently – need not involve data falsification. Instead, evaluators with an interest in the outcome may “pay more attention to evidence that supports the conclusion that they would like to reach [and may be] inclined to disregard information that contradicts their views” (p. 172).  In addition, of course, various inadequate design characteristics – such as inadequate comparison groups, post-hoc exclusion of outliers or other cases that tend to disconfirm the hypothesis, selective sub-group analysis – may account for the differences., Conclusion. Results that do not generalize to circumstances in which a program is evaluated by an independent research team clearly can have harmful consequences.  They tend to drive scarce resources into programs that may be ineffective. In addition, to the extent that inadequate evaluations lead to contradictory results, policy makers and the public could understandably become sceptical of any research.  The lesson is clear: those wanting to implement crime prevention programs must look carefully not only at the quality of the research supporting the effectiveness of a program but also at the relationship of the evaluator to the program itself., Reference: Eisner, Manuel.

Cities in the U.S. that had the highest increases in the number of new immigrants during the 1990s showed the largest decreases in violent crime during the same period.,", Immigrants in many countries are often blamed for apparently high rates of crime. Most research, on the other hand, suggests that first-generation immigrants typically tend to have lower crime rates than the average of the communities in which they settle (e.g., Criminological Highlights V8N6#5).  In recent years, immigrants have tended to settle in a wide range of locations in the U.S., unlike earlier periods when they tended to settle in ‘gateway’ cities. Hence, immigration could well be having a widespread impact on crime in the United States., This paper looks at changes in crime rates in 103 metropolitan areas in the U.S. during the period 1994-2004. It models crime rates as a function of changes in the residential concentration of immigrants and Latinos, holding constant (statistically) a large number of other factors known to be related to crime rates (racial composition, age structure, educational attainment, family structure, etc.).  The challenge, in terms of analysis, was to use a technique that took into account the fact that, in general, violent crime decreased during this period of time, and the percent of immigrants in these metropolitan areas increased.  For that reason, relative change in violent crime rates was the focus of the study rather than absolute violent crime rates., The results were consistent across measures of the overall violent crime rate, the robbery rate, and the aggravated assault rate.  Increases in the concentration of immigrants were associated with decreases in these indicators of violent crime. There was, however, no consistent impact of immigration on rape or homicide rates.  It could be argued that one of the explanations for a reduction in crime, generally, in the U.S. during this period was the increase in immigration.  However, “the overall role of immigration for the crime decline is modest, accounting for just over 6 percent of the observed crime drop” (p. 907).  At the same time, these effects should not be ignored: the effect, for the cities with the highest changes in immigrant populations translate into 40.5 fewer violent crimes per hundred thousand people in the general population., Conclusion.  It would appear that the increase in the concentration of immigrants in large U.S. cities and the decline in crime rate are likely to be causally linked.   This effect is consistent with studies elsewhere, but is at odds with popular stereotypes of immigrants being prone to committing crime.   Why this effect occurs, however, is not answered by this study., Reference: Stowell, Jacob I., Steven R. Messner, Kelly F. McGeever, and Lawrence E.

Asking potential jurors to reflect on how their ability to judge evidence in a case might be influenced by the race of a defendant is a more effective way of dealing with potential racial prejudice of jurors than simply asking them whether they would be affected by the race of the defendant.,", Concern about the possibility that a defendant’s race might influence decision-making by juries has led, in Canada, to jurors being asked whether their ability to judge the evidence would be influenced by the defendant’s race.  The problem with this approach is that it assumes that potential jurors are aware of how they would respond to particular situations and will screen themselves out of the jury.
 
Another approach to the potential impact of a defendant’s race is to encourage jurors to consider the possibility that racial prejudice might bias their judgement.  The result might be that this instruction would “orient them toward the process of correction rather than a simple denial of prejudice” (p. 322).   This study examines the effectiveness of the Canadian approach to filtering out prejudiced jurors – simply asking them if they would be affected by the defendant’s race. It compares this approach to one in which potential jurors are asked to consider how their judgments might be affected by the fact that the defendant was black., Non-Black Canadian university students were asked to respond to one of two trial scenarios: a drug trafficking case and an embezzlement case (the former being chosen because it was assumed to be a stereotypic Black crime).  For half of the respondents, the defendant was described as being Black; for the others, he was described as being White.  One group simply read the case without any initial questioning concerning possible bias (the ‘no challenge’ group). Other respondents who received the cases involving the Black defendant were asked to answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to a version of the standard Canadian screening question – whether their “ability to judge the case without bias, prejudice, or sympathy would be affected by the fact that the person charged is Black”(p. 323). Another group was asked a more reflective question: “How might your ability to judge the evidence in the case be affected by the fact that the defendant is Black?” This group was then asked whether their ability to judge would be affected by the defendant’s race., Similar proportions of people in the two cases (15%-18%) indicated that the defendant’s race would affect their judgment. However, they were not more likely to judge Black defendants guilty than were those who did not admit prejudice., The main dependent variable was a scale combining the verdict and the respondent’s confidence in the verdict (i.e., running from “very confident of guilt” to “very confident that the defendant is not guilty”).  There was clear evidence of an effect of race of the defendant.  In the conditions in which there was no questioning about possible bias (the ‘no challenge’ group)  those who received the cases in which the defendant was described as being Black were more likely to indicate that the defendant was guilty than were those who read cases in which the accused was described as being White.  However, respondents who were asked to reflect on how the Black defendant’s race might affect their judgements were less likely than the ‘no challenge’ group to see the Black defendant as guilty and were similar in their ratings of guilt to those who assessed the guilt of a White defendant.  The condition in which respondents were simply asked whether they might be biased did not differ from the ‘no challenge’ condition with the Black defendant.  In other words, the suggestion that the respondents reflect on how the defendant’s race might affect their judgement were significantly affected by this instruction such that the race of the defendant no longer had an effect., Conclusion.  The standard Canadian question asking potential jurors whether they were prejudiced against the defendant did not reduce the impact of the defendant’s race.  These effects were unaffected by the case being judged. It appears that there may be effective ways to counteract potential prejudice among jurors.  Asking potential jurors to consider how race might affect their verdicts appears to have a beneficial impact, though the exact mechanism of this effect is not known., Reference: Schuller, Regina A., Veronica Kazoleas, and Kerry Kawakami.  (2009).

Labelling someone a ‘convicted felon’ increases the likelihood of recidivism.,"Traditionally, labelling theory has suggested that the deeper a person is processed by the criminal justice system (i.e., from police contact to arrest, conviction, or imprisonment) the more likely it is that this person will acquire the identity of ‘offender’ and or experience structural impediments to conventional life.  Some jurisdictions such as Florida allow courts to avoid labelling offenders as ‘convicted felons’ simply by finding them guilty, sentencing them to probation and avoiding labelling them as having been convicted.  An equivalent outcome in Canada would be a sentence of a conditional discharge with probation.  Labelling theory would suggest that those people who successfully avoided the label ‘convicted felon’ would be less likely to re-offend. There is a substantial history of findings suggesting that at least for some offenders, being labelled “offender” increases recidivism.  For example, a study of drinking driving found that for first offenders, a formal conviction appeared to increase recidivism by about 12%., In this study, the recidivism rates for almost 96,000 property, drug, and violent offenders in 67 counties in Florida were examined.  About 40% of them received a formal conviction; the others were not labelled as convicted felons, but were given a probation sentence. Various characteristics of offenders were controlled statistically. Higher rates of recidivism were associated with being male, younger, a property or drug offender rather than a violent offender, having a history of violating a condition of supervision, having a more substantial criminal record, and being black. Above and beyond these effects, however, those who had been labelled as convicted offenders were more likely to reoffend within two years than were those who were found guilty but did not have a ‘conviction’ entered into their records.  This effect appears to hold true for men and women, Hispanics, blacks, and whites, and those with and without a prior criminal record., Conclusion.  It appears that being found guilty and convicted of a felony “significantly and substantially increases the likelihood of recidivism in comparison with those who have had adjudication [conviction] withheld” (p. 570).   This finding is strongest for those who appear to have a strong stake in conformity to society’s values: those who are over 30 years old and have not yet been found guilty of an offence.  One might conclude that “minimizing harm at the individual [offender] level has consequences for reducing harm [in the form of re-offending] in the broader community” (p. 571)., Reference.  Chiricos, Ted, Kelle Barrick, and William Bales (2007).  The labeling of convicted felons and its consequences for recidivism.  Criminology, 45 (3), 547-581., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV9N3.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-9-no-3-%E2%80%93-february-2008,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 9, No. 3 – February 2008",Regular Issue,2008
"Mandatory minimum sentences aren’t really mandatory unless prosecutors wish to impose them.  The decision to impose a mandatory minimum sentence is affected by factors that normally affect most sentences (e.g., the nature of the offence, the criminal record of the accused) as well as sex and race.",", From a prosecutor’s perspective, legislation that imposes mandatory minimum sentences on an accused can be a source of direct sentencing power.  In some jurisdictions – such as Pennsylvania, the location of this study – prosecutors decide whether or not to charge an accused with an offence that carries a mandatory minimum sentence. In addition, prosecutors can effectively decide whether to apply the law requiring a mandatory minimum sentence. Research by the U.S. Sentencing Commission suggests that only about half of those convicted of offences which made them eligible for mandatory minimum sentences actually received them – a process common enough that it has come to be known as “de-mandatorizing.”  From the accused person’s perspective, de-mandatorizing a case has the advantage of avoiding the mandatory minimum sentence, whereas from the prosecutor’s perspective de-mandatorizing can assure certainty of conviction and some punishment., This study identified cases in Pennsylvania (between 1998-2000) that were eligible to receive mandatory minimum sentences. Most were drug cases, though some were second and third ‘three strikes’ cases in which mandatory minimums were ‘required.’ Though there were some differences across these two types of cases, the findings were reasonably consistent.  The ‘overall’ (full sample) findings are reported here. Only 18% of these cases actually had mandatory minimum sentences imposed.  Those who were young, and those who went to trial (as compared to pleading guilty) were more likely to have the mandatory minimum applied, as were those with a prior criminal record, and those charged with more serious or multiple offences., Americans of Hispanic origins, especially young Hispanic males, were also more likely to receive mandatory minimum sentences. Blacks, overall, were not significantly more likely to receive a mandatory sentence.  However, looking across counties in the state, in those counties in which there was a substantial proportion of Black residents, Blacks were much more likely to receive a mandatory minimum sentence. In contrast, in those counties with few black residents, there were no real differences in the likelihood of ‘mandatorizing’ a case for white and black offenders.   It was suggested that “prosecutors might [be] differentially [applying] mandatories in counties with larger minority populations to assuage White fear of minority crime and to be seen as protecting the community from offenders the majority public perceives to be dangerous” (p. 436)., Conclusion.  Legislators may believe that when they pass mandatory minimum penalty laws those who are given the responsibility of enforcing these laws will ensure that these mandatory minimums are imposed.  This clearly is not the case.  Prosecutors, who in many jurisdictions determine whether a mandatory minimum is imposed, focus in the first instance on the factors that normally determine the sentence: e.g., offence seriousness, criminal record, and whether or not the offender pleaded guilty.  But they also use other factors, including race, age, and sex, to determine whether someone is deserving of a mandatory minimum sentence., Reference.

"The relationship between serious mental illness and crime is largely, but not completely, a result of the fact that those with serious mental illnesses are likely to abuse alcohol or other drugs.",", It is well known that a high proportion of those in prison have a history of mental illness.  For example, the Correctional Service of Canada reports that 10% of those admitted to its penitentiaries have a mental health diagnosis on admission and 29% of females and 15% of male offenders had spent time in a psychiatric ward or hospital prior to their admission to penitentiary. The Los Angeles County jail system might be considered to be one of the largest psychiatric facilities in the country, given that about 3300 of its 21,000 detainees require daily mental health services. In the same vein, the second and third largest psychiatric facilities in the U.S. are also jails (Cook County Jail in Chicago and Rikers Island Jail in New York).  One possible explanation for the high involvement of those with serious mental illnesses (SMI) in prison systems is the high rate of co-occurring drug and alcohol abuse in this group., As part of a large survey of American adults (n=73,579 adults), respondents were asked a number of questions which have been shown to be reasonably effective at identifying those who, were they to be given a full assessment, would be found to have a SMI.  They were also questioned about alcohol and drug abuse.  Among those who reported being arrested in the year prior to the survey, 34% reported abuse or dependence on alcohol, and 20% reported use of one or more illegal drugs.  For those who had not been arrested, the corresponding rates were 6% and 2%, respectively.   Those who had been arrested in the previous year were much more likely than those who had not been arrested to report experiencing any serious mental illness (18% vs. 8% on one measure; 11% vs. 5% on another measure)., Controlling for various demographic variables (age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, employment, etc.), the presence of almost any SMI predicted alcohol or drug abuse or dependence.  Each of the eight categories of SMI, except for post-traumatic stress disorder also predicted whether the respondent had been arrested for a violent offence in the previous year.  However, when alcohol or drug abuse/dependence was controlled for, the strength of the association between SMI and violent offending decreased substantially. For some psychiatric diagnoses, controlling for substance abuse/dependence reduced the relationship between SMI and being arrested for a violent offence to insignificance. “Most of the increase in the odds of an arrest for a violent offence among those with an SMI can be accounted for by substance use and abuse” (p. 593).   The simple relationship between SMI and property crime was quite similar:  Most SMIs were related to property offending when substance use was not controlled for.  For property offending, however, as soon as substance abuse or dependence was controlled for, there was no longer a significant relationship between SMI and arrest for any property offence., Conclusion. For property offending, it would appear that the relationship of SMI to arrest is completely a result of substance use. “For violent offences, however, the association between SMI and arrest… cannot be [completely] attributed to drug use” (p. 596). It is suggested that “reducing the criminal justice involvement of individuals with SMI seems to be contingent, in large measure, on properly assessing and treating co-occurring substance use disorders” (p. 598)., Reference: Swartz, James A. and Arthur J.

"When people are optimistic about their financial well-being, and people anticipate good economic times ahead, property crime and robbery rates are likely to decline.",", The relationship between economic conditions and crime is both obvious and elusive. “A generation of research on the impact of unemployment on crime has produced mixed results and has led some researchers to question the validity of the unemployment rate as an indicator of the full range of economic conditions that may influence crime rates” (p. 736).   It is for this reason that some researchers (see, for example, Criminological Highlights, 8(2)#8) have suggested that it is not unemployment per se that is important. Rather, they have suggested that it is the strength of the overall economy that is an important determinant of crime rates., This paper examines the impact on acquisitive crime of the ‘Index of Consumer Sentiment’ (ICS) – a measure of respondents’ “perceptions of change in their financial situation during the previous year and expected change over the next 12 months” (p. 740).  The ICS has been assessed in each of four regions in the United States over a period of 34 years (1970-2003). The relationship of this measure to four crimes (Robbery, Burglary, Motor Vehicle Theft, and other Theft) was examined.  The ICS was assessed with five questions such as “Would you say that you [and your family] are better off or worse off than you were a year ago?” and “Looking ahead, which would you say is more likely – that in the country as a whole we’ll have continuous good times during the next five years or so, or that we will have period of widespread unemployment or depression, or what?”, The findings are fairly consistent:  When people in a region are optimistic about their financial situation, all four acquisitive crime rates that were measured tend to show decreases.  A subsequent analysis suggests that this effect is not a result of high or escalating crime rates leading people to worry about general economic conditions.  These relationships – between consumer sentiment and crime – hold even when the unemployment rate and the gross domestic product (GDP) are held constant statistically.  GDP and unemployment each had statistically significant relationships with some of the crime rates.  However, the results of additional analyses suggest that “part of the effect of GDP on robbery, burglary, and larceny is a function of the relationship between GDP and consumer sentiment.”  Said differently, when the economy is, in fact, going down, people become less optimistic and, in these circumstances, crime rates tend to increase., Conclusion.  Collective economic perceptions and attitudes – or more specifically economic confidence and optimism – had an influence on robbery and property crime rates during the period 1970-2003. Furthermore, it is estimated that a substantial amount of the ‘crime drop’ of the 1990s can be attributed to improving consumer sentiment. These effects appear to be somewhat independent of normal economic indicators (unemployment and gross domestic product)., Reference: Rosenfeld, Richard and Robert Fornango (2007).  The Impact of Economic Conditions on Robbery and Property Crime: The Role of Consumer Sentiment.  Criminology, 45 (4), 735-769., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV9N3.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-9-no-3-%E2%80%93-february-2008,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 9, No. 3 – February 2008",Regular Issue,2008
Japan’s homicide rate dropped 70% in the last 50 years largely as a result of a dramatic drop in the rate of homicides by young males.,", A high violence or homicide rate among young males is often thought to be ‘universal’ across cultures.  John Braithwaite, in his now classic book Crime, Shame and Reintegration (1989) listed as the first two “facts a theory of crime ought to fit” the findings that “Crime is committed disproportionately  by males” and “Crime is perpetrated disproportionately by 15-25 year olds” (p. 44-45).  Similarly, Gottfredson and Hirshi (1990) in their book A General Theory of Crime suggest that “The effect of age [on crime] is everywhere and at all times the same” (quoted, p. 150)., Japan’s homicide rate currently is dramatically lower than that of almost every country for which data are available. This was not always the case. Between 1885 and 1931, the rate (including attempts) fluctuated between about 2.5 and 4.5 per 100,000 people. It was in this same range immediately after World War II.   However, beginning in 1955, the rate began a steady decline, stabilizing at around 1.0 in 1990. Canada’s homicide rate, in contrast, increased sharply in the 1960s until the mid-1970s when it hit about 3 per 100,000. Since then it has drifted downward to its current rate of about 2 per 100,000 residents., Japan’s decline is not the result of general changes in homicide rates across all age groups. It is largely a result of the decline in murders committed by young men.  In 1955, it is estimated that there were about 23 murders per 100,000 men aged 20-24.  Since 1990, the corresponding rate is about 2.0 per 100,000 men of this age.   “Japanese males not only commit fewer murders than youth in other countries, they kill far less frequently than their predecessors did in previous decades” (p. 150).  It is men in their 40s and 50s who are most likely to kill.  Generally speaking, however, Japan’s homicides are distributed rather equally across offenders between the ages of 18 and 60.   This is completely different from the age distribution of homicide offenders in most western countries., Japan is not, however, unique in the world.  In South Korea, people in their 30s and 40s account for more homicides than do people in their 20s. Indeed, of those South Korean offenders whose age is known, 32% were in their 30s and an additional 35% were in their 40s compared to only 14% who were in their 20s.  In contrast, looking at those offenders whose ages were known in the U.S., only 18% were in their 30s and 12% were in their 40s compared to 43% who were in their 20s. Homicide offenders and victims in Russia also tend to be older than in other industrialized nations, Conclusion.  Japan’s homicide rate dropped dramatically in the past 50 years largely because of a dramatic decrease in homicide by young males.   Nevertheless the “Japanese media and government officials often depict the nation’s youth as morally vacuous ‘monsters in the house’.”  Furthermore, “commentators increasingly claim that youth are a root cause of [Japan’s] purported ‘law and order collapse’” (p. 152).  The reasons for the differences between Japan and most other countries are not clear.  It does not seem to be due to the economy since homicide rates have not increased since Japan’s economic problems began in 1990.  And, more importantly, this explanation – like others that have been offered for Japan’s overall low homicide rate – does not account for the unusual age distribution of homicide.  In the end, understanding the difference between the rate and distribution of homicides in Japan and those of most western countries may help us understand the nature of homicide more generally., Reference: Johnson, David T. (2008).  The Homicide Drop in Postwar Japan.  Homicide Studies, 12 (1), 146-160., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV9N3.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-9-no-3-%E2%80%93-february-2008,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 9, No. 3 – February 2008",Regular Issue,2008
A volunteer community-based program for sex offenders reduces re-offending.,", Although sex offenders do not have unusually high recidivism rates (see Criminological Highlights, 9(2)#5, 8(3)#8, 6(6)#8, 6(3)#3, 5(1)#4, 3(3)#3), and, when they do re-offend are likely to commit offences other than sex offences, the belief that they are extremely likely to reoffend has led to a number of special procedures aimed at reducing further offending. Circles of Support and Accountability (COSA) is one such approach used in parts of Ontario, Canada.  The program focuses on individual sex offenders who are released from penitentiary at the end of their sentences (i.e., who are not released on parole and not released under normal ‘statutory release’ at the 2/3 point in their sentences).  The offender ‘voluntarily’ agrees to meet regularly with a group (or circle)  of 4-7 trained volunteers and often meet individually with members of the ‘circle’ outside these sessions.   The group provides support and attempts to help the offender follow a written set of rules. The group also provides help with issues that arise as the offender re-enters society.  The Correctional Service of Canada indicates on its website that the work of the circles is supported by “community agencies, treatment providers like psychologists, sometimes parole or probation officers, the police, and the courts.” Courts have often imposed ‘peace bonds’ on the offenders with various restrictive conditions., This study compared recidivism rates of 60 offenders who had participated in this program with a matched set of 60 sex offenders (matched on the best available measure of the likelihood of recidivism) released at more or less the same time.  Both groups were detained until the end of their sentences, indicating that in the opinion of both the correctional and parole authorities, they had high likelihood of re-offending. The matching also ensured that members of the two groups had received similar treatment while in penitentiary.  The only pre-existing differences between the groups were that members of the COSA group had victimized more people, and were less likely to have victimized only women and on one of the measures of predicted recidivism were predicted to be slightly more likely to re-offend.   The follow-up period averaged about 4.5 years for the two groups.  Sexual and other violent recidivism was defined as being charged with any offence. In addition, any form of offending (including breaching a condition of a ‘peace bond’ if the offender was subject to such an order) was measured., Only 5% of the COSA group was charged with committing a sexual offence during the follow-up period, a rate that was significantly lower than that of the comparison group (17%).  The offences of the three COSA group members who were charged were “qualitatively less severe or invasive than the offence for which they had most recently served a sentence” (p. 332).  This was not true for the comparison group.  Their offences were just as serious as the offences that resulted in their initial incarceration.  Similarly, the rate of violent (including sexual) recidivism for the COSA group (15%) was less than half the violent recidivism rate of the comparison group (35%). 
 Conclusion. The Circles of Support and Accountability project is highly structured. Volunteers are trained; a detailed manual exists; and there are clear rules about how supervision is to take place. Within this context, therefore, it is reasonably clear that the program can reduce sexual and violent re-offending dramatically when its outcomes are compared to a comparable group of offenders who were not offered the program.  Though the program results appear to suggest that the program is effective, it is not perfect: some re-offending still occurs. From a policy perspective, however, it is important to place this decreased rate of re-offending in its proper comparative context., Reference:  Wilson, Robin J., Janice E. Picheca, and Michelle Prinzo.

The War on Drugs in the United States was lost on the battlefield.  But it did have a dramatic impact on the operation of the criminal justice system.,", The American War on Drugs, which began in 1982, was successful on one dimension: the number of drug arrests in the U.S. increased from about 581,000 in 1980 to 1.8 million in 2005. In 2005, most of these arrests (81%) were for simple possession of drugs, and most (43%) of all drug offences involved marijuana.  Surveys indicated that drug use in the U.S. had begun to decline prior to the beginning of the War on Drugs, and by 1991 these levels had declined by more than half.  Nevertheless, drug arrests – increasingly marijuana possession arrests (see, for example, Criminological Highlights, 8(5)#8) – continued to increase. There is no evidence that the ‘war’ reduced drug consumption at all., One problem with a program that targets ‘soft’ drugs such as marijuana is that resources used in an attempt to suppress the use of these drugs use might be better employed elsewhere.  In Illinois, for example, between 1984 and 1989, drug arrests increased by 47%, and impaired driving arrests decreased by 23%. The most dramatic shift, of course, is in the use of prison resources. In 1980, 6% of state prison inmates and 25% of federal prison inmates were there for drug offences.  By 2003, these percents had increased to 20% for state prisons and 55% for federal prisons. Overall, the number people in jails and prisons serving for drug offences increased from about 41,000 in 1980 to about 494,000 in 2003. The proportion of women who are in prison for drug offences is higher than the proportion of men who are in prison for these offences.  Obviously, most of these drug offenders were not important importers or suppliers of drugs., The focus on drugs has had additional unfortunate effects: many other Americans are in prison for drug related offences.  Most state prison inmates in 2004, for example, had used drugs in the month prior to their arrest, and about one in six reported committing an offence to obtain money to purchase drugs.  A decreasing proportion of state prison inmates who had used drugs in the month prior to their offence received drug treatment in prison (37% in 1991; 14% in 2004), perhaps as a result of the fact that basic incarceration costs for the various states have increased so much that funds are not available for treatment. The figures for federal inmates were about the same (34% in 1991 and only 15% in 2004).  These are particularly important findings given that drug treatment has been shown to be cost effective (see Criminological Highlights, 1(6)#7)., African-Americans appear to be particularly likely to be casualties of the War on Drugs.  Surveys suggest that they constitute about 13% of the American population and about 14% of those who use drugs at least once a month.  However at the beginning of this decade, 37% of the drug arrests and 56% of those incarcerated for a drug offence were African American. About a third of crack cocaine users are apparently African-Americans, but 82% of those sentenced in federal court for crack cocaine are African Americans., Conclusion. One of the many problems with the drug war is that it has focused largely on small ‘buy and bust’ law enforcement operations. Such approaches may constitute an efficient way of filling prisons, but these operations do little to stem the flow or use of drugs. In addition, they can have devastating impacts on the communities in which these operations take place. Perhaps as a result of the lack of effect of the war on the use and supply of drugs, other approaches to drugs have begun to gain some support.  Sentencing systems, including the United States Sentencing Commission’s tough guideline sentence for crack cocaine have begun to be loosened in their application or reduced. Drug courts are becoming very popular.  “These legislative developments represent an acknowledgement that the past strategy [focusing on] enforcement has failed to stem the tide of drug abuse, while creating unsustainable growth in the correctional system” (p. 26)., Reference: Mauer, Marc and Ryan S.

"The reasons for gang membership amongst early adolescents vary with the race or ethnicity of the youth.  Interventions aimed at reducing gang membership should, therefore, take into account why young people are in those gangs.",", Although gang membership is not exclusively the domain of racial and ethnic minorities (see, for example, Criminological Highlights, 8(6)#3), there are data from a number of studies that suggest that minority group youths are more likely than others to be involved in gang-related activity.  In this study of 4,997 youths in Grade 8 who had been in schools in which a gang resistance education program had taken place the previous year in “11 geographically and demographically diverse sites across the U.S.” (p. 607), 4.8% of whites reported being in gangs, compared to 8.7% of African-Americans, and 10.5% of Hispanics., It has been suggested that the special attraction of gangs to minority group members could be, in part, a response to marginalization of these youths. Marginalization can occur in various ways. In particular, it is suggested that social and economic conditions “disrupt social control institutions, such as family, schools, and law enforcement. [Then] a street subculture [which] fills the void left by these eroded institutions precipitates street socialization and pushes some adolescents into gangs” (p. 604)., Although respondents in this study were asked if they had ‘ever’ been in a gang, the findings reported here relate only to whether a youth was in a gang at the time the data were collected. In addition, respondents were classified as being in a gang only if they also indicated that the gang was involved in one or more illegal activities., Consistent with findings from other studies, those who were male, African-American or Hispanic, and those who lived in a single parent family were more likely to be gang members.  The predictors of gang membership, however, varied somewhat across groups.  For Whites, those most likely to be gang members were those whose parents had relatively low levels of education, who indicated that they felt lonely (at school, or with their family or friends) and who indicated that they didn’t feel it important to obey the law (e.g., they agreed with such statements as “It is okay to steal something if that’s the only way you could ever get it”) (p. 610)., For African Americans and Hispanics, the predictors of gang membership for youths aged 13-15 were somewhat different. For African-Americans, those who were most likely to be gang members were those youths who had the following characteristics: youths who felt alienated from school (e.g., youths who felt that school was a waste of time and didn’t feel that it provided them with a future); youths who thought the police were unfair, dishonest, and/or prejudiced; youths who didn’t think it important to obey the law; and who youths hung out with friends in locations where drugs and alcohol were available. The predictors of current gang membership for Hispanic youths were relatively similar to those for African-American youths., Conclusion.  In general, factors related to feelings of marginality were important in predicting whether 13-15 year old youths were involved in gangs.  Clearly, however, the factors that predict whether a youth is a member of a gang at a given point in time depend, to some extent, on the race/ethnic background of the youth. Hence it is important to consider race/ethnicity when crafting programs that might be used to reduce involvement in gangs that are involved in illegal activities., Reference: Freng, Adrienne and Finn-Aage Esbensen (2007).

Clever criminal court judges are able to manage long and unpredictable case lists.,"Judgecraft – or how judges go about their tasks in the courtroom – is a practical skill that is limited by the nature of judicial authority.  “Conventional adversarial norms require a formally passive judicial role…” and thus “active judicial intervention can be in tension with this principle.” Yet “the legitimacy of judicial authority rests in part on the extent to which people perceive that they are treated fairly by judicial officers they encounter.  This suggests that a more active engagement by judicial officers is required for legitimacy” (p. 342)., This observational study of Australian magistrates’ criminal courts notes that active management of the court takes the judge outside the safe passive role and “may risk the legitimacy of adversarial authority,” but also requires cooperation of the other parties in the court.  Nevertheless, research has demonstrated that “perceptions that the police or judges tried hard to be fair and were polite emerge as especially important in citizen contacts with the police and courts” (p. 345).  The problem is that being fair and sensibly managing the activities of the court conflict with the classic passive role of the judge in adversarial proceedings., Effective magistrates appear to have searched for ways to move each case through the court process.  For example, active magistrates were able to turn requests for adjournments into delays until later in the day when progress could be made to move the case along.  Nevertheless, of the 1287 matters that were observed as part of this study, about a third were adjourned.   The most common reason for adjournment related to getting legal representation for the accused (26%), the need for more information (10%) or providing disclosure to the defence (12%).  But in 17% of the adjourned cases no reason was offered or given in open court.  Standing a matter down until later in the day was done most often to ensure that relevant parties (e.g., the lawyer) or required information was available (37%).  Although magistrates relatively rarely initiated adjournments (15%), “the striking characteristic of standing matters down was that it occurred most commonly at the suggestion of the magistrate” [62% of all stand-downs] reflecting the magistrates desire “to get through the list in a way that does not delay other matters which are ready to go, and to move cases along toward final resolution” (p. 353). Of those matters that were stood down until later in the day 68% were completed or set for another procedure (e.g., trail or sentence).  Though this ‘success’ rate is not dramatically higher than that of all other matters (61%),  it is dramatically better than simply adjourning the case to another day.  Had that been done, the success rate would have been zero., Conclusion. In exercising ‘judgecraft’ by suggesting solutions to problems that would otherwise keep a case from going forward,  magistrates obviously run the risk of undermining the legitimacy of the adversarial process.  Nevertheless “when active intervention is used to consider the defendant’s circumstances more carefully, it may enhance judicial legitimacy to the extent that it rests on the fairness values exhibited when judicial officers engage with those whose claims they adjudicate… The ways in which these magistrates exercised judgecraft sometimes effectively created a limited space for more meaningful interactions” (p. 358).  In accomplishing effective time management goals, it would appear that magistrates were able to “create space for a more engaged and therefore more legitimate decision-making process within the limits of conventional adversarial norms and practices.  This achievement is especially important in the highly interactive context of the criminal list where most members of the public encounter the court system” (p. 359)., Reference.  Mack, Kathy and Sharyn Roach Anleu.

Ordinary citizens who are fully informed about the sentences that are handed down in criminal cases are likely to be relatively content with those sentences.,", Survey data collected in Great Britain, Canada, and Australia, among other countries, suggest that a majority of ordinary citizens think that criminal sentences are too lenient.   Though these surveys undoubtedly suggest real dissatisfaction on the part of citizens with the sentences of the court, the reasons for this dissatisfaction are not clear.  Previous research shows quite clearly that people do not know much about sentencing principles, sentencing practices, or the various factors that traditionally are part of judges’ decision on the appropriate sentence.  Nevertheless, British and Australian survey evidence suggests that a substantial portion of people think that judges are out of touch with the views of the public., In this study, carried out in Victoria, Australia, actual cases were presented to ordinary members of the public by the judge who handed down the sentence.   Cases were chosen that involved serious offending (an armed robbery with minimal violence with an unloaded gun, rape at knifepoint by a neighbour of the victim, multiple stabbings, and a theft of a million dollars worth of goods from a company by two employees)., Employees in 32 workplaces participated by attending two sessions, typically a week apart. In the first, the employees listened to a 70-minute general talk about sentencing. In the second, the judge presented his sentencing judgement which included the facts of the case, the circumstances of the offender, and information about the law and current sentencing practice. The judge did not point to a particular sentence or possible range of sentence.  Participants were told that they were not bound by sentencing law or practice., In three of the four cases, the median of the sentences imposed by over 100 participants per case was less than the court’s actual sentence. In these three cases between 63% and 86% of the respondents would have handed down a sentence more lenient than the sentence of the court.  In the fourth case (in which only 35% suggested a sentence more lenient than the actual sentence) the median sentence recommended by ordinary people was 3.2 years compared to the court’s sentence of 3 years.  There was huge variation among the participants as to what the appropriate sentence was. In addition, many participants wanted offenders with personality disorders to receive a program of treatment along with a custodial sentence. “The community does rely on offender factors favouring leniency, not only offence seriousness” (p. 777)., Conclusion.  “The results cast doubt on the populist view of judicial sentencing as lenient, and, hence, the wisdom of increasing the severity of sentences to satisfy what was believed to be a harsher public….  What the present study also says about the move to harsher sentencing [in many countries] at least for certain types of offence, is that it may not represent the general public’s sense of justice” (p. 779)., Reference.

Troublesome children in school are not necessarily offenders outside of school.,", It is easy to categorize a youth as being troublesome based on observations made in a single setting.  School policies that focus on troublesome youths are sometimes justified on the basis of assumptions that these youths are also very likely to be offenders, or will develop into full-blown delinquents.  But what if the behaviour across time and place is not as consistent as these assumptions would suggest?, It is well established that school misbehaviour is, in part, a function of characteristics of the school (see Criminological Highlights, V4N2#4, V5N5#5) rather than the youth within it.  The challenge, therefore, for school or criminal justice professionals is to determine what inferences one should draw when a youth is misbehaving in school. This paper looks at the consistency of the behaviour of youths in school and in the community measured when they were 13-16 years old and again three years later., About 1400 Dutch students from a number of different schools in a range of different sized communities filled out self-report questionnaires in school. Students were asked to report whether they had engaged in any of nine different forms of school misbehaviour (e.g., bullying, thefts, fighting, making threats) and 12 ordinary criminal behaviour outside of school (vandalism, shoplifting, other thefts, robbery, fighting) during the previous nine months.  When the youths were age 13-16, there was a relationship between the reporting of any school misbehaviour and reporting of any ordinary criminal behaviour. Specifically, of those who reported misbehaviour in school, 55.9% reported at least some ordinary criminal behaviour outside of school.  For those reported that they had not misbehaved in school only 15% reported being involved in ordinary criminal behaviour out of school.  Even when one looks at serious misbehaviour in school (more serious thefts, fighting with injury, threatening or assaulting a teacher), the relationship to any criminal behaviour or serious criminal behaviour (more serious thefts or burglary outside of school, wounding someone, robbery) was rather modest.  Among the small number of youths involved in serious misbehaviour in school (about 12% of the population as a whole), fewer than half  (42%) were involved in serious criminal behaviour outside of school., Predicting future criminal behaviour was equally problematic. Although those involved in criminal behavior or school misbehaviour at age 13-16 were more likely to be involved in criminal behaviour or school misbehaviour three years later when they were 16-19, these relationships were not very strong.  Of those who were involved in serious school misbehaviour when they were 13-16 years old, only 28% were involved in serious criminal behaviour outside of school three years later. Of the 64% involved in at least some misbehaviour in school when they were 13-16 years old, only 12.1% were involved in serious criminal behaviour three years later.  Although 49% of the youths who misbehaved in school were involved in at least some crime (mostly minor) three years later, this proportion was only slightly higher than the prevalence in the sample as a whole (40%)., Conclusion: The overall finding that there is not a very strong general relationship between misbehaviour in school and ordinary offending suggests that decision makers should be cautious in assuming that just because a young person is misbehaving in school that he or she is highly likely to commit serious crime later on.  The evidence does not support the inference that “misbehaviour [serious or any] is a marker for delinquency, in contradiction to the suggestion… that bullying is a marker for serious delinquency” (p. 374). At the same time, it needs to be remembered that those involved in serious misbehaviour in school are somewhat more likely to be committing crime than are those who have not misbehaved in school., Reference:  Weerman, Frank M., Paul Harland, and Peter H. van der Laan (2007).

"There are ways to control pretrial detention populations. A separate processing centre with around-the-clock, seven-day-a-week processing of cases reduced processing times dramatically for most of those who were arrested for offences.",", Jail populations (those in pretrial detention and those serving ‘short’ sentences) in the U.S. have increased from about 182 thousand in 1980 to about 748 thousand in 2005.  “The most commonly adopted [American] response [to this increase] was to expand jail capacity” (p. 273)., This study reports on one U.S. county’s efforts to control jail and police lock-up populations in a mid-size midwestern city. A new facility was created in which arrestee processing, case screening, contact with defence counsel, and initial court hearings were to be conducted on a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week basis for misdemeanours and minor nonviolent felony offences. The idea was that these matters would be dealt with immediately rather than over a period of days or weeks.  Prior to the opening of this special centre, cases had been processed much as they are elsewhere: screening, initial hearings, etc., only happened periodically during normal court hours. Since accused people are unable to schedule their arrests to occur only during normal court hours, there is obviously a mismatch between efficient court processing and the time of arrest. On the assumption that it would be easier to change the court schedule than the timing of arrests, this project was created to deal more effectively with initial court processing., The changed system involved around-the-clock screening of cases such that a decision could be made almost instantly about whether a case should be prosecuted. Rather than scheduling all cases for one or two times a day (on weekdays), initial court hearings were scheduled for approximately 20 different times a day.  Police officers were required to file all paperwork within four hours of arrest.  Prior to the implementation, this process took an average of 27 hours with a great deal of variation; after implementation it required an average of about 4 hours with relatively little variation.  Prior to starting the new program, about 71 hours (approximately 3 days) would elapse between the time that case screening took place and the initial court appearance. Some cases took much longer. Under the new program, this process took only four hours (with little variation). When one looks at the time spent in custody by those for whom no charges were ultimately filed, the average person spent a total of 24 hours in custody prior to the new program. After the program, the average time was reduced to about 9 hours.  For those released on recognizance, people spent an average of 24 hours in custody prior to the program and 10 hours after. Those who had bond set by the court and who had to meet this bond to be released spent about the same amount of time in custody under the new program as they had under the earlier system., Conclusion: Under the new procedure, initial processing times for those who are arrested and brought to court were reduced considerably.  While there are large numbers of such people, they do not, because of fast turnover, consume a proportionately large portion of jail space.  Nevertheless, the most important factor may be that a large portion of those arrested were released quickly on a recognizance or did not have charges filed against them, dramatically reducing their time in pretrial detention., Reference: Baumer, Terry L.

The minimum rate of factual wrongful convictions for rape-murders in the United States is estimated to be 3.3%.  What is the rate for other offences?,", Estimating the wrongful conviction rate is a challenge for two reasons. First, identifying “factually” wrongful convictions requires a court to determine that people who had once been found guilty are, in fact, factually innocent. This is most likely to occur as a result of new DNA evidence. Second, one has to estimate the denominator: What is the population from which these wrongful convictions is drawn?, United States Supreme Court Justice Scalia, for example, endorses the approach taken by Oregon prosecutor Joshua Marquis who starts from the finding that perhaps as many as 400 innocent people were known to have been convicted in the U.S. in the 15 year period ending in 2003 (Criminological Highlights, 7(5)#3).   Marquis then suggests that even if one were to assume that the actual number of wrongful convictions were ten times that many, this number (4000) would constitute only 0.027% of the 15 million felony convictions during that period in the U.S.   The problem, of course, is not so much with the numerator as with the denominator (all felony convictions). The estimate of ‘400 cases’ is based, obviously, only on those cases in which various groups have demonstrated that an innocent person was convicted. Most felony convictions (for less serious felonies) do not get much attention. Hence the legitimacy of these convictions is untested.  Furthermore, the numerator is based almost exclusively on cases in which the identity of the offender was the key issue., This paper looks carefully at evidence related to both the numerator and the denominator in rape-murder cases in the 1980s (before DNA evidence became relatively routine).  The numerator should represent the number of factually wrongful convictions of a particular type that is capable of being reversed.  The denominator, then, must be the total number of such cases (e.g., rape-murders convictions with DNA evidence) some of which have subsequently been found to be innocent. Depending on certain assumptions, there were either 10 or 11 capital cases involving rape-murder in which the defendant was exonerated.  It was estimated that there were 479 capital cases involving rape-murder during this period.  But exonerations can only occur in those cases in which usable DNA connected with the perpetrator is available. It turns out that the best estimate is that in one third of rape-murder cases, usable DNA was not available during this period.  Hence the denominator estimate of 479 needs to be discounted by one-third. One can conclude, therefore, that about 3.3% (10.5 divided by 319) of rape-murder cases are likely to be wrongful convictions., Obviously, the estimate of 3.3% wrongful convictions in capital murder-rape cases without DNA evidence at trial cannot automatically be generalized to other crimes.  Yet the argument for generalizing to other capital crimes in the U.S. in which perpetrator identity is the main issue is rather compelling.  Circumstances (e.g., the nature of the jury and the views of jury of the importance of the cases) are likely to be similar.   For non-capital cases, one might expect that juries might not feel quite the same obligation to be certain of their decisions. This would suggest a higher error rate for these cases., Conclusion.  If a careful estimate of the number of wrongful convictions in capital cases of rape-murder and of the population from which these convictions arise suggests that one in 30 of these convictions is wrong, what can be done?  The saying that “It is better that ten guilty men go free than that one innocent person be convicted” does not give us much specific direction, but it does remind us that, to some extent, the trade-off is a real one., Reference.

Good management of forensic services in police departments can increase the rate of apprehension of offenders.,", The use of ‘ordinary’ forensic services (e.g., fingerprints and DNA) by police forces creates special challenges because these services can be costly, time consuming, and can delay ‘ordinary’ investigations.  It is sometimes suggested that large police forces, because they can afford to have more specialized staff, are better able to use forensic services than are smaller, less bureaucratic, forces.  This study looked at all 41 English police forces (excluding the London police forces) to see if size matters in the solving of crime with forensic services., Looking at domestic burglary and theft of/from motor vehicles, it was found that England’s smaller police forces (those with fewer than 4000 police officers) were very slightly more likely to identify offenders for these property crimes than were large police forces.   What was more notable, however, was that the percent of crimes detected by forensic means (fingerprints or DNA) was considerably higher, on average, in the smaller police forces. The average number of crime scenes visited per crime scene examiner was roughly the same for large and small police forces, and the ratio of fingerprint experts to police officers was  more or less constant across police forces of different sizes. However, the number of positive identifications of offenders per fingerprint expert was, on average, considerably higher in the smaller police forces than in the larger ones.  For fingerprint evidence with residential burglaries and motor vehicle offences, it would appear that small police forces were able to exercise greater informal control over the crime scene examiner’s use of resources  by focusing on those crime scenes most likely to provide useful forensic evidence. Clearly, however, there is nothing special about small police forces that makes it impossible to transfer good practice to larger forces.  It may simply be that managing resources effectively needs to be given more explicit attention in larger police forces., An alternative approach to the management of the use of forensic services was implemented by the Northamptonshire (England) police in 2004.  Policing standards were created requiring that strict guidelines be followed on the timely processing of fingerprint and other forensic resources and evidence.  With explicit targets the timeliness of these reports increased dramatically.  For example, all fingerprints from domestic burglaries were to be processed and a report produced within one working day of these data being collected.  Police were required, within the guideline, to take action on positive results of the forensic investigation within 1.5 days of the fingerprint results being returned to the investigating officer. The performance of members of the police service was carefully monitored. Setting explicit and quite stringent standards appeared to increase the ability of the police forces to detect crime with forensic tools.  However, after the study was over, and performance targets were relaxed, the effectiveness of forensic services in detecting offenders dropped to pre-existing levels., Conclusion: Effective management of forensic resources within police forces can affect their usefulness. In smaller police forces, it may be easier to prioritize work informally.  In larger forces, it would appear that methods such as setting explicit, defensible, and enforced performance standards may be a useful management tool., Reference: Townsley, Michael and John W.

Contractual arrangements between the government and those in the public sector who were  managing a recently opened prison set the stage for a prison riot.,", Prison riots have traditionally been explained using two approaches: (a) deprivation theory which suggests that riots are the result of poor conditions and overly punitive internal controls and (b) administrative breakdowns in which “changes to the political structure, management, or social order fabric of a prison will create the necessary conditions for a riot to occur….”  (p. 120).  More recent evidence has suggested that riots occur when there are increased demands on prison administrators without resources to address those demands, discontent among correctional staff, and concerns among prisoners about such matters as unjust treatment or poor conditions.  But in addition, “administration or agency dysfunction at senior levels can [have an impact on] internal prison operations and can create dissatisfaction” (p. 121) leading to the breakdown of informal behavioural norms that keep a prison under control., This is a case study of a prison that opened in March 1997 and experienced a riot three weeks later. It turns out that in order to understand why a riot occurred, it is necessary to examine the context of a new contractual arrangement between those in the public sector running the prison and the Queensland, Australia, government. When the decision to open a new prison was made, the Queensland government allowed private sector companies to submit bids to build and run the prison, but allowed its own (public sector) correctional service to bid as well.  The Queensland Corrective Services Commission (the public sector bidder) won the bid. Various concessions related to staffing and traditional union power were made as part of the bid in order to win the contract.  In theory, the proposal from the public sector provided the government with a number of important efficiencies., But there were some significant risks. In order to get past what was seen as a previous staff culture that was overly punitive and illegitimate, new (inexperienced) staff were hired.  The result was that when the new prison opened, 58% of the staff had no correctional experience. The general manager of the prison had no previous experience in a similar position, though he did have an extensive corrections background.  A large proportion of the prisoners sent to the new prison were drawn from the highest security classifications. In addition, the largely inexperienced staff had other challenges in dealing with prisoners: “No physical barrier existed between the keepers and the kept” (p. 130) and staff were not comfortable with this arrangement. Staff all wore the same uniform; hence it was difficult to know what the responsibilities were of different staff who did not recognize one another. And to make an already difficult situation worse, because of pressures elsewhere in the correctional system, the prison was filled quickly – more quickly than had been anticipated.  Because the prison was being run under a new contractual arrangement, management could not ask for additional resources., Meals – always a matter of contention in any institution – were provided and delivered using a new system that resulted in the food arriving cold.  Prisoners were not allowed to smoke.  The senior official (in the government) who made this decision was told that it was ill-advised given that, among other reasons, smoking was allowed in other institutions.  The result was inevitable:  “Insufficient staff, shift problems, and conflict between program, security, and unit staff, combined to cause considerable internal tension” that management ignored.  Because of pressures elsewhere in the correctional system, the prison was filled quickly – more quickly than had been anticipated.  On the one hand, the prison was being run under the new contractual arrangement introduced under the bidding system, and so management could not ask for additional resources. On the other hand, the prison was seen as a public institution that has an obligation to provide prison spaces, and so management could not stem the flow., Conclusion.  “The successful public-sector bid in an open-market test created an additional external pressure other than coping with the expected stress of commissioning a new prison.  The rapid influx of prisoners exceeded the ability of the prison to initiate the contracted reform” (p. 135) but to change the rules would have brought the bid decision into disrepute.  A private prison, on the other hand, would have been more likely to be able to resist pressure from the government to take additional prisoners., Reference: Rynne, John, Richard W.

"Finland’s relatively high homicide rate appears to be the result of the economic marginalization – within a relatively generous welfare state – of older, geographically isolated, unemployed men.",", Finland’s homicide rate of about 2.8 per hundred thousand residents is considerably higher than those of most other northern European nations (e.g., Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland which have rates of about 1 per hundred thousand).  However, Finland does not have any of the characteristics – e.g., poverty, income inequality, other forms of social instability – often associated with relatively high homicide rates., Why is Finland’s homicide rate so high?  Compared to six other northern European countries, this study shows that Finland’s homicide victims and offenders are more likely to be older and are more likely to be have been intoxicated from alcohol at the time of the offence.  Only 17% of Finnish homicide offenders were employed at the time of the offence, compared to about 30% in Sweden and Norway (the only other Nordic countries for which data were available).  Homicide rates in Finland are highest in the economically and demographically declining northern and eastern parts of the country.  However, compared to other major cities in northern Europe, Helsinki’s homicide rate of about 2.5 victims per hundred thousand was about average (Oslo 1.7, Copenhagen 3.4, Stockholm 2.7).   “A typical Finnish homicide occurs in a private dwelling as a result of a drunken dispute between friends, family, or acquaintances.  Both the victim and the offender tend to be chronically unemployed middle-aged men” (p. 74-5).  Over the past century, the age specific rates of homicides committed by older men have increased dramatically., Finland has a relatively generous social welfare system.  In the past 50 years, demand for low-skilled labour has declined (especially in the northern and eastern parts of the country in which homicide rates have increased dramatically in the past 40 years). Those who were victims of these changes were absorbed into the national social security systems that, in effect, created a group of men on permanent public assistance. Seventeen percent of offenders and 24% of victims at the end of the 20th century were on permanent public assistance.  Alcohol use has always been heavily involved  in Finnish homicides. And heavy rates of alcohol use in a population of permanently unemployed older men in semi-rural economically depressed locations appears to be a lethal combination., Conclusion. Finland is an exception to the general rule that nations with policies of ‘collective protection’ (p. 84) have the lowest rate of lethal violence.  High homicide rates in Finland may relate to a culture that has traditionally had a strong link between high rates of alcohol use and lethal violence.  Within that culture, a growing population of permanently unemployed older men involved in heavy drinking appears to be especially vulnerable to involvement in homicides.  “The lethal lifestyle of this population explains why the homicide rate in Finland is higher than in other Nordic nations” (p. 85)., Reference.

The immediate reduction of recidivism may not be the only appropriate goal for restorative justice procedures.,"Traditionally, restorative justice programs in the criminal justice system have had two quite distinct goals: to involve and meet the needs of victims of crime and to reduce reoffending. In the past decade or so, restorative justice programs have become increasingly popular in many western countries. At the same time, it would appear that the goal of immediately reducing reoffending is tending to eclipse, in the minds of policy makers, the more traditional goals of addressing the needs of victims and of creating more subtle changes in the offender., This paper suggests that “there is a case to be made for a subtle shift in ways of thinking about the recidivism reduction potential of restorative justice… [by thinking of it] as an opportunity to facilitate a desire, or consolidate a decision, to desist [from crime]” (p. 337).  Some of the theoretical literature on restorative justice has attempted to distance itself from the simple goal of reducing reoffending, in part because it is argued that it is unrealistic and in part because such an emphasis diminishes the importance of victim-centred goals.  However, “benefits for offenders, such as reducing reoffending or rehabilitation…. are actually often welcomed and desired by victims” (p. 340).  Hence these two separate goals should not be seen as being in opposition to one another.  In a study of 280 conferences involving adult offenders who had committed a range of offences against persons (i.e., rather than organizations or businesses) it was found that outcome agreements tended to focus largely on offenders’ future behaviour rather than on victims’ needs.  For many victims “an offender’s stated intention to ‘do something’ about their offending behaviour constituted a form of reparation” (p. 341) and was a legitimate and welcomed outcome of the restorative process., “Desistance, or offenders stopping offending … is increasingly regarded as a process of gradually decreasing offending, rather than a sudden one-off decision not to offend again…” (p. 347).   Indeed, it is possible “that, for at least some offenders, a restorative justice event may be less a trigger for desistance than a potentially significant ‘stepping stone’ on a journey toward desistance on which they have already embarked” (p. 347).  Hence giving offenders an opportunity to consider changing their lives “could [constitute] rare but important safe spaces for offenders intending to desist to consider the next few months of their lives and how those months could be lived” (p. 348).  Clearly, if this is the case, then conferences would be likely to be effective only for those offenders who have voluntarily consented to the restorative conference process., Conclusion: Although many have argued that it is unreasonable to expect restorative justice processes such as conferences to have dramatic and immediate impacts on reoffending, it might be more appropriate to think of restorative justice events as providing offenders with  “an opportunity to facilitate a desire, or consolidate a decision, to desist” (p. 352). The reduction of offending is a legitimate goal for restorative justice, “but it is a goal which must be seen both in the context of other legitimate goals for restorative justice (not least victim-centred ones) and in the context of the messy and unpredictable ‘real world’ in which restorative justice encounters take place” (p. 353).  “To the extent that such encounters are voluntarily entered into by offenders, there is a high likelihood that at least some will take the opportunity to participate as a means of consolidating or reinforcing a decision to desist” (p. 352-3).   Hence “the potential of restorative justice to ‘deliver’ reductions in reoffending… will always be circumscribed” (p. 353)., Reference: Robinson, Gwen and Joanna Shapland (2008).  Reducing Recidivism: A Task for Restorative Justice?

English trial judges who have extensive experience with serious and complex fraud trials have confidence in the juries that hear these cases.,", It is sometimes suggested that jurors may be capable of making appropriate decisions in ‘ordinary’ criminal cases, but they cannot do an adequate job with long, complex trials. These suggestions have been challenged in studies of jurors in actual complex cases and in detailed studies of those who serve on juries (See Criminological Highlights, V9N1#6, V2N2#8), though it is clear that in some cases, the job of the jury could be made easier (see Criminological Highlights, V3N3#8). In this study, a New York State Supreme Court Judge interviewed nine of the ten English judges who had recently tried, with a jury, serious fraud cases. The focus of the interview was the debate over whether these cases should be tried by a judge alone., All nine judges held a “firm belief that juries have the capacity to understand properly litigated complex fraud cases” (p. 750) and should continue to hear these cases.  They suggested that “usually the complexity of a serious fraud case gradually evaporates as the trial progresses when the proof is competently and carefully presented” (p. 754).  The judges all indicated that they agreed with a very high proportion of jury verdicts in cases that they presided over.  One judge noted, “I have been surprised less often by the jury’s verdict in long cases than perhaps in short cases” (p. 754).  Another judge suggested that when he didn’t agree with the verdict, he still understood why the jury came to the decision it did.  A consistent theme was that juries in long complex cases were more likely to arrive at the same verdict as the judge., Judges agreed that juries acquired a good understanding of the evidence in these cases. Sometimes this was evident to the judge from the questions that the jury asked, and by the pattern of the decisions in multiple charge or multiple defendant cases.  At the same time, “Many of the judges observed that the quality of case preparation and trial advocacy are both essential to juror understanding” (p. 759). One judge noted that the real issue is the “competence of the prosecution in cases where juries don’t understand, not the competence of the jury” (p. 759). These findings are consistent with a ‘mock jury’ study which evaluated comprehension and competence in a complex case that was presented to people outside of the court setting., Conclusion:  Given that the English judges believed, on the basis of their own personal experience, that juries are capable of understanding the evidence and rendering defensible verdicts, it is not surprising that these specialists in complex fraud cases that are normally heard by a judge-and-jury did not support proposals to replace juries with judge-alone trials.  Indeed, the judges were not uniformly confident that cases would be shorter if heard by a judge alone. Judges feared that prosecutors might “put boxes of materials and extra charges before the judge” (p. 760) because they might think that the judge was more capable of handling such material. One wonders whether the disillusionment with juries, in some quarters, comes from the difficulty in presenting complex cases rather than with the juries themselves. The judges appeared to agree that an important part of serious fraud prosecutions is the organization of the evidence and effective advocacy by those presenting the cases., Reference: Julian, Robert F.

Using predictive risk assessments to determine sentences in ordinary criminal cases punishes large numbers of people based on notions of what someone else might do.,", Many criminal justice systems use predictions of recidivism at some stage of the criminal justice process. Offenders being released from prison are often assessed for risk of reoffending in part so that resources can be allocated in a manner that might reduce those risks.  Parole boards use risk assessment tools to try to minimize the number of people who commit offences while on parole. But when determining how much punishment a person should receive “There is a threshold ethical dilemma that we seldom consider: how good must predictive efforts be to justify using them to take restrictive actions…?” (p. 700)., Although judges in many sentencing systems are forced to make decisions about offender riskiness, the state of Virginia chose to rely on a formal quantitative risk assessment tool to determine sentences for non-violent felony offenders. Interestingly, they chose not to rely on a ‘needs assessment’ that might have been used to try to identify services to reduce the likelihood that an offender would re-offend. The study that Virginia chose to base its sentencing guidelines on used data from a single cohort of offenders who had been incarcerated and then released during an 18 month period in the early 1990s.  These offenders were followed for 3 years to see who was reconvicted of a felony. The study showed that recidivism was higher if the offender was male, young, unmarried, unemployed, acted alone at the time of the offence, had multiple convictions, had a criminal record (especially for drugs), and had been incarcerated as an adult or child. Those with ‘low risk’ scores were deemed eligible for non-custodial sentences. The recidivism study also showed that blacks were more likely to re-offend than whites, but the sentencing commission decided against using race in sentencing because “the commission viewed race as a proxy for social and economic disadvantage” (p. 705). Judges could depart from the guideline sentence (i.e., the risk assessment sentence) but they only did so in about 19% of the cases., Since this law was implemented in 2002, various concerns have been raised including the fact that the predictors themselves may be flawed since they were derived from a study that only followed those released from incarceration. In other words, the guidelines are not informed by the subsequent behaviour of those who received non-custodial sentences.  More importantly, “the reality of risk-based assessment is that it involves considerable error” (p. 711). In the Virginia scheme, for example, it was estimated that only 24% of those who were recommended for a prison sentence (for incapacitation) would actually re-offend. Even though this was higher than the rate of those for whom a non-custodial sentence was recommended, the error rate is clearly high.  And of course, the consequence of focusing sentencing decisions on predictions of future behaviour is that sentences cannot be proportional to the harm that was done. This is because it is almost inevitable that ‘harm’ and ‘recidivism risk’ would not lead to the same ordering of cases., Conclusion: Under Virginia’s sentencing scheme, individuals are punished because the predictions concerning the ‘group’ to which they belong (e.g., young, unmarried, unemployed males) rather than because of something they themselves did.  Because people with certain characteristics are more likely to offend than are people without those characteristics, those with those characteristics receive harsher punishments.  This occurs even though it is well established that many of those with those characteristics will not re-offend. The labels associated with the group may reflect ‘life style’ variables and may not be ‘causal’ in a real sense. A person with the characteristics that predict future recidivism will, therefore, be punished because of those characteristics (e.g., being unemployed) rather than because of anything that the offender has done. Who the offender is, rather than what the offender has done, is the crucial variable under a ‘predicted recidivism’ model., Reference: Netter, Brian (2007).  Using Group Statistics to Sentence Individual Criminals: An Ethical and Statistical Critique of the Virginia Risk Assessment Program.

"Police crackdowns on the carrying of illegal guns may have an impact on gun crime, though the results should not be considered to be conclusive.",", Cracking down on gun crime by systematically searching for illegal guns, enhanced surveillance of probationers and parolees, and weapon-reporting hotlines are all approaches used by police in many cities to deal with this form of serious crime.  Because these crackdowns typically happen in locations that have recently experienced large numbers of high profile gun crimes, they generally suffer from ‘regression’ artefacts: decreases are plausibly the result of ‘natural’ reversion to pre-existing levels of crime rather than to programs initiated by the police.  This paper examined the research literature on this topic and located studies that took place in three American and two Columbian cities that had relatively adequate, but not ideal, data that address the effectiveness of these crackdowns.  None involved randomized controlled trials., All of the studies examined directed patrols in which additional police officers were assigned to high-crime areas at high risk times.  These officers were supposed to focus on proactive investigation and enforcement rather than answering calls for service., Conclusion: It is possible that increased police presence and proactive approaches to gun carrying had an impact on gun crime, but the data are not completely convincing.  Further, the effects, such as they are, do not appear to last beyond the period of increased police activity. The one clear finding from this summary is that police departments that are interested in determining the impact of their programs need to implement them in a manner that allows for adequate evaluation., Reference: Koper, Christopher S. and Evan Mayo-Wilson (2006).

In the Scottish youth justice system – which operates explicitly on welfare principles – those children who penetrated most deeply into the formal system were most likely to re-offend.,", Careful analyses of treatment programs for youths (see Criminological Highlights V7N4#1) would suggest that effective programs are not likely to reduce substantially reoffending by youths. In addition, there has sometimes been “a rather naïve assumption among policy makers that measures that appear to work in one jurisdiction can be successfully transplanted into others, without any need to consider differences in the culture and social contexts within which such measures are to be implemented” (p. 317).  At the same time, “there is a growing body of research… which indicates that contact with the youth justice system and experience with more severe forms of sanctioning, in particular, are as likely to result in enhanced as in diminished offending risk” (p. 318)., This study examines the impact of the Scottish model of youth justice on future offending.  Rather than being based on punishment by a court, the core of the Scottish youth justice system uses a lay tribunal to address the needs of the child. It is designed to “avoid criminalization and hence stigmatization of young people” (p. 320).  Since 1995, however, public protection can take priority if there is a risk to the child and/or the public. Youth cases in Scotland typically start with a police officer who may or may not charge a youth. If charged, the youth is referred to a police Juvenile Liaison Officer (JLO). The JLO may or may not refer the case to the Reporter who may or may not refer the case to a panel for a full hearing. “The principal role of the Reporter [in this context] is to investigate the case to determine whether at least one of the statutory grounds for referral to a hearing has been met and that the child is in need of compulsory measures of care” (p. 321), This study demonstrates that boys and disadvantaged children as well as youths who had a history of offending were more likely to be charged by the police officer than were children who did not have these characteristics. “Children who reported that they had been charged in previous years were over seven times more likely to be charged at age 15 than were children with no such a history – a factor that is completely independent of their current involvement in serious offending….” (p. 327). Being from non-two-birth-parent families and having previously been referred to the Reporter increased the likelihood of being referred by the JLO to the Reporter. Hearings were more likely to be held for youths who had many charges, those who were assessed as having many needs, and those who were disadvantaged.  When other factors were controlled, “children who have been identified as troublemakers in previous years are significantly more likely to be charged and subsequently referred to the Reporter” (p. 330)., Children who were chosen for more serious interventions (by the original police officer, or by the JLO, or by the Reporter) at each stage of the process were compared to a second group. This second group consisted of children who did not receive the more serious intervention but who were similar to the youths in the first group on those factors that reflected the reasons for the decision to refer the case deeper into the system. Those who were charged by the police did not differ from similar children who were not charged in their rates of self-reported offending (theft from a motor vehicle, riding in a stolen vehicle, carrying an offensive weapon, housebreaking, arson, robbery, or any of six types of violence). Similarly, referral by the JLO to the Reporter did not appear to affect the subsequent prevalence of serious offending.  “However, those who were brought to children’s hearings [when they were approximately 14.5 to 15.5 years old] were significantly more likely to report involvement in serious offending one year later than were their comparable counterparts” (p. 333).  It appeared that those who were not brought to a hearing reduced their level of offending, but those who “were brought to a children’s hearing on offence grounds and made subject to compulsory measures of care… [showed] no significant reduction in their self-reported frequency of serious offending” (p. 334)., Conclusion: The findings “add further weight to the international research evidence that youth justice systems may be congenitally unable to deliver the reductions in offending” (p. 339) that some policies and policy makers assume to be possible. It is argued that “the key to reducing youth offending lies in maximum diversion and minimal intervention” even in this system “that is explicitly aimed at decriminalization and destigmatization” (p. 340)., Reference: McAra, Lesley and Susan McVie (2007).  Youth Justice?

"The incarceration of mothers with young children contributes to crime: their children, as adults, are more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system than are children of mothers who are equally involved in crime, but who avoided being incarcerated.",", In the U.S. it is estimated that 63% of incarcerated women have one or more minor children, most living with them prior to incarceration and that 7% of African American children have a parent in federal or state prison.  Various problems for children – e.g., depression, anxiety, school-related difficulties, substance abuse, and aggressive/antisocial behaviour – have been linked to parental incarceration., In this study, a large national (American) sample of children was repeatedly surveyed from childhood into early adulthood.   Some of the questions asked of the respondents (the youths) involved whether a parent was incarcerated at the time of the interview.  Respondents were followed into early adulthood and their criminal convictions were recorded.  The study included various control variables in an attempt to separate out the effect of the incarceration of the mother from other related factors (e.g., absence of the mother for other reasons, delinquency of the child, the mother’s involvement in crime), as well as standard demographic variables such as gender, race, education of the child and of the mother, whether the mother was an adolescent when the child was born., The focus of the study is on adult criminal involvement measured by whether or not respondents were convicted of an offence in adult court up to age 21. The main comparison was between survey respondents whose mothers had or had not been incarcerated at some point during the respondents’ childhood years.  The findings are clear:  those study participants whose mother had been incarcerated were considerably more likely to have been convicted in adult court (26%) than were those study participants whose mothers had not been incarcerated (only 10% of these respondents were convicted)., The results showed some of the usual correlates of criminality.  Those youths who indicated that they felt peer pressure to get involved in various criminal activities were, as adults, more likely to have an adult conviction.  And those who had not lived with their mothers for at least some time for reasons other than the mother’s incarceration were more likely to be involved in crime.  And, of course, males were more likely to have been convicted as adults than were females.  Maternal offending had a small effect on whether the youth, as an adult, was convicted, but had a significant impact on whether the youth reported ever being on adult probation., Above and beyond these effects (and the delinquency of the respondent as a youth), those youths whose mothers had been incarcerated when they were young were, as adults, more likely to have been convicted of a criminal offence.  Interestingly, “maternal imprisonment did not appear to be a risk marker for poor home environments…. although children of incarcerated mothers did report significantly lower levels of parental supervision” (p. 292)., Conclusion: Although it not completely clear why maternal incarceration is linked with the adult offending of their offspring, it is clear that the effect is not simply that the mothers were themselves offenders or that it is a continuation of childhood delinquency of the child.  Part of the effect could, of course, be that the incarceration of the mother is yet another form of maternal absence which, itself, appears to have impacts on offending.  Whatever the reason, however, it would appear that there are collateral impacts of maternal incarceration on children and these effects persist into early adulthood., Reference: Huebner, Beth M. and Regan Gustafson (2007).

Treatment can reduce the likelihood that sex offenders will re-offend.,", Many people appear to believe that sex offenders are different from other offenders on two important dimensions: recidivism rates and treatability.  They are often seen as being very likely to reoffend and to be untreatable.  It is well established that sex offenders do not have especially high rates of recidivism (See Criminological Highlights, V3N3#3, V5N1#4, V6N3#3, V6N6#8, V8N3#8, V9N2#5). This paper addresses the second issue: Can sex offenders be effectively treated?, Research on the effectiveness of treatment programs for sex offenders is often difficult to carry out in progressive prison systems because, as serious offenders, they are often universally required to participate in treatment programs, making it difficult to find an equivalent comparison group.   This review looked at studies of treatment programs for sex offenders that had the following characteristics: the treatment had to include a therapeutic, not simply a deterrent, intervention; recidivism had to be measured; there had to be a comparison group; and both the treatment and control group had to have a plausible number of offenders to allow for comparisons to be made.  Sixty-nine papers containing 80 separate studies were located, most having been published since 1990. Thirty-seven of the 80 studies examined cognitive-behavioural programs., Looking at ‘treatment programs’ overall, there was an average rate of sexual recidivism for the untreated control offenders of 17.5%. This was reduced to a rate of 11.1% re-offending for the treated offenders.  Results for other types of offending were similar.  Looking at overall recidivism, among those who had not been treated, about 33% of the offenders committed a new offence; with treatment, this rate was reduced to about 22%.  The physical treatments that were examined (surgical castration or hormonal treatments) had the largest impacts.  For psychosocial treatments, only cognitive-behavioural treatments and classic behaviour therapy had significant impacts on sexual recidivism. Insight and other psychosocial therapies as well as therapeutic communities had no overall impact.  Outpatient and voluntary treatments had significant impacts in reducing recidivism but prison based programs did not have an overall impact., Though these findings are encouraging in that they suggest that certain types of treatment can reduce offending, it should be noted that the quality of the studies was only moderate.  Nevertheless, unlike other research using non-equivalent comparison groups, it should be noted that non-equivalence works ‘against’ finding a program to be effective.  In this type of research, the treatment group is likely to include the worst offenders. Hence when comparisons are made with a ‘control’ group, the treatment group starts off being, if anything, worse than the comparison group., Conclusion: Overall it appears that treatments for sex offenders can be effective, though it would be wrong to conclude that any treatment will necessarily work.  It appears that voluntary cognitive-behavioural or classic behavioural treatments that take place in the community have shown the most success in the past., Reference: Lösel, Friedrich and Martin Schmucker (2005).  The Effectiveness of Treatment for Sexual Offenders: A Comprehensive Meta-Analysis.  Journal of Experimental Criminology, 1, 117-146., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV9N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-9-no-5-%E2%80%93-july-2008,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 9, No. 5 – July 2008",Regular Issue,2008
Whether or not men released from prison ‘go straight’ depends on the types of social obstacles and the disadvantages that they face in the community as well as their mindset as they leave prison.,", Most persistent offenders eventually stop offending (Criminological Highlights, V6N4#3).  There is little disagreement about the static predictors of recidivism among persistent offenders released from prison: e.g., age, gender, criminal history, and various family background factors.  Less is known about the importance of factors that are amenable to change when the offender reaches the community. These have often been categorized as being of two types: social factors (such as employment, addictions) and subjective factors (e.g., cognitive factors relating to choices, goals, values, motivations, etc.)., A major focus of this study was on the manner in which men, about to be released from prison, viewed their life chances in the community. A total of 130 male ‘career’ offenders in the UK were interviewed just before they were released from prison. The interview focused on their “aspirations and expectations for life after prison and what they saw as the chief stumbling blocks to desistance from further offending” (p. 140). They were questioned on such matters as whether they thought they could go straight, their regret about their past involvement in crime, whether they expected to find social prejudice in the community against ex-convicts, and whether they thought they could contribute positively to their families.   Four to six months after being released, the former inmates were re-interviewed.  This time the focus of the interview was on the problems they were experiencing in the community (e.g., being homeless or unemployed). Ten years later, 126 of the 127 men who were still alive were successfully traced through a variety of records to determine if they had been reconvicted or re-imprisoned., Those who, before being released, thought that they did not have the ability to go straight were more likely to experience large numbers of social problems 4-6 months after release from prison. The number of social problems (housing, employment, finances, relationships with partner/family, alcohol, drugs) that the offender was experiencing shortly after release from prison was a fairly robust predictor of re-offending and re-imprisonment.  But so also was the offender’s view, before being released, that society was prejudiced against ex-convicts and that this would make it difficult for him to go straight. “Regret for one’s past involvement in crime and self-identification as a ‘family man’ [seemed also] to contribute positively to the desistance process” (p. 154),, “The accumulation of [social problems such as homelessness and addiction]… seems to have a direct and powerful influence over one’s ability to go straight… [But in addition] measures of the mindset of men about to leave prison are at least marginally significant predictors of post-imprisonment outcomes as well” (p. 154)., Conclusion: “The findings provide some support for the importance of individual cognitions and meaning systems prior to release from prison….[suggesting] that subjective changes may precede life-changing structural events and, to that extent, individuals can act as agents of their own change” (p. 155).  Although social factors such as employment and housing had the strongest relationships with reconviction or re-imprisonment, “individual cognitions and meaning systems prior to release from prison” are clearly important., Reference: Lebel, Thomas P., Ros Burnett, Shadd Maruna, and Shawn Bushway (2008).

Courtrooms are designed in a fashion that has (purposefully?) led to the demise of the notion of the ‘public’ trial.,"Perhaps because of lawyers’ “obsession with the word” (p. 384) there has been little research on the internal space of the courtroom.  This paper argues that the configuration of the criminal courts, including such matters as the nature and height of various barriers, reflects a particular view of the role of the various participants. More specifically, this paper suggests that ‘the public’ has been marginalized by the architecture of the courtroom., Certain symbols are simple and their meaning is unambiguous. “When a royal coat of arms is placed behind a judge’s chair it makes clear that the full authority of the state and legitimate force is behind the judge” (p. 385). Such placement is not accidental: In England, for example, there is an 813 page guide on court standards and design that imposes a detailed template on designers of new courts. Less obvious than the placement of the coat of arms is the manner in which the space for the public has become more peripheral and contained over time. Indeed it is argued that as the role of the press has increased over the years, the role of the public has been diminished.  For example, while the author of this paper was sometimes questioned about taking notes, she never noticed members of the press being required to explain their note-taking., The design of courts suggests that courts are more concerned with the visibility of the spectators than they are with the visibility of the proceedings by the public.  One exception is that “spectators are expected to have a clear view of the judge but are destined to get no more than a ‘general view’ of the proceedings” (p. 396).  Indeed, English courts are designed so as to minimize the ability of the public to have direct eye contact with jurors, just as they are designed so as to make lawyers and accused almost unidentifiable. Courts are also designed to prevent the public from seeing the defendant while seated (p. 396).  When electronic screens are used to display evidence, they are often placed in a way that makes it impossible for the public to view the evidence.  In addition, it would appear that courthouses are constructed on the basis of fear of the public: the English guide to court architecture includes separate ‘zones’ for various groups, most of which are to restrict the accessibility of the public.  “The sophisticated forms of segregation and surveillance employed allow things to be arranged in such a way that the exercise of power is not added on from the outside but is subtly present in ways which increase its efficiency and transform spectators into docile bodies” (p. 399)., Conclusion. “Since the only person a member of the public is sure to have a clear view of is the judge, it would seem to be the case that the observation of justice is now limited to observation of the adjudicator rather than evaluation of evidence and the weight which should be afforded it.  It is process rather than substantive argument that the public is encouraged to observe” (p. 396). The author argues that “the use of space within the courtroom tells us much about the ideologies underpinning judicial process and power dynamics in the trial…. Perhaps most significantly it helps members of the judiciary to maintain control over who, and what, is likely to be heard” (p. 398)., Reference: Mulcahy, Linda (2007).

Is ‘fear of crime’ really a pressing problem for most people in western countries?,", The supervision of offenders on probation or parole has been an important part of corrections’ responsibility for over a century.  In both Canada and the United States, the portion of the total correctional population that is being supervised in the community far outnumbers the number in prison..  Yet a summary of 15 studies published in the past 30 years would suggests that, overall, community supervision per se or the amount of supervision has very little impact overall and perhaps no impact in reducing violent recidivism.  This paper attempts to understand why community supervision is so ineffective, and by implication, what can be done to increase its effectiveness., This paper starts from the principle that the first necessary step in creating effective community supervision is to identify those offenders being supervised in the community who have a reasonably high likelihood of reoffending in the first place.  There is no point in focusing resources on those offenders not in need of intervention.  The next step is to identify the goals of intervention – what the offender needs to change in order to reduce the likelihood of reoffending.  Finally, effective interventions have to be provided., In order to understand why probation services may not be effectively employed in ordinary probation supervision, a case study was carried out in Manitoba (Canada). Probation files were examined and audio recordings of probation officer-client meetings were made.  The goal was simple: do probation officers (in this jurisdiction) follow what is seen as good correctional practice?  There is no reason to believe that Manitoba probation officers were different in any important way from officers in other Canadian jurisdictions., Clients were seen during the first three months of probation an average of 4.3 times.  There was a very small relationship (r=0.22) for adults, but not for youth, between the ‘risk’ level of the client and the number of meetings with the probation officer. A risk assessment tool was generally administered, but for only 40% of the identified needs was there a corresponding intervention plan in place for the offender. The likelihood of an intervention plan being formulated appeared to vary with the need. For example, 80% of those identified as having a substance abuse problem had an action plan noted in their file. On the other hand, 40% of the adult offenders had employment problems noted, but only 10% of these cases had a verifiable action plan designed to address this problem.  But in addition, “Analysis of the audiotapes showed that identified criminogenic needs were not discussed in the majority of cases” (p. 267)., Conclusion. Since the data suggest that ‘ordinary’ community supervision has little impact on re-offending, is the only justification for probation the cost saving in comparison with incarceration?  This paper would suggest that before coming to that conclusion, one needs to implement, systematically, what is known about reducing offending.  “It is clear that probation officers can learn to do more and to do it better. [It has been] demonstrated that training in [various techniques] can make a difference and the beneficiaries of such training efforts will be the staff, the offenders and the community” (p. 268).

Community supervision programs are less effective than they could be in large part because probation officers do not adhere to basic principles of effective supervision.,", The supervision of offenders on probation or parole has been an important part of corrections’ responsibility for over a century.  In both Canada and the United States, the portion of the total correctional population that is being supervised in the community far outnumbers the number in prison..  Yet a summary of 15 studies published in the past 30 years would suggests that, overall, community supervision per se or the amount of supervision has very little impact overall and perhaps no impact in reducing violent recidivism.  This paper attempts to understand why community supervision is so ineffective, and by implication, what can be done to increase its effectiveness., This paper starts from the principle that the first necessary step in creating effective community supervision is to identify those offenders being supervised in the community who have a reasonably high likelihood of reoffending in the first place.  There is no point in focusing resources on those offenders not in need of intervention.  The next step is to identify the goals of intervention – what the offender needs to change in order to reduce the likelihood of reoffending.  Finally, effective interventions have to be provided., In order to understand why probation services may not be effectively employed in ordinary probation supervision, a case study was carried out in Manitoba (Canada).

There are ways of supervising offenders in the community that can be more effective than ordinary community supervision.,", Community supervision – both probation and parole – is often seen as consisting of an intertwining of law enforcement and social work modes of dealing with offenders. Large numbers of people in many countries are on some form of community supervision. In the U.S. there are about 6 million offenders on community supervision, about three times the number of people incarcerated in prisons and jails. Hence there is a need to determine what strategies are most effective in working with offenders in the community.  This study examined the difference in outcomes between a “nail ’em and jail ’em” (law enforcement model) and an approach which first identified criminogenic needs of offenders, developed case plans that responded to those needs, provided services that used social learning or cognitive behavioural interventions, and provided an appropriate learning environment for the offender in which the offender could learn prosocial behaviours and successfully complete supervision.  In sum, it tested whether this ‘Proactive Community Supervision’ (‘PCS’) model worked more effectively than a traditional model., The PCS approach required special (continuing) training for staff in, among other things, how to relate to the offenders they were supervising.  The purpose of offender-supervisor meetings was to share information and to assess, refine, and restate program goals. Performance measures were developed for staff and offenders, and attempts were made to change the organizations themselves to insure that they were supportive of the goals of PCS., A group of 274 PCS clients in four sites in the (U.S.) state of Maryland were compared to a matched set of controls receiving ordinary probation and parole supervision in four other sites.  Prior to the implementation of the PCS program, offenders in the PCS and control sites had been arrested at the same rates.   The PCS program was implemented reasonably effectively for the majority, but by no means all, of the clients., Looking at the groups as a whole, those clients who were assigned to receive PCS supervision (whether or not they actually received the full treatment) were less likely to be re-arrested (30%) than were the control clients (42%).  There were no significant differences in the number of technical violations (35% for the PCS group; 40% for the controls) which is somewhat surprising given that the PCS offenders had more contact with their supervisors., Conclusion. This example of a new generation of community supervision programs attempts to provide supervision staff with “tools of motivational enhancement, social learning environments, and targeted emphasis on core criminogenic needs” (p. 294), and moves away from a strict “accountability” (or enforcement) model.  The fact that it was successful in reducing re-arrests does not mean that any similar ‘treatment’ oriented program will also be effective. This was an integrated program in which, for example, treatment based interventions were focused on those moderate and high risk offenders most likely to benefit from them.  It appears to demonstrate that it is not ‘workload’ per se or the amount of attention given to the offender that is important. Instead, it appears to be the targeted nature of the community based interventions delivered in a “correctional milieu where offender change is supported” (p. 297) that had positive impacts on offenders., Reference: Taxman, Faye S.

"A commonly used ‘risk’ scale for youths is shown to predict recidivism for probationers but only for some youths and, for them, at a very low rate of accuracy.",", Identifying those young offenders who are likely to re-offend may be useful in part because the practice can, in theory, identify those youths who are in need of rehabilitative programs that address aspects of the youth’s life related to offending.  Generally speaking, formal risk assessments have been shown to be more accurate than subjective assessments of future risk.  This paper examines the predictive validity of the Youth Level of Service Case Management Inventory (YLS/CMI) which is “one of the most widely used risk assessment measures for youth” (p. 477)., All of the youths (n=328) in a Midwestern U.S. city who received sentences of probation for at least a year were assessed using this risk assessment tool. The main measure of recidivism was the presence of a new criminal charge during that year. The YLS/CMI assesses 8 domains (e.g., criminal history, family circumstances, education/ employment, substance use/ abuse, personality/ behaviour) on the basis of the youth’s responses to 42 interview questions., In this sample, 26% of the youths re-offended in the 12 month period.  Dividing the youths into three groups, 11% of the low risk, 26% of the moderate risk, and 39% of the high risk youths reoffended (differences that were statistically significant). On the surface, then, these results might be seen as encouraging, but if the purpose was to identify the ‘high risk’ offender, these results need to be examined more carefully.  In this study, 79 of the 328 youths in the study (24%) were identified as being ‘high risk.’  Even among these 79 ‘high risk’ youths – youths who had already been involved with the youth justice system and who were assessed as being high risk –  the measure correctly identified only 31 of them. Said differently, 48 of these 79 youths were assessed as being high risk, but did not re-offend.   The fact that something is ‘statistically significant’ does not, obviously, guarantee that it is highly accurate., Other findings also limit the usefulness of the measure.  There was a significant correlation between the YLS/CMI score and the number of charges for white youths.  However, for girls the YLS/CMI score was not a significant predictor of recidivism. Nor was it a significant predictor of recidivism for youths identifying themselves as African Americans or of Hispanic/ Latino background., Conclusion.  This study serves as a reminder of the problems we have in predicting recidivism for youths. “Cumulative YLS/CMI scores explained a relatively small amount of the recidivism rate between offenders” (p. 482).  In other words, although there was a significant relationship between the ‘risk’ scores and actual re-offending, the size of the relationship was so small that it may not be of practical use.  Furthermore, the lack of a significant relationship for girls, African Americans and youths of Hispanic/ Latino background lends support to the conclusion that such measures may be of very limited practical use in a youth justice system., Reference:  Onifade, Eyitayo, William Davidson, Christina Campbell, Garrett Turke, Jill Malinowski, and Kimberly Turner (2008).

Growing up in severely disadvantaged neighbourhoods is associated with behaviour problems for boys just as they start school.,", It is well established that children who grow up in poor families are at heightened risk for behaviour problems and involvement in crime.  But in addition to the characteristics of their own families, there are reasons to believe that young children in poor neighbourhoods may be especially at risk, since these neighbourhoods may be more likely to be characterized by conditions (e.g., large numbers of unsupervised youths) associated with offending.  This study looks at the impact of neighbourhood disadvantage on the behaviour of boys during early childhood., Mothers who were participants in a monetary and nutritional support program for children in low-income families were recruited at a time when they had a boy who was about 1-1.5 years old. The mothers were interviewed four times, the last time when this child was about 6 years old.  The level of economic disadvantage for each family’s neighbourhood was estimated from census data.  An index of neighbourhood disadvantage was created from a combination of economic characteristics as well as the proportion of single mother households and households headed by people with relatively low levels of education.  Behaviour problems were assessed by questions such as whether the boy “gets in many fights,” “physically attacks people,” or “has temper tantrums or a hot temper.”, Obviously, mothers and children who, themselves, were disadvantaged tended to live in disadvantaged neighbourhoods.  And boys who showed behaviour problems when they were very young were more likely to show behaviour problems when they were six.  However, above and beyond these factors and various other controls, coming from a relatively disadvantaged neighbourhood was associated with high levels of behaviour problems for the six year-old boys.  It also appeared that the effect of neighbourhood disadvantage was not linear.  As neighbourhood disadvantage increased, there was no impact on behaviour problems until a threshold was reached.  Above that point, behaviour problems were considerably higher, but additional increases in neighbourhood disadvantage had no impact. Interestingly, however, neighbourhood disadvantage was not associated with overt behaviour problems reported by the mothers prior to age 6. Instead, these problems emerged around the time of the transition to school., Conclusion. The fact that relatively severe neighbourhood disadvantage affected boys’ behaviour at age six, above and beyond characteristics of the youth and the family, suggests that focusing resources on those living in especially disadvantaged neighbourhoods can have a multiplicative impact on boys as they move from home to school. Those receiving the benefits of an economic support program will be helped as will those who live in a neighbourhood that, overall, is no longer severely disadvantaged. If society were interested in reducing school violence or aggression, it might want to focus resources on those severely disadvantaged neighbourhoods from which its problem children are likely to come., Reference: Winslow, Emily B. and Daniel S.

Statutes that require or advise police to arrest suspects in domestic violence incidents increase the likelihood of arrest not only in those cases but also in incidents with other victim-offender relationships.,", Over the past 30 years, there have been changes in the laws governing the arrest of suspects in domestic violence incidents in many jurisdictions. For example, in the U.S., some states allow police  the same discretion that is allowed in any other criminal case, while others have laws that instruct police that they must arrest. Other states instruct police that arrest is the preferred outcome.  Concern has been expressed about possible ‘dual arrest’ outcomes of such laws – in which both partners are arrested when there is an allegation of violence from both .  The rate of ‘dual arrest’ outcomes has been reported to be as high as 23% in some studies and as low 5% in others.  This study examines the impact of mandatory and preferred arrest laws on arrest not only in domestic violence cases, but also in assaults involving other victim-offender relationships., The data that were examined were from police ‘incident reports’ in 8 states with mandatory arrest statutes, 4 states with preferred arrest laws, and 7 states with ordinary ‘discretionary’ laws.  Four types of violent incidents were examined: those in which the violence occurred between intimate partners, those which involved other domestic relationships (e.g., parent child), those in which the relationship was non-domestic but the partners were known to each other (e.g., acquaintances, friends, neighbours), and strangers.  In general, pooling across all states and police departments, arrest was more common in intimate partner assaults (50%) than in the other three groups (Other domestic: 45%; Non-Domestic, known: 29%; Stranger: 35%), The findings suggest that the highest rate of arrest for domestic assaults was to be found in the incidents that took place in a ‘preferred arrest’ location.  But arrest was also considerably more likely in the ‘mandatory arrest’ locations than in the states in which the decision was left to the discretion of the police officer. The effect of mandatory and preferred arrest laws for domestic violence appears to have had a ‘spillover’ effect on other domestic, acquaintance, and stranger cases.  In locations in which arrest was the preferred or ‘mandatory’ outcome for domestic violence cases, arrest was also more likely in other types of violence., Dual arrests were rare. Only 1.9% of intimate partner incidents resulted in both partners being arrested, though this rate was slightly higher than in other domestic incidents (1.5%), acquaintance (1%) and stranger incidents (0.4%).  There was, however, a good deal of variation across and within states. Mandatory arrest policies increased the likelihood of dual arrests compared to locations in which complete discretion was with the police officers.  Mandatory arrest laws also, however, increased the likelihood of arrest for other domestic cases and cases involving acquaintances. Preferred arrest policies, however, did not increase the likelihood of dual arrest., Conclusion.  Mandatory and preferred arrest policies clearly have an impact. “Both higher overall arrest rates and higher dual arrest rates are associated with mandatory domestic violence arrest laws” (p. 297).  However, preferred arrest laws only had an impact on arrest of the primary offender and not on the rate of dual arrests.  None of these findings, however, relate to another important issue: victim safety and reduced re-offending., Reference: Hirschel, David, Eve Buzawa, April Pattavina and Don Faggiani (2008).

The suggestion that the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion was responsible for part of the crime drop in the U.S. in the 1990s is almost certainly wrong.,", A 2001 study by Donohue and Levitt – popularized by Levitt in his book Freakonomics – suggests that the legalization of abortion in the U.S. in 1973 contributed to the 1990s crime reduction. They suggested that those women who are most ‘at risk’ of having children who are likely to offend – the poor, the young, the unmarried – are, through the availability of abortion, likely to avoid giving birth to future offenders. 
 
One could infer from the “abortion hypothesis” that there should be a decline in the birthrate of so- called ‘at risk’ women after 1973 if the legalizing of abortion had a special effect on them.  This study looks at the number of births to 15-19 year olds, the birth rate of unmarried women, and the percent of all births to unmarried women for the period 1940 to 2003.  The Donohue-Levitt hypothesis would suggest that each of these should have declined immediately or soon after the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade., The data do not support the hypothesized mechanism for the crime decline. The number of births to 15-19 year olds peaked in the mid-to-late 1960s and was clearly on the decline prior to 1973.  The birth rate for unmarried women increased more or less steadily from 1940 until the mid-1980s, though for the ten year period starting around 1968 the birth rate for unmarried women was fairly constant.  Furthermore the percent of births to unmarried women increased steadily from the early 1950s until 2004. Hence there is no evidence supporting the hypothesized mechanism suggested by Donohue and Levitt., Demographic changes in a country have not generally been shown to have much effect on crime (e.g., Criminological Highlights, V2N6#7; V5N4#4). The findings in this paper are similar to those reported by Franklin Zimring (2007) in his book The Great American Crime Decline. He points out that what actually occurred - increases in the number of children born to ‘at risk’ mothers - would be expected to increase, not decrease, crime. Indeed, as Zimring notes in his 2005 book American Juvenile Justice, three prominent criminologists in the early 1990s predicted that demographic changes would create thousands more muggers and killers (James Q. Wilson), hundreds of thousands more ‘super-predators’ (John Dilulio) and a ‘blood bath’ (James A. Fox). In reality, none of this happened: crime went down, and the number of ‘at risk’ youth also went up. Zimring (2007) also presents data from other countries, including Canada, that are not consistent with the ‘abortion effect’ hypothesis. It would appear that demographically-based hypotheses such as this one do not adequately explain actual changes in crime rates., Conclusion.  “The invalidation of the [American] anti-abortion laws had no discernable impact on the fertility levels of women at risk for giving birth to felonious children” (p. 144).  Various models of possible impact of the court decision were assessed and none of them showed the hypothesized effect.  Foote and Goetz in a paper first circulated in 2005 challenge the Donohue-Levitt findings on a different dimension. They demonstrate that Donohue and Levitt’s published findings did not contain the controls that they say they used. When these controls were included, the ‘abortion effect’ first presented by Donohue and Levitt effectively disappeared. The data presented in the current paper, then, support the conclusion that others have come to: liberalized abortion laws had little if any effect on crime., Reference:  Chamblin, Mitchell B., Andrew J.

"After-school programs can be effective in reducing crime, but many such programs are not.","Parents and policy makers often worry about what youths do after school and before they go home. Often the assumption is that almost any after-school program will be effective in reducing crime.  Poorly executed research supports this notion in large part because if it focuses on those who voluntarily attend such programs, these are the youth who often are motivated to keep out of trouble., Experimental research, however, has shown that only some programs are effective in reducing crime.  Whether a program reduces offending appears to relate, to some extent, to the content and the intensity of the program.  Previous research has suggested that programs focusing on social skills and character development, as well as smaller, more intensive, structured programs are more likely to reduce crime than programs that simply involve youths in various activities. Findings such as these are important, because it has occasionally been found that certain programs tend to increase youths’ involvement in crime., This study examines 35 after-school programs in Maryland. Self-report measures of involvement in drug use (the frequency with which participants had used various drugs) and delinquency (whether the youth had engaged in a variety of delinquent acts) were obtained.  The main analyses were designed to determine which programs were most likely to reduce substance use and involvement in delinquent behaviours.  A number of factors appeared to predict program effectiveness., It is, perhaps, not surprising that “the use of published curricula, an alternative measure of program structure, produced significant reductions in substance use” (p. 310), nor is it surprising that programs with a more educated staff were more likely to be effective.  It may be that a higher proportion of male staff running the program was associated with maintaining order in the program.  The overall view that one gets is that more ‘professional’ programs (those with structured curriculum, educated male staff) were more likely to be effective in part because it was clear that these programs had a clear agenda and focused activities rather than simply filling the after-school hours with something that appeared to be good., Conclusion.  All programs designed to address delinquency are not equal.  Simply engaging youths in any activity does not necessarily have long term favourable consequences. In some communities, governments simply fund ‘programs’ without much attention paid to exactly what it is they are funding.  Poorly organized programs, implemented without care, with non-professional staff would, it seems, be likely to lead to poor outcomes on a number of dimensions.   The political challenge is not only to fund, and continuously evaluate, ‘effective programs’ but also to have the courage to stop funding programs simply because they ‘look good.’, Reference: Gottfredson, Denise C., Cross, Amanda, and Soulé, David A.

A high rate of arrests for minor offences was associated with a small reduction in violent crime in New York City in the 1990s.,", New York City politicians and police officials have made themselves famous by suggesting that police policies that gave priority to “aggressively targeting so-called quality-of-life offences and arresting violators for vagrancy, loitering, prostitution, littering [and other minor offences]” (p. 356)” were responsible for the reduction in serious crime that occurred in New York in the 1990s.  The underlying theory was that arresting people for these matters “sends a message… that police are paying attention and will enforce community standards” (p. 356).  Though few deny the fact that recorded crime in New York dropped, people disagree about whether order maintenance policing (OMP) was responsible for this drop., A previous study (see Criminological Highlights V8N4#1) suggested that the apparent drop in overall violence was due to the fact that those locations in New York City with the biggest increase in crime in the late 1980s had the highest rate of OMP and the largest drop in crime. The suggestion was that the reduction was not due to the OMP but rather was a result of ‘mean reversion’:  what goes up also comes down.  This paper looks at two specific crimes – homicide and robbery – in part because rates of other violent crime (e.g., rape and assault) are more susceptible to problems of measurement. In addition, it used a different indicator of OMP – one that included violations of city ordinances as well as misdemeanours.  In addition, other controls and somewhat different statistical techniques were used., It is no wonder that New York City politicians claimed to have solved the crime problem: between 1990 and 2001, robbery and homicide rates dropped by about 76%.  Though crime started dropping dramatically after 1990, the OMP arrests did not start increasing until 1994, levelling out in 1997. Nevertheless, the analysis presented in this paper suggests that there was a small impact of OMP on both homicide rate and robbery rate even after various relevant controls (e.g., amount of disorder, number of police officers, 1988 robbery or homicide rate) were taken into account statistically., OMP activities were greatest, not surprisingly, in precincts with high growth in disorder (as measured by citizen complaints), number of police officers, drug use (measured by cocaine deaths) and high rates of felony arrests as well as in precincts with higher proportions of blacks and disadvantaged residents., It appears that high rates of OMP were responsible for some of the decline in homicide and robbery rates. The decline in homicide and robbery rates was large: from 120 robberies per 100K residents in 1988 to 31.1 in 2001, and from 26.7 homicides per 100K residents in 1988 to 7.6 in 2001.  OMP was estimated to have been responsible for some of this decline, but not a lot: about 4% of the decline in robbery rates and about 10% of the decline in homicide rates are estimated to be attributable to the increase in OMP., Conclusion. It appears that those precincts that implemented Order Maintenance Policing (OMP) faithfully were more likely to experience declines in homicide and robbery than were those precincts in which this policy was implemented less thoroughly. It is possible, of course, that these same precincts more faithfully implemented other policies that related to crime.  What is clear, however, is that if OMP did have an impact, it was not responsible for most of the drop in crime in New York City., Reference: Rosenfeld, Richard, Fornango, Robert, and Rengifo, Andres F.

Black male offenders who are released from prison are more likely to re-offend when they re-enter communities with high levels of racial inequality.,", Research on offences committed by those released from prison has largely focused on the characteristics of those who are being released.  At the same time, there is an increasing amount of research that suggests that, above and beyond the characteristics of an individual, the characteristics of a neighbourhood are important in understanding crime rates (see, for example, Criminological Highlights, V1N1#2, V8N1#5, V8N5#3).  Combining these two sets of findings would suggest that the nature of the communities that prisoners return to may be important in understanding whether they re-offend. 
 
This study focuses on a group with a high risk of recidivism – Black males – and addresses the question of whether recidivism rates for this group are highest when they return to communities with high levels of racial inequality.  African Americans comprise about 13% of the U.S. population, but they make up nearly half of the U.S. prison population and nearly half of the offenders being released from prison. When released, their recidivism rates are somewhat higher than for other groups.  One explanation for at least part of this higher rate might be that they are released into communities with high levels of poverty, inequality and crime (all factors that may promote recidivism)., This study looked at recidivism (defined as reconviction within a 2-year period) for 34,868 inmates (21,484 of them Black) who were released into 62 different Florida counties. Racial inequality was measured by examining the relative incomes, joblessness rates and poverty rates of Blacks and Whites in each county.  Economic deprivation (across groups) was also examined, as were other characteristics of the counties such as (reported) crime rates, and the number of police officers per 100,000 residents. Characteristics of the individual offenders (e.g., criminal record and incarceration history) were also measured (in order to control for these factors)., Counties with high levels of racial inequality were more likely to have high Black recidivism.  When the control variables were added to the analysis, the racial inequality of the county remained associated with higher recidivism rates. Obviously other individual factors (e.g., being young or having an extensive criminal record) also predicted recidivism. Interestingly, however, there was evidence that “racial inequality amplified the effects of criminal history on reconviction” (p. 427).   However, as expected, racial inequality was not associated with white recidivism., Conclusion. “Prisoners are not released into a social vacuum…. The ability of released prisoners to desist from crime is affected not only by their own attributes, but by the characteristics of the broader social context they re-enter” (p. 427).  “Black male recidivism is one cost society pays for racial inequality” (p. 428).  Other findings suggest that it is inequality rather than absolute deprivation that is related to high rates of recidivism by Blacks. Since the relative ability of Blacks to get jobs and earn a satisfactory income is an important determinant of recidivism, the findings suggest that it is important to examine broad social policies, in addition to the characteristics of individuals, when trying to understand crime., Reference: Reisig, Michael D., Bales, William D., Hay, Carter, and Wang, Xia (2007).

We know enough about why people are convicted for crimes they did not commit to do something about it.,", The first systematic attempt to understand why innocent people are convicted of criminal offences was published 75 years ago (Edwin Borchard Convicting the Innocent, 1932).  Since that time, it has become clear in virtually all Anglo-based criminal justice systems that wrongful convictions are a predictable part of the operation of those criminal justice systems. The moratorium on executions declared by an Illinois governor in 2000 after an inmate was shown to be innocent 2 days before his scheduled execution date is but one high profile example of the scope of the problem., Among the more frequent factors leading to wrongful convictions are the following. Often two or more factors combine to increase the likelihood of a wrongful conviction., Conclusion.  “Cases of wrongful conviction are invariably rooted in systemic failures….” (p. 483).  The causes cross “diverse legal, political, and social environments.”   In order to address wrongful convictions one has to look at the immediate causes (e.g., mis-identification, dishonest testimony from a jailhouse informer,  or false confessions) as well as the “environment that allows them to occur in the first place” such as “public pressures and intense media assaults on a case”  (p. 485).  In order to reduce the number of wrongful convictions, changes need to be made in “the way we investigate, prosecute, defend, and try criminal cases” (p. 486)., Reference: Macfarlane, Bruce (2006).

"A series of police scandals in Japan led to a change in the manner in which crime was officially recorded by police, which in turn led to the ‘myth of the collapse of a secure society’ and increasingly punitive public views and policies.",", Until the late 1990s, crime was not an important public issue in Japan. At the end of the 1990s, however, two incidents in which victims had asked for police assistance, but did not receive it, and subsequently were murdered, changed the salience and importance of crime as a public policy issue., One reaction to these events was that starting in 2000, a national police policy was created that required all crime incidents that came to the attention of the police to be recorded by them. As a result, the number of crime incidents recorded by the police doubled between 1999 and 2000 and by 2004 was more than 5 times the number it had been between 1992 and 1999. The increases in recorded crime were disproportionately in the recording of minor crimes.  With respect to violent crime, just under 30,000 offences were recorded by the police in 1999. By 2002, this number had increased to almost 50,000.  Almost all of the increase in violent crime involved persons who were ‘slightly injured.’  There was little, if any, increase in the number of those recorded by the police as having been ‘severely injured.’ There were also no substantial changes in the number of murders or the broader category of ‘deaths as a result of any kind of violent act.’  The 2000 International Crime Victims Surveys found that Japan had the lowest violent victimization rate and the second lowest rate for burglaries of all participating countries. Furthermore, according to the victimization study, between 2000 and 2004, the rates of 3 categories of violent crime and 6 categories of property crime decreased or remained stable.  There were increases in only 2 categories of crime - thefts from cars and attempted burglary. Nevertheless, fear of crime went up dramatically between 2000 and 2004., The press interpreted the increase in police-recorded crime as reflecting actual changes in crime notwithstanding the fact that it was known that the policy had changed and that there was no change in the number of murders or deaths as a result of any kind of violent act. The number of newspaper stories using  the words ‘heinous and murder’ or ‘crime and victim’ increased dramatically. “This moral panic has been extremely durable and lasted for [at least the first five years of this century] ” (p. 170)., Two laws were enacted in 2004, one which focused on victims and “notes in its preface that the risk of becoming a victim of crime is now increasing for ordinary Japanese citizens” (p. 171). It did not point out that it was only the risk of being recorded by the police as a victim that was increasing.  The second change in the criminal law increased minimum and maximum sentences for violent crime based on “demands from victims of crime and [the] belief in deterrent effects” (p. 171).  Prison populations, which had been increasing somewhat prior to 2000 increased from about 50,000 in 2000 to almost 70,000 in 2005 (Japan’s population is about 127.4 million.), Conclusion. Although it would appear that Japan, compared to most western countries, has a very low crime rate, “the Japanese public has low confidence in its safety, a high level of fear of crime, and a very punitive attitude toward offenders.  The high level of media focus on rising recorded crime and a campaign for victims’ rights have contributed to these findings…. Criminal justice agencies, especially the police and the public prosecutors office have gradually lost their discretion in using informal procedures….” (p. 174)., Reference: Hamai, Koichi and Ellis, Thomas (2006).  Crime and Criminal Justice in Modern Japan: From Re-integrative Shaming to Popular Punitivism.  International Journal of the Sociology of Law, 34, 157-178., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV9N11.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-9-no-1-%E2%80%93-september-2007,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 9, No. 1 – September 2007",Regular Issue,2007
"Jurors in at least one long complex fraud case appear to have been able to understand and evaluate the evidence that was presented to them. They could have used some help, however, with practical matters.",", The Jubilee Line case in England – a case involving multiple charges of corruption and conspiracy to defraud against 5 defendants in relation to large construction contracts for the London Underground – ended in March 2005 after 21 months of hearings without going to the jury for a decision.  This case is often cited when the suggestion is made that certain kinds of cases need to be heard by a judge sitting without a jury., Previous research has shown that members of English and New Zealand juries take their jobs seriously. When asked about any problems they encountered as jurors, they generally only cite such problems as practical employment issues (losing one’s job or source of income) or poor treatment by the courts.  Simulation studies suggest that most individual jurors are quite competent in major fraud trials.  The problems that do arise appear to relate to the manner in which evidence is presented to them. In addition, there is evidence that juror competence can easily be improved if certain simple practices (e.g., note taking or discussion amongst jurors) were encouraged., In the Jubilee Line case, interviews were carried out with all of the jurors after the case was aborted.  The jurors themselves were adamant they “had a very good understanding of the evidence” (p. 259). Furthermore, the interviews revealed that a year after the case was aborted, they “displayed quite impressive familiarity with the charges, issues and evidence…”(p. 259), though there was obviously some variability across jurors. These results are consistent with other studies of jurors’ understanding of evidence (Criminological Highlights, V2N2#8).  Those jurors who had difficulty were able to rely on other jurors (e.g., those who took copious notes) for information. The jurors discussed evidence and witnesses frequently “and were unanimous that the understanding of the jury as a whole was greatly enhanced thereby” (p. 261).  They found their ability to ask questions to be helpful. Note taking was seen generally as helpful, though only some jurors took notes (and they varied in the detail of their notes). The main problem faced by the jurors with respect to the actual trial was not in understanding the evidence, but the slow pace and tediousness of the trial - in particular, some of the questioning by the defence.  The jurors were unclear – as were, it turned out, some of the barristers – as to what the relevance of certain evidence was., The most serious problems faced by the jurors related to the fact that the trial took so long.  There were special compensation rules in place for this jury but the rules relating to such matters as lost overtime, increments, or bonuses were never made clear to them.  The jurors who were employed indicated that their employers were unhappy with the long trial; yet the court was unwilling to communicate directly with employers.  A related problem was the court’s inability or unwillingness to communicate adequately when the jury would be needed. Jurors wasted enormous amounts of time travelling to court when they were not needed. More generally, it appeared that the court was unwilling to address systematically the problems for jurors of being involved in long trials. Essentially nobody considered adequately the impact of the trial on the jurors’ lives.  Perhaps the largest insult to the jurors was their perception that they were treated as “jury fodder” – “on tap, but not informed” of what was happening (p. 265).   On the day that the prosecution conceded that the trial was no longer viable, they were at court. They waited 5 hours before they were brought into the court and formally discharged by the judge with no explanation as to what had happened.  It was clear to the jurors that everyone in the courtroom except them knew what had happened. They only learned about the details (that the defendants had been acquitted) on the evening news, and some of that news implied that the trial had collapsed because of problems with them – the jury (which was not true)., Conclusion. It would appear that courts could, if they wished, make it much easier for jurors in long trials.   Cases like this one were found not to be overly complex nor was the evidence beyond the capability of the jurors to understand. Comprehension and memory problems were easily overcome by the fact that the jury acted as a group. Many of the practical problems for jurors could be overcome if the courts were more respectful of the jurors as participants in the criminal justice process rather than treating them as ‘jury fodder’., Reference: Lloyd-Bostock, Sally (2007).  The Jubilee Line Jurors: Does their Experience Strengthen the Argument for Judge-only Trial in Long and Complex Fraud Cases?

The sentence of “life imprisonment without parole” creates a new set of problems that need to be considered.,", As the use of capital punishment declines throughout the world, the possibility exists that it will be replaced with life imprisonment without eligibility for parole.  In the United States, in particular, the availability of such sentences appears to be increasing for adults and for youths. Indeed it would appear that there are only two states in the U.S. in which this is not a sentencing option for at least some cases.  Typically, it is used as the alternative to capital punishment., It is currently estimated that approximately 3% of the U.S. prison population is serving a sentence of life without parole (LWOP).  Sweden and Bulgaria have the possibility of sentences of LWOP (although in each it is possible to petition the government for a pardon) and since 1990, the United Kingdom joined the group of countries that impose LWOP.  At the other end of the spectrum, five European countries have no life sentences, though offenders may spend as long or longer in prison as offenders in countries with life sentences that include the possibility of parole., There are a number of arguments in favour of LWOP.  These include the following:, Conclusion.  The decision to shift from the death penalty or sentences that assume a possibility of returning to the community to life without parole is more than a simple change in the size of the maximum penalty available for an offender.  Life without parole raises a whole new set of questions and concerns that should be addressed., Reference: Appleton, Catherine and Grøver, Bent (2007).

Being part of an intact family in domestic violence cases affects sentencing.,", There is a good deal of research that suggests that judges consider the nature of family relationships when sentencing offenders.  Some research in the 1980s, for example, suggests that judges were particularly lenient with women who were in family relationships. The suggestion was that “Leniency toward female offenders is not mere paternalism on the part of judges, but instead reflected a state-based concern with ensuring the availability of intact families, caretaking labour and child rearing” (p. 656)., This study looks at sentencing patterns in a specialized domestic violence court in Toronto.  This court was designed “to improve the criminal justice response to intimate partner violence and related crimes by relying on a coordinated community response model” (p. 660). The prosecutors in this court “are committed to a more vigorous prosecution of cases and to increased cooperation with police divisions so as to improve the quality of investigations and increase the number of successful outcomes [convictions]” (p. 660). Various attempts are made to keep victim/witnesses informed and involved in the process.  The focus of the study is on whether those found guilty were sentenced to prison and if so, for how long. A number of standard ‘control’ variables were also included (e.g., various offender and offence characteristics)., Not surprisingly, two offender characteristics were important determinants of the decision to sentence an offender to prison: unemployed offenders were more likely to be sent to prison as were those with prior convictions for domestic assaults.  More interesting is the fact that whether or not the family was intact at the time of the incident and whether there were children in the family were not, on their, own, significant predictors of whether the offender was sentenced to prison.  However, a prison sentence was most likely to be handed down in those cases that had a combination of an intact family and in which the victim suffered a serious injury. This suggests that the nature of the relationship between victim and offender was important in the decision to sentence the offender to prison, but only in cases in which there was a serious injury., However, for offenders who were sentenced to prison, those who were in an intact relationship at the time of the incident received shorter sentences.  Offenders with children received longer sentences as did, not surprisingly, those who had caused serious injuries. Unemployed offenders and those with records of domestic violence also received longer sentences., Conclusion. It would appear that “courts are more likely to incarcerate offenders in intact relationships when the victim has suffered serious injuries… yet at the same time, courts appear to be reluctant to break apart these families for too long, with offenders in intact relationships receiving shorter sentences than offenders estranged from their victims, even controlling for the presence of injury” (p. 666).  Employed (male) offenders also received shorter sentences, suggesting that the courts are responding, to some extent, to the immediate interests of the family., Reference: Dinovitzer, Ronit and Dawson, Myrna (2007).

"Although the majority of victims of crime may prefer not to file victim impact statements, such statements may be of value to those who decide to give their views of their own victimization.","In the past few decades, the role of victims in the criminal process has become politicized. The suggestion is often made that ‘giving to victims’ means ‘taking from offenders’ –  as if being respectful and responsive to one group necessitated being rude and unfair to another.  The British government, for example, announced recently that it was going to “rebalance the criminal justice system in favour of the victim and the law abiding majority” (p. 361) implying that something needed to be taken from the accused in order to ‘give’ to the victim., In contrast to this approach, in 2000, the Scottish executive focused its concern about victims on “better access to information for victims, improved support and greater participation in the criminal process” (p. 361).  On a trial basis (in some locations), victims of all offences against the person (including all assaults) and theft by housebreaking were offered the opportunity to make a statement about the impact of the crime, not an opinion about what the outcome (e.g., the sentence) should be.  This paper summarizes the findings from a study of the Scottish experience based on interviews with victims after the case was over., Conclusion:  It appears that victim impact statements can be integrated into the justice system in such a way that most victims who file statements see a value in doing so. Costs were relatively low because the statement information was mailed to the victim and returned by mail. Criminal justice professionals did not perceive unfairness to the accused as the result. “There is no evidence from the Scottish evaluation that the truth seeking function of the criminal justice system was compromised by victim statements” (p. 379).  Although relatively few victims may take advantage of the opportunity to have their experiences described to the court, those who do appear to appreciate the opportunity., Reference: Chalmers, James, Peter Duff, and Fiona Leverick (2007).

"Boot camps might not work, but studies of programs that take place after inmates finish boot camp suggest that the aftercare component of these programs can reduce subsequent offending.",", Most offenders who enter prisons return to their communities.  In countries with high incarceration rates, this simple fact raises an important issue: what can be done with ex-prisoners when they return to the community to help them desist from crime? Ex-prisoners face a number of special obstacles to abstaining from crime. Most ‘after-care’ programs for ex-prisoners in the U.S. emphasize surveillance and public protection rather than service for the offender., This paper examines a post-release ‘re-entry’ program for inmates who had served 6 month sentences in a Pennsylvania boot camp.  The program involved 90 days of residential aftercare which included cognitive behaviour therapy, job readiness and job acquisition skills, and substance abuse counselling. In most instances, individual treatment plans were developed and executed.  In March 2002, a new policy mandated that all of those released from the boot camp would receive this program.  Those who went through the program immediately prior to March 2002 served as a comparison group (n=383) and were compared to those who had the new treatment immediately after the change in policy (n=337). The two groups did not differ on any major demographic variables (e.g., age, education level, offence, prior arrests).  There were some minor differences between the two groups on some attitude measures (taken as they completed their term of incarceration).  These differences were controlled statistically in the recidivism analyses., Aftercare services were provided by 23 different accredited providers, and program content varied somewhat across providers. Nevertheless, there were no differences in recidivism rates across program providers; hence results cannot be attributed to special characteristics of one provider. Recidivism was measured by arrest for a new crime within two years.  At the end of a two-year period following release from the boot camp, 33% of the untreated control group had been arrested in comparison with only 22% of the treatment group. It could be argued that those in the aftercare program were not as much at risk during the program because they were in a rather structured environment for 90 days of the 2-year follow-up.  The analysis was repeated, therefore, using release from the boot camp as the starting point for the control group and release from the aftercare program for the ‘aftercare’ group.   The results were essentially the same., Conclusion:  Structured aftercare, focusing on the needs of offenders on release, clearly had an impact on subsequent offending.  Although these (effective) programs differed from one another, “they all were accredited programs, all but one used individual treatment plans and all provided a vast array of services from employment and social skills to drug and alcohol rehabilitation and counselling.  Therefore, this finding does not imply that simply extending the period of supervision for ex-inmates without providing extended services should reduce recidivism” (p. 380)., Reference: Kurlychek, Megan and Cynthia Kempinen (2006).  Beyond Boot Camp: The Impact of Aftercare on Offender Re-entry.  Criminology and Public Policy, 5 (2), 363-388., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV9N2.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-9-no-2-%E2%80%93-december-2007,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 9, No. 2 – December 2007",Regular Issue,2007
Counties in Florida that increased the size of their prison populations received no benefit in terms of a reduction in local crime rates.,", Studies which try to estimate the impact of imprisonment on crime rates have used different methods and have arrived at somewhat different findings. A major problem these studies face is estimating the annual number of crimes an offender would commit if he or she remained on the street.  Another problem is that imprisonment policies in neighbouring jurisdictions could have an impact on a jurisdiction’s crime rate if offenders move around a lot.  Data on arrests, however, suggest that few offenders move very far from home when they offend., This study looks at variation in incarceration rates across counties in Florida. Changes in crime rates and in imprisonment rates in Florida are similar to those in the U.S. as a whole.  The ‘imprisonment’ measure was the number of people sentenced to prison for a year or more in the county (for crimes committed in that county).  County crime rates were measured by the seven ‘index crimes’ (homicide, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, larceny, auto theft) each of which was analyzed separately. Various factors were controlled statistically: the age distribution of the county, % Black, poverty rate, per capita income, % unemployed, % divorced, and % female-headed households with children., “The basic finding… is that county-level prison population growth seems to have little or no significant relationship with county-level crime rates, at least not in Florida” (p. 227).  Although none of the effects of imprisonment rates on crime are significant, they are all in the predicted direction (more imprisonment, less crime).  “Most crime reduction occurs for property crimes” (p. 229), but even then the effect is rather small – “slightly over one index crime per year per additional prisoner” (p. 229) – and as noted not statistically significant., The study considered the possibility that the effect of imprisonment on crime within counties is not strong in part because it does not take into account imprisonment in nearby counties.  An analysis including imprisonment rates in nearby counties suggests that “nearby prison population has no impact on in-county crime” (p. 234)., Conclusion: “This study finds no support for the ‘more prisoners, less crime’ thesis” (p. 234).  One possible explanation for this could be that “As the prison population [of a community] expands, its potential impact on crime may decrease as lower-rate offenders are included in the expansion.  Thus, incarcerating serious high-rate offenders may reduce crime, but expanding incarceration to include less-serious lower-rate offenders will produce small reductions in crime” (p. 235)., Reference: Kovandzic, Tomislav V. and Lynne M.

"Even sensible sounding programs taking place in prisons can be harmful: An innovative, short-term, prison-based re-entry program increased recidivism.",", Given that most prisoners eventually are released, it makes intuitive sense to focus at least part of prison treatment program resources on helping offenders re-enter society. On the other hand, it is not clear what the essential elements of a prison-based re-entry program should be., Generally, however, there seems to be agreement that effective prison treatments would have the following characteristics: they should address dynamic risk factors (i.e., factors in the prisoners’ lives that can be changed); they should employ cognitive-behavioural, skills oriented, or multimodal treatment approaches; they should focus on the needs of the participants; and the implementation should be well supported and professionally administered., Project Greenlight was designed to incorporate various programs while the offender was still in prison and to provide links to families, service providers, and parole officers after release.  As with many ‘modern’ correctional programs, there was a cognitive skills component. “A substantial portion of the intervention was focused on addressing key measures such as employment, housing, drug relapse prevention….  Inmates also participated in sessions that focused on practical living skills…[such as] how to use public transportation, budgeting,… where to get emergency cash or non-cash assistance when money is scarce” (p. 308)., Eligible inmates were identified 75-105 days prior to release and were transferred to a particular facility in which the program was administered.  Two comparison groups were identified: those who met the same criteria but were not transferred to the facility (because of inadequate space), and those transferred but for whom space in the ‘Greenlight’ program did not exist.  The three groups did not differ on demographic or criminal justice history measures., Inmates were followed for two years after release.  Whether one looks at total arrests, felony arrests, or revocations of release for any reason, the results are quite clear: the Greenlight program was associated with an increased likelihood of recidivism, not decreased recidivism as had been hoped and expected., Conclusion:  Obviously it is surprising that a program designed to ease offenders back into the community would be associated with increased recidivism.  Why this is the case is not clear.  Explanations such as the program sessions having more than ideal numbers in them might explain effectiveness, but do less well explaining the harmful effects.  It is possible, however, that the actual implementation of the program was poorly carried out. In addition, there was no transitional programming to create a firm plan for post-release services.  Clearly there are lessons to be learned: most obviously it is important for program providers to remember that no matter how good the intentions are, there is a realistic possibility that programs can be harmful to offenders (see Criminological Highlights, V5N4#1, V6N2#4). As one researcher suggested, “Social programs deserve to be treated as serious attempts at intervention, with possibly toxic effects, so that a science of intervention can prosper” (p. 331)., Reference: Wilson, James A. and Robert C.

Youths who commit sexual offences are not very likely to commit sex offences as young adults.,", Special laws for sex offenders – e.g., registration, notification, special ‘peace bonds’ – are based in part on the assumption that once a person commits a sexual offence, that person will continue to commit such offences.  As these policies are extended to include youths who commit sex offences, it is important to consider whether there is any special reason to target juvenile sex offenders., Adult sex offenders are not especially likely to commit further sexual offences and do not look like the ‘specialist’ offenders they are sometimes believed to be (see, e.g., Criminological Highlights V3N3#3, V5N1#4, V6N3#3, V6N6#8, V8N3#3).  Nevertheless, they are often subject to special conditions after serving their sentences.  There seems to be an assumption that certain people are ‘born’ to be sex offenders and will not change., This study looks at the criminal careers of males who were born in 1942, 1949, and 1955 in Racine, Wisconsin. Their involvement in the criminal justice system was tracked until they were 32, 25, and 22 years old, respectively. The first part of the study looked at these cohorts when they were juveniles. Compared to youths whose list of offences did not include sex offences, boys who committed sex offences in Racine were much more likely to have large numbers of police ‘contacts’  (for various kinds of offences).   However, the vast majority of these contacts were not for sex offences.  Forty-three percent of the youths with a juvenile sex offence record had 9 or more contacts with the police and an additional 23% of juvenile sex offenders had 4-8 contacts with the police. However, more than three quarters of the youths with sex offence contacts only had one such contact.  Juvenile sex offenders, it seems, are high rate offenders who commit various offences. For the most part, however, they commit few sex offences (typically only one)., The second part of the study tracked these cohorts into adulthood. Only 8.5% of the boys who had a juvenile sex offence record had any contact with the police, as adults, for sex offences. This was not significantly higher than the adult sex offence rate (6.2%) for boys who had juvenile records that did not include sex offences.  Both of these rates were, however, higher than the rate of adult sex offences for those with no juvenile record (1.5%).   It appears that “juvenile sex offending does nothing to predict the type of adult record, specifically adult sex offending, above and beyond the frequency of [overall] offending…. Sex offenders are frequent offenders who roll the dice more often and increase their chances of accumulating a sex offence in their career” (p. 526-7, emphasis added).   When one looks at the backgrounds of males who have had contact with the police, as adults, for sex offences, it appears that only 4% of them had a juvenile sex offence.  What does appear to predict adult sex offending is simple: it is high rates of juvenile offending of any kind, whether that offending included a sex offence or not., Conclusion: The data demonstrate quite clearly that addressing adult sex offending by concentrating one’s efforts on juveniles who have committed sex offences is a foolish strategy: it will miss most adult sex offenders and will mis-identify most of the targeted group.   These findings are particularly relevant given that “most [U.S.] states currently require juvenile sex offenders to register…. These registries are inappropriate because those on the list may not be any more likely to commit another sexual offence as [adults than are those] who are not on these lists” (p. 530)., Reference:  Zimring, Franklin E., Alex R. Piquero, and Wesley G. Jennings (2007).

Ordinary citizens want sex offenders to be subject to civil commitment procedures largely in order to ensure that they are punished sufficiently.,", It is well established that recidivism rates for sex offenders do not differ substantially from the recidivism rates of other offenders (see Criminological Highlights 3(3)#3, 5(1)#4, 6(3)#3, 6(6)#8),  8(3)#8).  Nevertheless, there are many policies that appear to assume that special programs are needed to control sex offenders when they are released into the community (see Criminological Highlights 8(6)#5).  One such procedure is the civil commitment of offenders after they are released from prison because they are thought to be likely to commit another offence. Even though the identification of repeat sex offenders has been shown not to be reliable (see Criminological Highlights 8(6)#5),  such practices appear to be popular., This paper tries to understand the motives that underlie popular support for the civil commitment of those who have already served their sentences for a sex offence.  One possibility is that the public believes that such procedures are necessary for public safety.  A second possibility is that the public simply wants an opportunity to increase the punishment that these offenders receive., The assumption behind the study was that if members of the public were concerned about public safety, then professional estimates of the likelihood that a particular prisoner would re-offend would affect their judgements of whether that offender should be civilly committed. On the other hand, if those same members of the public supported civil commitment because they considered the sentences that these offenders received to be insufficient, the only thing that should matter in their decision making would be the severity of the sentence that the offender was serving., Two groups of people (jury eligible Americans with a median age of 47 and university students) were given vignettes describing a sex offender who was completing a sentence for two sex offences.  For approximately half of the participants, the sentence was described as harsh (25 years); for the others it was described as relatively lenient (3 years in a minimum security institution).  Different groups of participants were told that a careful assessment of the offender estimated his likelihood of re-offending as 0%, 4% or 70%.   Participants were then asked whether they supported or opposed civil commitment of the offender after the offender had served his complete sentence., Generally speaking, support for civil commitment was higher when the offender was described as having received a lenient sentence.  Support for civil commitment was affected by the professional estimate of the likelihood of re-offending, however, only when the original sentence was seen as sufficient. When the sentence he was completing was seen as lenient, the offender’s probability of recidivism had a much smaller impact.  Further support for the hypothesis that the desire for civil commitment was really a desire for a harsher sentence came also from another finding: substantially more people thought the offender should be civilly committed to a psychiatric hospital rather than a prison when he was seen as having been adequately punished., Conclusion:  The study provides evidence suggesting that public support for the civil commitment of sex offenders after they serve their sentences comes largely from the belief that they have not been punished enough.   The public safety goal of avoiding further offending through incapacitation appears to be relevant largely for those who are seen as already having been adequately punished., Reference: Carlsmith, Kevin M., John Monahan, and Alison Evans (2007).  The Function of Punishment in the “Civil” Commitment of Sexually Violent Predators.

Community notification about the whereabouts of sexual offenders released from prison has a negative impact on the very factors that appear to be important for their peaceful reintegration into society.,", The special procedures for sex offenders coming out of prison in many jurisdictions appear to be based on the false assumption that sex offenders are particularly likely to re-offend (see Criminological Highlights 3(3)#3, 5(1)#4, 6(3)#3, 6(6)#8), 8(3)#8).  Generally, there appear to be two related procedures imposed on this group when they are released from prison: legislative restrictions on such matters as where they can live,  and registries of ‘known sex offenders’ (see Criminological Highlights, 5(6)#17(4)#4, 8(6)#5) which may or may not include public notification procedures.  From what is known about sex offences, it is not surprising that these procedures seem to be of dubious value (see Criminological Highlights, 4(1)#2)., Procedures such as restrictions on the locations where offenders are allowed to live have been shown to create difficulties in the reintegration of ex-prisoners.  This paper looks at the impact of community notification procedures on the sex offenders themselves. 239 sex offenders living in Connecticut and Indiana were interviewed. In both states, names, addresses, descriptions and colour pictures as well as some information about their criminal records are available to anyone with internet access and are searchable by address., A number of offenders mentioned that they felt that there were some positive consequences of the notification laws.  For example, a sizable number (74%) of offenders indicated that being publicly identified made them more motivated to avoid re-offending so as to prove to others that they were not bad people.   Some (34%) believed that communities were safer when people know where sex offenders live.  About a third (31%) indicated that they thought that the notification procedures helped them manage risk factors (because they believed that neighbours were watching).  There is, however, no evidence that notification laws actually reduce re-offending rates., On the other hand, large numbers of offenders perceived there to be negative consequences that could interfere with peaceful reintegration into the community. More than half indicated that being identified as a sex offender had each of the following impacts: it increased stress; it kept them from participating in certain activities; it isolated them from others; and it gave them less hope for the future.  Almost half (46%) indicated that they feared for their safety, a feeling that was consistent with the fact that as a result of the notification laws 10% had been physically assaulted or injured, 21% had been threatened or harassed by neighbours, 18% experienced having their property damaged, and 16% reported that a person living with them had been harmed (as a result of their association with a known sex offender). One in five sex offenders (21%) reported that they had lost a job because a boss or co-workers found out about their past.  The results did not differ appreciably between the two states in which the research was carried out., Conclusion: Clearly there are negative consequences of efforts to publicize the identity of those who have been released from prison after serving time for sex offences.  Given the absence of convincing data on the efficacy of these procedures in reducing recidivism, it would appear that these broad notification policies “are more likely to undermine the stability of sex offenders than to provide the sweeping protection they intend to achieve” (p. 599)., Reference:  Levenson, Jill S., David A.

"The relationship between the racial composition of neighbourhoods in Seattle, Washington, and violent crime seems to be largely the result of two related factors: labour instability (unemployment, and high rates of undesirable jobs) and social disorder.",", It has been argued that jobs vary not only in terms of wages, but also in terms of work conditions, possibilities of advancement,  and, most importantly, in terms of job stability. In many cities, especially (perhaps) in the U.S., neighbourhoods that have high concentrations of Blacks also have high concentrations of those who have undesirable and intermittent employment., This paper examines the extent to which the link between the racial composition of a neighbourhood and violent crime can be explained by labour instability and social disorder. Labour instability was measured as a combination of the proportion of jobs that were low wage, low skill, with poor promotion prospects and the local unemployment rate.  Social disorder was estimated from reports by residents who were surveyed of troublesome neighbours and other local problems.  The focus of the paper was the violent crime rate (robbery, aggravated assault, rape, murder) in 123 census tracts in Seattle., It was hypothesized that race is associated with both labour instability and social disorder, and that labour instability and disorder combine to have an influence on violent crime in the community.  This was confirmed in part by demonstrating that the size of the effects of labour instability and income on crime were reduced when local social disorder was taken into account., In Seattle, as in many U.S. cities, violent crime rates are higher in neighbourhoods with high concentrations of people of colour.  It was expected that these high rates would be explained, at least in part, “by neighbourhood labour instability and low income because these factors create greater disorder, which in turn leads to crime” (p. 215)., However, the effects of these variables differed across minority groups.  Once labour instability was taken into account, the relationship between high concentration of Asians (and immigrants) and high rates of violent crime disappeared. “It appears that the employment disadvantage of neighbourhood residence completely accounts for higher violent crime rates where more Asians and immigrants live.  The relationships between the percentage of neighbourhood residents who are African American or Latinos and violent crime remain when we take into account the labour instability of those living in the community, but the effects of both are substantially reduced” (p. 215).   When average income and level of social disorder are taken into account, the association between violent crime and percent African American or Latino was reduced even further., Conclusion: “Neighbourhoods with large percentages of Asian Americans and immigrants have higher rates of violence because they have higher levels of labour instability and social disorder. In contrast, social disorder and labour instability explain part, but not all, of the effects of the percentage of African Americans and Latinos on neighbourhood violence.  Even after taking into account labour instability and social disorder, African American and Latino neighbourhoods still have higher rates of violence than other neighbourhoods” (p. 217).  In effect, these findings remind us that the roots of violence may differ, somewhat, from group to group., Reference: Crutchfield, Robert D., Ross L.

The police strategy of targeting minor disorder on the street – so-called ‘broken windows policing’ – does not reduce crime.,"In 1982, in an article in the Atlantic Monthly, James Q. Wilson and George Kelling suggested that if the police targeted minor instances of visible disorder – e.g., panhandling, prostitution – the rates of more serious crimes would drop.  Though 25 years later the evidence supporting their theory is at best mixed, there continues to be widespread belief that this strategy works., This study re-examined an earlier important study that purports to show beneficial effects of  ‘broken windows policing’ – a study of crime in New York by Kelling and Sousa. Although Kelling and Sousa were not willing to share their data with the current authors, equivalent data were compiled from original sources which allowed for more stringent assessment of the impact of this policing strategy on crime. The problem in assessing the impact of changes in policing strategies during the 1990s is that “Any study of the influences on American crime patterns during the past 20 years is complicated by the massive period effects that have generated dramatic year-to-year changes in crime across the country… Those cities that experienced the largest increases in crime during the [beginning of] this period [the 1980s] subsequently also experienced the largest drops [in the 1990s]” (p. 291)., This same problem is evident in New York City when one looks at individual neighbourhoods.  Crime dropped in New York City during the 1990s.  And, crime dropped most in those neighbourhoods in which broken-windows policing was most aggressively implemented.  It would appear, at first blush, that broken windows policing was a cause of the drop.  However, it is also true that broken windows policing was most aggressively implemented in neighbourhoods that had experienced the largest increases in violent crime during the 1980s.  The Kelling-Sousa study essentially related changes in violent crime to levels of misdemeanour arrests, ignoring the fact that the changes were, essentially, reversions to an earlier level of crime. Controlling for the size of the change (generally an increase) in violent crime during the period 1984-1989 eliminated the crime reducing impact of misdemeanour arrests during the period 1989-1998.  What goes up comes down, whether or not there is a police officer or city employee nearby fixing broken windows., The Kelling-Sousa study was not the only published study apparently showing support for the broken windows hypothesis.  Another study noted that there was a relationship, for the period 1970-2000 in New York as a whole, between the rate of misdemeanour arrests and violent crime, controlling for known correlates of crime.  The problem, once again, is that this ‘effect’ is driven largely by the decrease in crime that occurred in the late 1990s (the period when ‘broken windows policing’ was in vogue in New York).   The problem is that attributing a drop in crime that occurred largely in one time period to a single cause is risky.  The authors note that one could logically examine the ‘Broken Yankees Hypothesis’ (p. 298) by looking at the cumulative number of New York Yankee (baseball) championship wins as the possible cause, on the theory that New Yorkers are happy when their home team is winning and thus less likely to commit crime.  Plugging this variable into the equation, one finds that the ‘Broken Yankee Hypothesis’ fits the data just about as well as the ‘broken windows’ hypothesis., Conclusion. Though it can be shown that certain police activities – e.g., the targeting of ‘hot spots’ where crime is chronically prevalent – can reduce crime, the suggestion that broken windows policing will reduce violent crime is without empirical support and is most likely an artefact of the practice of focusing police resources (and, in particular, high rates of police charging of minor offenders) in those areas in which crime had been on the rise., Reference: Harcourt, Bernard E. and Jens Ludwig.  (2006) Broken Windows: New Evidence from New York City and a Five-City Social Experiment.

Changes in the structure of legal aid payments to lawyers affect the manner in which cases are processed.,", Many jurisdictions are concerned about the cost of providing legal services to criminal clients who are dependant on state sponsored legal aid systems. The key question is simple: is there a relationship between the manner in which legal aid payment regimes are structured and the manner in which cases are handled by lawyers?  It appears to be well-established that “the [legal] profession will not ever concede publicly that there may have been a decline in the effectiveness of defence work [as a result of the way in which legal aid payments are structured]” because to do so would be “to admit publicly… that financial arrangements play some part in how clients are advised and cases prepared” (p. 741)., In recent years, in a number of jurisdictions, including Scotland, standard or block fee arrangements have been seen as a way for governments to control legal aid costs. The Scottish legal aid system involves a fixed fee paid for everything that is done on a case through the first 30 minutes of an actual trial. After that, lawyers are paid a flat amount for each day of trial. A higher tariff is attached to a case that goes to the Sheriff Courts (the higher level court) than cases dealt with in the District Courts (courts generally presided over by lay justices). Although a case could be deemed to be ‘exceptional’ and, as a consequence, eligible for extra funding, almost no cases received this designation., From interviews and an examination of available records, it would appear that ‘specialist’ criminal law firms were initially hard hit by the change in the payment structure, but recovered within a couple of years by “sharply increasing the caseloads undertaken” (p. 727). In addition, levels of contact with clients decreased sharply.  Scottish defence lawyers, instead of receiving written documents disclosing the prosecution’s case, are given the names of prosecution witnesses and can arrange to have them interviewed and have statements taken.  These were previously “widely regarded by defence solicitors as vital to the preparation of a case for trial and conducting a trial” (p. 729).   Approximately 60% of the 60 solicitors interviewed thought that the use of this process of learning about the case against the accused had decreased as a result of the new fixed payment system.  Privately and anonymously, the lawyers would admit to the researchers that “The general level of preparation is less than it was before” (p. 729)., In the Scottish courts, a hearing is required before a trial is held to “review whether the parties are ready for trial… [and to attempt to] reduce the number of trials cancelled during, on, or shortly before the date of trial…” (p.733). This requirement increased the proportion of cases resolved before the day of trial.  When the change in the legal aid payment structure was introduced, the proportion of cases completed early in the process decreased slightly, as did the trial rate.  The number of cases resolved at this intermediate hearing or on the day of the trial increased somewhat.  As one solicitor noted “The most economic use of fixed fees is simply to plead everyone not guilty, apply for legal aid, get legal aid granted, then plead them all guilty in the intermediate [pretrial hearing]” (p. 735).   In general, the stage at which cases were concluded moved toward what the solicitor described as the most economically advantageous for the lawyer., Conclusion. It would appear that the legal aid tariff structures do, indeed, affect the manner in which cases are handled by defence counsel.  A number of those interviewed suggested that “the system of fixed payments seems to have led to a reduction in client contact and a decline in overall levels of preparation and case investigation…. Many… suggested that… the overall effectiveness of defence work had diminished” (p. 739)., Reference: Tata, Cyrus and Frank Stephen (2006).   “Swings and Roundabouts”: Do Changes to the Structure of legal Aid Remuneration Make a Real Difference to Criminal Case Management and Case Outcomes?  Criminal Law Review, 2006, 722-741., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV8N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-8-no-4-%E2%80%93-january-2007,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 8, No. 4 – January 2007",Regular Issue,2007
Deceptive sales practices in the life insurance business have become part of ‘normal business’:  sales agents are taught by companies how to be deceptive and not get caught.,", The easiest way for a large corporation to respond to allegations of fraud or dishonesty is to suggest that there are a few ‘bad apples’ in every organization, but that the company’s policies and practices are honest.  Life insurance companies, however, would have a hard time making this argument. A practice, referred to in some locations as ‘misselling’ of insurance policies – “violating industry rules, guidelines and codes of ethics, if not the law” – occurs quite regularly. These practices involve “institutionally endorsed manipulation, deception and sometimes fraud” (p. 994)., It is not surprising that fraud exists. What is interesting in this context is that companies appear routinely to engage in what might be called ‘moral risk’ – the ways in which an insurance relationship ‘fosters behaviour … that immorally increases risk to the others’ (p. 994).  That this is institutionalized can be demonstrated by the fact that companies appear not to modify these practices when their own employees bring it to their attention.  Part of the problem with life insurance and one reason that customers are vulnerable is that it is difficult to assess exactly what is being purchased in a life insurance policy: “Customers have difficulty knowing what it is that they are buying and often even knowing how much they are actually paying” (p. 998). An industry booklet “reinforced the culture of misconduct” by stressing that “Agents need to assume and work with the belief that everyone is under-insured” (p. 1006).  It was clear that life insurance agents who were interviewed as part of this study understood the nature of their deceptive practices with customers.  A number of them indicated that they had changed jobs within the company “after discovering the market misconduct that was expected of them” (p. 1004).  Indeed under the so-called “career agent” system, it appears that “most agents [leave] the business once they have exhausted their own family, friends and extended social networks” (p. 1005) as potential customers., Life insurance sales earnings are based almost exclusively on commissions, “creating a strong incentive to market aggressively and to sell the highest commission product rather than the right product for the consumer’s needs” (p. 997).  Large commissions to the seller lead, among other things, to a practice known as ‘churning’ – persuading customers to change their coverage even if the costs of doing so makes the change economically unwise for them.  Replacement policies sometimes result in higher commissions than new client policies.  Indeed, one insurance executive interviewed for the study freely admitted that instead of using agents on commission, the company would assign salaried employees to talk to certain customers in circumstances in which it was important to the insurance company to be completely trustworthy to a favoured client. On the other hand, “because promotion in the company ranks seemed to be based solely on productivity, agents who engaged in rule-breaking were likely to be promoted” (p. 1006)., Conclusion.  It is clear that deceptive practices in the life insurance business are the result of organizational strategies, not individual deviance.  Agents are, in effect, taught how to be deceptive with customers.  Nevertheless, when faced with a scandal resulting from systematic market misconduct, companies attempt to view the agents as being responsible. Ironically, an employment practices insurer told the researchers that life insurance companies are seen as being among the worst risks regarding employment practices, because ‘life insurance companies faced potential liability suits from agents on the argument that the agents were structurally induced to participate in market misconduct” (p. 1009).  It appears that on occasion within the insurance community, the “marketing practices of life insurers were themselves too flawed by moral risks to be insurable” (p. 1009)., Reference: Ericson, Richard V. and Aaron Doyle (2006).  The Institutionalization of Deceptive Sales in Life Insurance.  British Journal of Criminology, 46, 993-1010., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV8N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-8-no-4-%E2%80%93-january-2007,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 8, No. 4 – January 2007",Regular Issue,2007
Offenders who have gone six or seven years without committing a new offence are only slightly more likely to offend than are people who have no criminal record at all.,", It is common for employers to ask job applicants whether they have a criminal record. Though in some places, such as Canada, most offenders can apply for a pardon if they have lived ‘crime free’ for a certain period of time (3-5 years after the end of the sentence in Canada, depending on the offence), being pardoned does not mean that one does not, for certain purposes, have a criminal record.  For example, although in Canada a criminal record cannot be used to deny a pardoned individual a job that is regulated by federal law, other employers can still refuse to hire someone who has a criminal record but has been pardoned.  These decisions would appear to be informed by the notion that “once a criminal, always a criminal.” But are ex-offenders who live crime-free for extended periods of time, in fact, any more likely to offend than people who have no criminal record?, Two very similar studies (by the same three authors and published nearly simultaneously in different journals) use different data sets to examine the re-offending records of groups of male offenders.  In the first study, the records of reoffending (to age 26) for all 13,160 males who were born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1958 were examined.  In the second study the records of males born in Racine, Wisconsin in 1942 were examined up to their 32nd birthday. In each of these studies, the likelihood of subsequent offending could be compared for two different groups: those who, by a certain age, had offended and those who apparently had not offended by the time they reached this same age. In one study an arrest for a criminal charge was used as a proxy for re-offending; in the other the measure was a ‘contact’ with the police in relation to a criminal matter., The findings from the two studies are quite consistent. Early in their adult lives (e.g., when they were age 20), the likelihood of offending for those who had offended at least once by age 18 was about four times as high as the likelihood for those who had been crime free at age 18 (8% vs. <2%).  However, those people who had offended before they turned 18, but had been crime free up until age 25, had only a 2% likelihood of offending at age 25. This was, however, slightly higher than the likelihood of offending for those who had been crime free at age 18 (<0.5%).  In the second study, the data show that those who had been juvenile offenders were more likely to offend as young adults, but “in any given year after the mid-20s, there appears to be little difference in offending likelihoods between juvenile offenders who have avoided offending during early adulthood and those with no record at all” (p. 72).   A similar analysis was carried out comparing those who, by age 20, had not offended to those who had at least one police contact between the ages of 18 and 20.  In their early 20s, these two groups differed dramatically: those who had offended as young adults (age 18-20) were more likely to offend in their early 20s.  However, if a youth made it to about age 25 without re-offending, the likelihood of reoffending was no different than for those who had never offended., Conclusion.  This analysis suggests that those who are using criminal history information “should place [this information] into a context that pays close attention to the recency of the criminal record as well as the [mere] existence of a criminal record.  That is, if a person with a criminal record remains crime free for a period of about 7 years, his or her risk of a new offence is similar to that of a person without any criminal record” (p. 80). It would appear that there is empirical justification for legal procedures like the pardon that recognize that former offenders who have not reoffended after a period of time do not, in fact, present special risks to society., References: Kurlychek, Megan C., Robert Brame, and Shawn D.

"Oregon’s “get tough on crime” law, passed by voters in 1994, had an impact on the courts: trial rates increased for the first two years after the law came into effect. More people went to prison, and they went to prison for longer periods of time.",", On 1 April 1995, a sentencing referendum (Measure 11) brought in by the voters in Oregon resulted in long mandatory minimum sentences for 16 violent and sex related crimes. In addition it prohibited ‘early’ release from prison, and it provided automatic transfer of youths to adult court for these same offences. Five more offences were added to the list shortly thereafter.  The theory behind the bill was simple: residents of Oregon were to be safer because offenders would be incapacitated or deterred.  However, research on these topics [see, e.g.,  Criminological Highlights 3(1)#1, 6(2)#1,  7(3)#6, 8(1)#2, 8(3)#6] demonstrates that crime is essentially unaffected by legal changes such as those contained in the referendum., Previous research has found that there is often “hydraulic displacement of discretion” – meaning that a change in the processing of cases has consequential effects in another part of the system – in circumstances such as that which followed the change in the Oregon law.  In the case of mandatory minimum sentences, the typical finding is that “prosecutorial authority to determine which offenders are prosecuted [under the new provisions] is enhanced, whereas judges lose much of their authority over the sentencing process” (p. 11).  In addition, it is often found that sentence lengths for ‘non-targeted’ offences increase along side of the ‘targeted’ offences., In the case of Oregon, it was found that there was a decrease in the prosecution of Measure-11-eligible cases and an increase in the prosecution of ‘alternate’ cases (typically lesser degrees of the same offences which did not attract the mandatory penalty).  Trial rates for Measure-11-eligible offences also increased in the first two years after implementation, and then reverted to their former levels.  But the nature of pleas changed: there was an increase in the number of cases in which the accused decided to plead to lesser included offences, and a decrease in pleas involving the original charge.  The rate of prison sentences, however, increased both for Measure-11 eligible cases and for Measure-11 alternate cases.   The group contributing most to the increased use of prison sentences for Measure-11 cases were cases in which the offender had no history of offending. The average prison sentence increased from 77 to 105 months.  However, this “success” has to be understood in the context of another effect: sentence lengths for some of the Measure 11-alternate cases  decreased.  Overall, though, imprisonment rates in Oregon increased during this period., What seemed to be happening was that after the new law came into effect, rather than being charged with a Measure-11-eligible offence, an offender may be charged with a lesser offence, yet receive approximately the same sentence that the Measure-11-eligible offence would have drawn before Measure 11 came into effect. In other words, “fewer offenders have been sentenced for the [Measure-11] offences, whereas a greater proportion of offenders have been sentenced for Measure-11-alternate offences. [The] analysis suggests that this shift resulted from the use of prosecutorial discretion and the downgrading of cases, that, although technically Measure-11-eligible, were not deemed appropriate for the associated mandatory minimum penalty” (p. 31). Said differently, prosecutors were sometimes willing to downgrade the offence when the mandatory minimum punishment did not fit the crime., Conclusion: It is clear that “prosecutorial discretion is the force that drives the implementation and… the impact of mandatory minimum sentencing policy” (p.33).  There was, in addition and not surprisingly, evidence of variation in the manner in which the new policies were implemented across locations.  Clearly, the implementation of mandatory minimum sentences is not as straightforward as it would appear to be in the legislation., Reference: Merritt, Nancy, Terry Fain, and Susan Turner (2006).

"The Level of Supervision Inventory-Revised (LSI-R), which is widely used to identify offenders who are likely to reoffend, “misclassifies a significant portion of socially and economically marginalized women” (p. 384) whose pathways into crime do not follow typical male patterns.",", The Level of Supervision Inventory-Revised (LSI-R) is described by its advocates as being equally effective in classifying women as it is for men.  The LSI-R consists of 54 items said to assess two kinds of risks and needs that relate to continued criminal activity: “static” risks (life experiences, such as prior convictions, that cannot change) and “dynamic” risks (factors such as peer interactions that change over time). The theory behind the LSI-R appears to be that “offending stems from an assortment of incentives and disincentives regarding criminal and conventional behaviour that arise from various sources, especially family members and peers” (p. 386).  These underlying causal mechanisms “are said to explain offending behaviour for all individuals regardless of their gender, race and ethnicity or their pathway to crime” (p. 386).  In other words, it is assumed, among other things,  that the “causal mechanisms” for men and women are the same. It is important to note, however, that LSI-R scores predict only a small portion of the variance in recidivism (about 12.5%, an estimate based largely on studies with males)., There are empirical reasons to suggest that there may be important limitations in the usefulness of the LSI-R in predicting women’s recidivism. In particular, criminologist Kathleen Daly has suggested that women’s ‘pathways’ to crime may be different from those of men. In particular, she has shown that there are “conditions and circumstances [for women] that spawn violence and illegal forms of economic gain” (p. 390). These differ from the pathways associated with male criminality.  Pathways to crime that are much more likely to involve women include committing criminal acts (e.g., prostitution, drug dealing) to survive on the street, being involved in drug offences along with an intimate partner, suffering sexual abuse and neglect as children, and being in abusive relationships with intimate partners. Finally, one group could be considered to have male-like pathways to crime: women whose crimes relate largely to economic issues (e.g., as a result of being economically marginalized or because of simple acquisitive motivations)., As part of this study, women convicted of felonies were interviewed in Minnesota and Oregon prior to beginning community supervision and again approximately one year later. LSI-R measures were obtained during the first interview. Information was also obtained about how the woman ended up being involved in the crime that resulted in the community supervision. Two researchers reviewed the biographical information about each woman and classified her as either following a ‘gendered pathway’ to crime or as following an ‘economic’ pathway to crime. A small number of women could not be classified (e.g., because they had committed very minor crimes or their crimes were seen as being isolated incidents in their lives).  A woman was classified as a recidivist if there was official information that she had violated a supervision condition, or had been rearrested, reconvicted, or had her supervision revoked., Overall, there were no significant differences in the recidivism rates of ‘high’, ‘moderate’, and ‘low’ risk women as measured by the LSI-R.  Most interesting was the finding that for the women who got involved in crime for economic reasons (the typical male pathway), the LSI-R did have a small relationship with recidivism: it predicted approximately 9% of the variance in recidivism for this subset of women.  But for the women whose pathways to crime were ‘gendered’ (street women, drug-connected, battered, harmed and harming), there was no relationship whatsoever between the LSI-R and reoffending. Said differently, for a large group of women, the LSI-R was useless in predicting their likelihood of recidivism., Conclusion.  The LSI-R predicts only a small portion of the variance in recidivism for men and is even less useful for women. Since the reasons women end up committing crimes are often different from those of men, it makes sense that this instrument is, for many identifiable groups of women, essentially useless as a classification tool.  It turns out that an LSI-R score is a predictor of future offending only for those women who are identified as having been involved in crime for reasons that resemble those of men., Reference: Reisig, Michael D., Kristy Holtfreter and Merry Morash (2006).

Laws that require that youths charged with serious offences be tried in adult court do not reduce violent juvenile crime rates.,", By 2003, 22 U.S. states had provisions whereby youths charged with serious offences were automatically tried in adult court.  Most of the research on transfer provisions in youth court has focused on the impact of being transferred and has generally found that youths, if anything, are more likely to re-offend if they are treated as if they were adults than if they were allowed to remain in youth court (see, e.g., Criminological Highlights, 3(5)#5, 5(5)#3, 2(4)#3, 1(3)#2).  However, these transfer provisions are usually justified on the basis of general deterrence: the theory is that youths will decide not to offend if they assume that they will receive harsher penalties from an adult court.  This paper examines this hypothesis., By analyzing violent crime rates in those 21 states for which there existed 5 years of data prior to and 5 years of data after the effective date of the new law, the possible impact on crime in each state of the statutory exclusion law could be assessed. For 17 of the states, there was no significant change in the juvenile violent crime rate (as measured by juvenile arrest rates).  For two there were increases and for another two there were decreases. For only one of these states (Maine) was the change as predicted: an abrupt permanent decrease after the change in the law. For these four states, control states were identified that did not have legislative waivers at around the same time as the intervention states and that resembled the intervention state on other dimensions (e.g.,  size, location, juvenile arrest rate). In no cases did these control states show effects similar to the intervention state suggesting that the changes in crime rates were real. However,  the inconsistent direction of these changes in juvenile crime rates suggest that the law change may have been completely irrelevant to the change in crime rates even in these four states.  When arrest rates for homicide were examined, there were no significant effects coinciding with the changes in law., Though there are no clear explanations for why there might have been a significant drop in crime that coincided with the implementation of legislative transfers of violent juvenile offenders to adult court in two states (Maine and Wisconsin), these findings need to be considered along side the increases in crime that took place in two other states (Indiana and Missouri).  Once again, as in the case of the deterrent impact of harsh adult sentencing laws (see Criminological Highlights 7(3)#6) isolated instances in selected jurisdictions of ‘success’ in lowering crime through harsh practices need to be evaluated in a larger context.  In these instances, there are as many significant negative impacts of the transfer provisions as there are positive impacts., Conclusion.  “Legislative waiver of juveniles to adult criminal court does not have a deterrent effect on violent juvenile crime.  Indeed this has been the case with other get-tough legislation…. [T]his may not sit well with policy makers who suggest toughening the juvenile justice system’s response to serious and violent juvenile crime as the panacea to reducing its occurrence….” (p. 50).  These data need to be interpreted in conjunction with other data suggesting that there are no positive effects for those youths who are transferred to adult court., Reference: Steiner, Benjamin, Craig Hemmens, and Valerie Bell (2006).  Legislative Waiver Reconsidered: General Deterrent Effects of Statutory Exclusion Laws Enacted Post-1979.

"A nationally representative sample of U.S. residents report overwhelming support for increased spending on preventing youth crime, for drug treatment for non-violent offenders, and for the police, but they show little support for spending money on building more prisons.",", A serious problem with many public opinion polls concerning public policy is that members of the public are typically not forced to make tradeoffs among programs that they favour.  For example, a question like “Should more money be spent on the police to reduce crime?” doesn’t offer the respondent any choices of other strategies that they might prefer. It is easy to be in favour of something if nothing has to be given up.  If one wants to know what the public would do if faced with real fiscal choices, one needs to ask how they would allocate a fixed budget to various priorities. In an earlier study it was found, for example, that Canadians would generally prefer to invest in the prevention of crime or in non-prison sanctions rather than pay for more prisons (Criminological Highlights, 4(1)#5)., In this study, 1300 interviews were carried out during the summer of 2000 with a representative sample of  U.S. adults. Respondents were asked to put themselves in the shoes of their local mayor and imagine that the Federal Government had just given their municipality a sum of money which could be allocated to crime control or crime prevention, or it could be given back to local residents in the form of a tax rebate.  Five strategies were listed for each respondent and respondents were asked to allocate the money across these strategies. Across the sample, 37% of the money was allocated to prevention programs to keep youths out of trouble, 22% to drug treatment for offenders convicted of non-violent crimes, 21% for more police on the street, and 8% was allocated for more prisons. Residents allocated 12% for a cash rebate to local residents., Black Americans were more likely than white and Latino Americans to want to allocate funds for programs to keep youths out of trouble, and were less likely than members of these groups to want to allocate funds for prisons. Those who indicated that they worried a lot about crime indicated that they would spend more of the money on prisons and on drug treatment for non-violent offenders and on the police, and less money on prevention programs to keep youths out of trouble. “It appears that those who currently worry about crime are more concerned about immediate responses to crime at the expense of long-term youth crime prevention” (p. 327).  On the other hand, those who had reported having been victims of crime “tended to give less money to prisons and police and more to prevention (though these [effects] are significant only for certain groups of victims)” (p. 330).  Income had very little impact on the allocation of funds: “the lowest income levels… had remarkably similar responses to these questions as those with the highest income” (p. 330)., Conclusion.  These findings are consistent with other studies carried out with less nationally representative samples which showed that “despite the overall punitiveness of the public toward criminals, there is also significant support for both rehabilitation of offenders and early intervention programs designed to prevent high risk youth from later engaging in criminal activity” (p. 333).   Though the public would spend considerably more of any allocation of funds on the police than they would on the building of more prisons, even the police would not receive as high a proportion of any special ‘crime prevention’ funds as would prevention programs., Reference: Cohen, Mark A., Roland T.

The shine is beginning to fade on harsh sentencing policies in some states in the U.S.,"In the past 30 years, the rate of imprisonment in many U.S. states has increased at least four-fold.  These changes appear to relate in part to certain policing policies (e.g., the war on drugs), but also to sentencing policies in the various states.  Although until recently many states appeared to have an uncontrollable taste for high imprisonment policies, it would appear that this is beginning to change.  It is suggested that the combination of the (now) long-term drop in crime (especially violent crime) that has taken place over the past 10-15 years and budget crises at the state level have allowed states to begin to move toward more moderate policies.  Even though there are some hints that policies are beginning to moderate, the impact of previously enacted sentencing regimes such as three-strikes sentencing will continue for some time to have an impact on the size of the American prison population., In the three years ending in 2006, at least 22 states brought in more moderate criminal justice policies.   These might be seen as falling into four main categories:, Conclusion. The steps that have been taken in recent years recognize, implicitly, the failure of previous high imprisonment policies to serve the best interests of the community.  Though these modest changes are likely to make some difference, other policies – such as the large number of mandatory minimum penalties that still exist – will continue to have an impact on correctional populations., Reference: King, Ryan S.

Adolescents who are old enough to be held criminally responsible are not likely to understand courtroom terminology.,", Lawyers who deal with young people often use age-appropriate terminology when speaking with very young children.  However, they tend to believe that when a child enters adolescence there is no longer a need for adults to use special language when trying to communicate with them. If older children (i.e., those age 12 or older) do not adequately understand legal terminology, the problem may not be noticed since “younger children are more likely to admit their lack of knowledge than older children who will often try to give an answer even when they are unsure” (p. 654)., This study tested youths in two Irish schools: one for youths who largely came from poorer single-parent homes and lived in relatively high crime areas; the other school had youths who were predominately from middle class families.  Youths (age 12, 13 or 15) were asked to indicate whether they recognized a legal term, and then were asked for a description of what the term meant.  Each description was then coded according to how complete and adequate it was. The difference in the understanding of the terms between schools was not significant.  There were, however, large age differences both in terms of ‘recognizing’ the legal term and in providing a description of what it meant. For example:, One can only imagine what a young witness for the prosecution might think if she were told that as a result of her allegation against the defendant, she would have to testify and then be cross examined by the prosecution. All four of the italicized terms were not well understood by youths of all ages., Conclusion. The results of this study show that young people have a very poor understanding of everyday legal terminology that many lawyers apparently assume is well understood.  It would appear, therefore, that not only accused youths, but witnesses more generally, may suffer as a result of their inadequate understanding of what is happening around them., Reference:  Crawford, Emma and Ray Bull (2006).

Living in an economically disadvantaged community amplifies the effects that family factors have on crime.,", It has long been recognized that the family plays an important role in determining a child’s involvement in crime.  Similarly, it has been established that neighbourhood characteristics – above and beyond the characteristics of those living in these neighbourhoods – have effects on crime rates (See Criminological Highlights 1(2)#2).  What is not as well understood is whether the impact of neighbourhood characteristics is similar for all types of families., This study tests “the hypothesis that community disadvantage amplifies the effects of key family variables on crime” suggesting that “these effects [of the family]… become stronger as community disadvantage increases” (p. 328).   This hypothesis is consistent with the idea that “exposure to multiple causes of crime produces an increase in crime that exceeds the sum of those causes’ independent effects” (p. 328).  The study examines five family risk factors: weak attachment, weak supervision, weak prosocial reinforcement, physical punishment, and coercive discipline. Community disadvantage was assessed by four measures related to poverty (average family income, unemployment rate, average education of household members, and percent of households receiving social assistance). In addition, parents rated their own communities on whether they saw their neighbourhoods as a good place to raise children, providing a more subjective measure of the nature of the neighbourhood., The results show that, above and beyond individual controls (gender of the youth, race, parental education, parental income, unmarried mother), children from higher risk families (those exhibiting what might be considered to be less than optimal parenting styles) were more likely to be involved in crime (as measured by the youth’s self-reports of involvement in person, property, or drug crime, and self-reported contact with the police)., More importantly, “the effects of family problems [were] greater at high values of community poverty and perceived community weakness” (p. 343).  The effects were strongest when looking at the family environment as a whole, rather than as individual parts, indicating that it is the accumulation of family problems, combined with the nature of the community, that is most important., Conclusion. Children who grow up in problematic families – families with parenting styles conducive to the development of offending – appear to be especially likely to engage in crime when the community in which they live is also disadvantaged (i.e., it is poor and has high unemployment, or is seen simply as not a good place to raise children).  Said differently, “a given cause [of crime] may be more likely to increase crime when it occurs in the presence of other causes” (p. 348).  From a policy perspective, this would suggest that efforts to improve communities – changes which turn these communities  into places where parents would want to bring up their children or policies that address the disadvantaged nature of certain communities – will have a disproportionately positive impact on exactly those children most likely to engage in crime – those from families whose child rearing approaches are less than optimal., Reference: Hay, Carter, Edward N.

Being arrested and taken to court reduces a youth’s chances of finishing high school.,", It is well known that youths who are heavily involved in crime are less likely to complete secondary school than are youths less involved in crime.  In addition, of course, dropping out of school is an indicator of other difficulties such as poor school performance or misbehaviour in school.   From a policy perspective, however, one question that needs to be asked is whether involvement in the youth justice system– above and beyond involvement in crime – is likely to have an effect on a youth’s likelihood of finishing school.  Said differently, if two youths have similar offending and school backgrounds, and one happens to be apprehended for offending and taken to court, do the two youths have different likelihoods of successfully finishing high school?, By using data from an American longitudinal study, this study was able to estimate the causal relationship among these variables by following high school youths who, at age 16, had not been involved in the youth justice system.  The youths’ involvement in crime as well as the youths’ records in school were assessed at that point and hence could be used as controls for what happened after age 16.   When the youths were interviewed two years later, some had been arrested and taken to court, and by the time that the youths were 19 years old, some had dropped out of school.  Because level of involvement in crime as well as school performance and misbehaviour in school (suspensions) could be controlled, it was possible to assess whether being arrested and being taken to court (independent of involvement in crime and performance in school) had an effect on the dropout rate., Not surprisingly, youths who dropped out of high school were more likely to report various types of offending than did youths who completed school.  Similarly, dropouts were more likely to report doing poorly in school, to have experienced poverty, and to have had various difficulties in school.  However, above and beyond these effects, being arrested by the police for an offence slightly decreased a youth’s chances of graduating from high school.  More importantly – independent of level of offending – being taken to court for the offence had an even greater impact on creating a high school dropout.  Indeed, an analysis that contained only those youths for whom precise data could be inferred regarding when they dropped out suggests “that youths who are arrested, but who do not appear in court, actually experience no detrimental effects on their odds of high school graduation relative to non-arrested youths” (p. 474).   Other analyses suggest that “the effect of court involvement is more pronounced for those with less prior involvement in delinquency” (p. 474)., Conclusion. The data are most consistent with the finding that  “First-time court appearance during high school is more detrimental for education outcomes than first-time arrest without a court appearance.”  This result is “consistent with one version of labelling theory [that] suggests that official sanctions stigmatize youths, inducing a deviant self-concept” (p. 477).  But it is also consistent with another labelling explanation that would suggest that the effect may be due to limitations on a youth’s opportunities as a result of court involvement.  Finally, of course, court involvement could put a youth in contact with other offending youths.  This study obviously focuses on the impact of arrest and court involvement on the likelihood of completing high school and not on future offending.  Nevertheless, to the extent that a society values secondary school completion, it would seem that policies that limit the use of court for offending youths can be justified, in part, because they are likely to lead to higher secondary school completion rates., Reference: Sweeten, Gary (2006).  Who Will Graduate?

Citizens’ level of satisfaction with the police depends primarily on how the police treat them.,", There are a number of reasons for caring how the police are perceived by the community. One reason is obvious: “Positive views of the police make the work of the police easier and more effective” (p. 317).  In addition, “The degree to which people view the police as legitimate influences whether they comply with police orders or requests.  More generally, people accept the decisions of police when they believe the police have acted fairly and openly with them” (p. 317)., This study, then, examines what, in an encounter between a citizen and the police, determines how the police are perceived by citizens. The conclusions are drawn from a survey carried out in 2001 of 2513 citizens of Chicago, Illinois.  Respondents were asked about their contacts with the police in the previous 12 months (e.g., who initiated contact and for what purpose or in what situation) and they were asked to assess the quality of that interaction.  The likelihood of being stopped by the police (in a car or on foot) was related to gender (being male), age (being young), and race (being Latino, or more dramatically, being black). Not surprisingly, those whose encounters with the police were citizen initiated  were more favourable toward the police than were those who experienced police-initiated encounters. Generally speaking, there was very little variation across racial groups, age, or gender in satisfaction with citizen-initiated encounters. In other words, for citizen initiated encounters, race, gender, and age had little effect on the ratings of the police on dimensions such as whether the police responded quickly or on time, whether the police listened to the citizen, whether the police explained their actions adequately, and whether the police were polite and helpful.  For police-initiated encounters, however, African-Americans and non-English speaking Latinos were less likely to be satisfied with the encounter than were whites in terms of dimensions such as whether the police were fair and polite., For citizen-initiated encounters, overall satisfaction with the police was related to whether the citizen thought that the police had behaved well (e.g., had been helpful, polite, thorough in their explanations, etc.) and not to age or race.  For police-initiated contact, there was a ‘race’ effect, but it was considerably smaller in magnitude than were the effects of the quality of the encounter itself (whether the police officers explained their actions, or whether they were perceived as fair and polite).   The data would suggest, then, that the impact of race on ratings of the police is largely due to differential ratings of the quality of the police-initiated contact., Conclusion. The findings suggest that the quality of police-citizen contacts can have important effects on how the police are seen by ordinary citizens.  Giving citizens an opportunity  to explain their situation and communicate their views,  fair and polite treatment by the police, each have a direct impact – on all demographic groups – on how the police are perceived. “Unlike many of the outcomes of policing, including safer streets and healthier communities, these are factors that recruitment, training, and supervision by police departments can assuredly affect…  Process based reactions benefit the police, because they cannot always provide desirable outcomes, but it is almost always possible to behave in ways that people experience as being fair” (p. 318)., Reference:  Skogan, Wesley (2005).  Citizen Satisfaction with Police Encounters.  Police Quarterly, 8 (3), 298-321., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV8N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-8-no-5-%E2%80%93-april-2007,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 8, No. 5 – April 2007",Regular Issue,2007
Can pretrial detention populations be reduced by changing the rules for the police?,", Policy makers in a number of jurisdictions have expressed concern about rates of pretrial detention.  In Canada, for example, although overall imprisonment rates have been steady for the past 45 years (see Criminological Highlights, 8(2)#6), pretrial detention rates have been increasing for at least the past decade. Controlling prison populations of any type is difficult.  The argument with pretrial detention, however, is that statutory changes are not necessarily required since whether a person is held in pretrial detention is largely a function of arrest policies and bail standards which are likely to be under local control., The county in the U.S.  in which the current study was carried out had been under (Federal) court order to control its jail population.  In order to do this, the county court executive committee decided to require that, for certain non-violent offences, police issue a summons rather than arrest the suspect. The “policy” then was that there should be no arrests.  Furthermore, the county court executive committee ordered the county sheriff’s department to cease accepting those accused brought to the lockup facility who were charged (only) with one of these offences.  This study examines the manner in which this policy was implemented and, to some extent, its effects on the operation of the justice system., The first, rather predictable, finding was that compliance with the new policy – even though it came from the court – was not complete.  Prior to the policy 60% of accused were arrested and taken to the county jail. During the period when the policy was in place, pretrial detention on these cases dropped dramatically, but 20% of the cases that fell within the “no arrest” policy still resulted in an arrest and detention. Prior to the implementation of the policy, 63% of those who had been issued summons rather than being arrested showed up as required without the need for an arrest warrant. After the implementation of the policy, with a considerably higher proportion (and number) of accused being issued summons, the figure was about the same (61%).  However, because the numbers of those issued summons under the new policy was so much higher, this translated into a larger number of the accused people not showing up to court as required.  Said differently, 31.5% of those who came into contact with the police for one of these offences after the policy period had warrants issued for their arrest compared to only 15.1% prior to the new policy., The net effect of the policy was that there were fewer people brought to the jail, but some of them arrived there as a result of warrants being issued.  Hence, the initial apparent decrease in the use of pretrial detention was moderated, to some extent, by the fact that accused people were brought into custody as a result of a charge of failure to appear in court.  The final dispositions of these (minor) cases did not, in the end, change very much: in about half of the cases, all charges were dismissed., Conclusion. Compliance with court-ordered reduction in pretrial detention was implemented relatively – but not completely – successfully. Part of the reason for the success, however, may have been that there were explicit rules from a legitimate authority (the county court) that could be enforced (in this case by the jail officials who could refuse to accept a prisoner who should not have been arrested). Because a larger number of people were issued a summons rather than being brought to jail to await trial, more people did not appear, as required, in court. However, even though many more people were released who, prior to the implementation of the policy, would not have been released, the proportion who did not appear in court as required did not increase appreciably. In the end, about half of these cases were dismissed suggesting, perhaps, either that they were not very serious to begin with or that the police did not have the evidence on which to convict the accused., Reference: Baumer, Terry L. and Kenneth Adams.

"When members of the public think about crime policies, their level of support for repressive measures tells you nothing about whether they support rehabilitation.",", In jurisdictions in which judges decide which purposes of sentencing to emphasize, they are often encouraged to conceptualize their sentences as primarily focusing on harshness for deterrence purposes (repression) or on rehabilitative principles (measures that might improve an offender’s life, foster ties with the community, or provide treatment to the offender). Hence it is not surprising that these two constructs are often seen as being polar opposites, where the presence of one implies the absence of the other., Empirically, however, there is little evidence of a negative relationship between support for repression and support for rehabilitation. This study, using a nationally representative sample of 1,892 Dutch residents surveyed in early 2005, tests the relationship between support for rehabilitation and repression., Support for ‘repression’ was measured with 6 questions such as “If judges would impose higher penalties, we would have fewer criminals” and “Minors committing serious crimes should be punished as if they were adults” (p. 827).  Support for rehabilitation was measured with 12 questions such as “Offering good educational opportunities prevents people from wrongdoing,”  “The judiciary should make efforts to prevent ex-convicts from feeling excluded from the community,” and “Developing consciousness of norms is a very important form of crime prevention” (p. 828)., Not surprisingly, support for ‘repressive’ approaches was considerably stronger among supporters of right-wing political parties and those endorsing authoritarian values than among supporters of left-of-centre parties and those rejecting authoritarian values.  However, there were essentially no differences in the support for rehabilitative approaches among supporters of the various political parties or among those who varied on authoritarian values.  Furthermore, support for repressive approaches and support for rehabilitative approaches were uncorrelated. People who saw crime as being caused by factors internal to the individual (e.g., those who endorsed such items as “Once a thief, always a thief”) tended to support repressive approaches.  Those who saw crime as externally caused (endorsing such items as “Criminals often come from broken homes”) were more likely to endorse rehabilitative approaches., Conclusion. “Many criminologists and policy makers conceive of public support for repression and rehabilitation as two diametrically opposed options” (p. 832).  This analysis suggests that such a view is without empirical foundation and that “rehabilitation is equally popular among the constituencies of conservative political parties as among those of progressive ones” (p. 832). It would appear, then, that support for rehabilitative approaches to crime or approaches that improve offenders’ life chances is more evenly distributed across the population than previously thought.  From the perspective of ordinary people, then, support for repressive approaches does not automatically mean a rejection of rehabilitation., Reference: Mascini, Peter and Dick Houtman.

New York City’s attempt to snuff out violent crime by arresting those found to be smoking marijuana in public places failed.,", Criminal justice officials and legislatures in many countries constantly search for easy ways to reduce crime. The appearance that something is being done to prevent or reduce crime seems to be at least as important when crime rates are decreasing (as they did in the 1990s in the U.S.) as when crime is increasing or staying the same.   Between 1994 and 2000, the New York City police increased their arrest rate for the misdemeanour charge of smoking marijuana in public view (MPV) from fewer than 2,000 arrests to over 50,000 arrests per year. In 2000, arrests for MPV accounted for 15% of all felony and misdemeanour arrests in the city.  Aside from any other concerns that one might have, these arrests disproportionately targeted African-Americans and Hispanics.  Compared to whites, members of these two groups in New York City were, according to a previous study, more likely to be arrested, detained in custody awaiting trial, convicted, and sentenced to jail. Presumably the justification for the crackdown on MPV is simple and is based on the “broken windows” theory of crime control. By cracking down on minor crimes – in this case MPV –  other more serious crimes would, it was asserted,  miraculously disappear., The miracle did not happen. This paper, using data collected by the authors of a previous study, examined the impact of MPV arrests on crime in the city’s police precincts.  The statistical techniques used were similar to those used in an earlier study (see Criminological Highlights, 8(4)#1).   The most simple analysis (looking at the relationship between arrests for MPV and violent crime) would appear to support the ‘broken windows’ hypothesis:  violent crime was lower in locations in which MPV arrests were highest during the 1990s, controlling for the overall rate of crime in the precinct for the decade and for overall trends during the decade.  When the authors added various controls (e.g., police strength in the precinct, unemployment, proportion of population that was between age 19 and 24, race), there was still an effect., The problem is that such an analysis does not take into account a simple fact: crackdowns on crime in different parts of the city are likely to relate to pre-existing levels of crime.  The locations that show the biggest drop in crime might reasonably be expected to be those that showed the largest increases in an earlier period.  Indeed, the police precincts with the highest violent crime rates in 1989 experienced the largest MPV arrests in the 1990s and the largest declines in violent crime between 1989 and 2000.  More importantly, the precincts with the largest violent crime decline in the 1990s were those that had the largest increase in crime between 1984 and 1989 and, coincidentally, the largest ‘crack down’ on MPV in the 1990s. When the violent crime rate in 1989 (before the marijuana crackdown) or change in violent crime between 1984 and 1989 is taken into account, it would appear that those locations with the most MPV arrests had higher, not lower, levels of violent crime., Conclusion. “New York City’s psychedelic experiment with misdemeanour MPV arrests – along with all the associated detentions, convictions, and additional incarcerations – presents a tremendously expensive policing intervention” (p. 13).  It disproportionately punished Blacks and Hispanics and did not contribute to combating serious crime in the city. If anything it led to increased violent crime. Once again, simplistic approaches to reducing serious crime are shown not to work., Reference: Harcourt, Bernard E. and Jens Ludwig.

Canadians do not want strict mandatory minimum sentences of the kind that exist in the Criminal Code of Canada.  They prefer to leave some discretion with judges on whether the mandatory minimum sentence should be imposed.,"In Canada, as in the U.S. and other countries, legislators from various political parties have been enthusiastically implementing mandatory minimum sentences for certain serious offences.  Although they often make the argument that these will reduce crime (by way of general deterrence), the evidence strongly refutes this argument (e.g., see Criminological Highlights, 1(6)#7, 3(4)#6, 6(2)#1).  But politicians have another justification: they often suggest that the public wants mandatory minimum sentences.  For these and other reasons, then, mandatory minimum sentences may be more effective politically than they are as crime prevention measures. It would appear, however, the public’s support is more nuanced than the politicians would lead us to believe., This paper looks carefully at public support for mandatory minimum sentences in the context of a larger inquiry into public attitudes to sentencing.  Over the past 30 years, about 60-80% of Canadians have told pollsters that they want the courts to hand down harsher sentences. When asked which specific crimes are sentenced too leniently, about 80% of Canadians in a recent poll answered ‘gun crimes.’ These are interesting findings in a country in which there are no national sentencing statistics for crimes generally or for crimes involving firearms., However, Canadians do not appear to be as enthralled with deterrence-based sentencing as some might expect. When asked to rate the importance that they would give to various sentencing purposes, Canadians’ most popular choice was “making offenders acknowledge and take responsibility for crime.”  General deterrence ranked a distant fifth in Canadian citizens’ priority of sentencing purposes., Respondents to a nationally representative survey were given a detailed definition of ‘mandatory minimum sentence’ and then were asked to name which offences, other than murder, had mandatory minimums.  43% could not name any of the 31 offences that carry mandatory minimums, and only 19% mentioned impaired driving offences.  Only 6% mentioned any of the firearms offences that currently have these penalties.  Nevertheless, 58% of the respondents in the national poll indicated that they thought mandatory minimum sentences were a ‘good idea’ – a finding that echoes similar research in the U.S. and Australia., After being asked a number of other questions relating to mandatory minimum sentences, respondents were asked whether they “agree or disagree that there should be some flexibility for a judge to impose less than the mandatory minimum sentence under special circumstances” (p. 96).  The results show “strong support for the concept of judicial discretion” (p. 96): 74% agreed with the idea (30% strongly agreed, and 44% somewhat agreed).  Similarly, 72% agreed with the idea that a court should be allowed to impose a lesser sentence if the judge had to provide a written justification for a decision in which he or she goes below the mandatory minimum sentence. Sixty-eight percent agreed with the idea that judges should be able to sentence below the mandatory minimum term “if Parliament had outlined clear guidelines for the exercise of discretion…” (p. 97)., Conclusion.  It would seem that the Canadian public wants Parliament to give some guidance on sentencing. If told that there are only two choices –  no guidance on minimum sentences or mandatory minimums –  they will choose the latter.  On the other hand, if the public is given a middle ground option of what is in effect a presumptive minimum sentence – an option similar to those available in other countries – Canadians clearly prefer a sentencing structure that blends guidance and discretion. Most Canadian politicians, however, in the past two years of minority governments, appear to have been too busy to listen carefully to Canadians to find out what kind of sentencing structure they prefer.  The public, it would seem, agrees with most sentencing scholars that rigid sentencing structures are likely to create unnecessary injustices., Reference: Roberts, Julian V., Nicole Crutcher and Paul Verbrugge.

Giving prosecutors the power to determine whether a youth is tried in youth or adult court has no deterrent impact on crime.,", The use of adult court for juveniles is frequently seen as a solution to the problem of youth crime.  However, various studies have shown that those youths who are tried in adult court are at least as likely to re-offend as are comparable youths tried in youth court (see Criminological Highlights, 1(3)#2, 1(5)#5, 2(4)#3, 3(5)#5, 5(5)#3).  In addition, it has been shown that when legislatures make blanket decisions to exclude certain types of offenders from juvenile court, there is no general deterrent effect of this legislative change (Criminological Highlights 8(4)#7).  This study examines the impact on crime of legislation that gives the prosecutor the power to decide, on a case-by-case basis, whether a case should be tried in juvenile or adult court., These so-called ‘direct file waiver laws’ were, as of 2003, in place in 14 states and the District of Columbia. Typically, they are described as being a mechanism to achieve harsher penalties than would be handed out in juvenile court.  It is not clear, however, whether youths who are ‘waived’ to adult court with such a mechanism are, in fact, punished more harshly.  Nevertheless, the theory seems to be that youths will know that they will be tried in adult court if they commit certain serious offences and will be deterred from crime as a result., This study looked at the impact on crime of the direct file laws in those 14 U.S. states in which they had been implemented.  Using an interrupted time series design, the study separately examined each state’s monthly violent crime juvenile arrest rate (as well as, in another set of analyses, the state’s homicide rate).  If an effect was found, then the same type of analysis was carried out on two nearby states that had not implemented ‘direct file’ or ‘statutory exclusion’ procedures. The period of time that was the focus of the study was a period of general decline in arrests of juveniles for violent crimes.  Hence, it was important that the study use statistical techniques that took into account these pre-existing trends and examined drops in crime that were larger than one would have expected, given the general decline already in place., Looking at total crime, in 9 of the 14 states there was no effect whatsoever.  In four states there was an increase in crime after the direct file provisions were brought in and in one state there was a decrease.  When homicide was examined, the only significant change (in one of the 14 states) was an increase in one state. This increase, although immediate, was only temporary. Given that there was no explanation for these seemingly random effects (especially the increases in crime that coincided with the ‘tough’ laws),  the conclusion that “direct file waiver laws have had little [deterrent] effect on violent juvenile crime” (p. 1467) appears to be a reasonable inference from the overall findings.  Similarly, the conclusion that “there is no evidence in support of a deterrent effect on homicides committed by juveniles resulting from direct file waiver laws” (p. 1466) flows directly from the findings., Conclusion.  The U.S. Supreme Court, in a recent decision holding that youths under age 18 who commit homicide should not be executed, “restated the Court’s position… that the same characteristics which make juveniles less culpable than adults are the same characteristics that make them less susceptible to being deterred” (p. 1469).  Given the almost complete absence of data supporting the presumed deterrent impact of ‘direct file’ waiver laws, it would seem that, once again, social scientists have demonstrated that politicians cannot reduce crime with simple deterrence-based legislative initiatives., Reference: Steiner, Benjamin and Emily Wright (2006).  Assessing the Relative Effects of State Direct File Waiver Laws on Violent Crime: Deterrence or Irrelevance?

Are immigrants responsible for youth gangs in Toronto?,", Youth gangs in Toronto and other Canadian cities have received a lot of attention in the past few years, in part because of a relatively small number of highly visible violent acts.  One problem in understanding the nature of gangs is that there is no single definition of what constitutes a gang (see Criminological Highlights 3(1)#5, 4(1)#8).  What distinguishes a group of youths from a gang of youths?, This study surveyed approximately 3400 high school students and 400 youths living on the street in Toronto during a two year period ending in 2000.  Consistent with census data for Toronto, almost half (46%) of the high school students were not born in Canada and about half of those born outside of Canada had lived in Canada for less than five years. Fewer than half (45%) identified their racial background as ‘white’ or European.  Although 11% of the high school students and 27% of the street youth indicated that they had ever belonged to a gang, only 5.7% of the high school students and 16.4% of the street youths indicated that they were, at the time of the survey, gang members., The term ‘gang’ generally implies involvement in criminal activity. One rarely, for example, hears references to a gang of violinists, bridge players or even NHL hockey players. However, of the 11% of high school students who indicated that they had at one point been a member of a gang, about a third – 3.5% of the total sample – indicated their involvement in the gang was only social.  Indeed, about a quarter of the students who were current gang members appeared to be only involved in ‘gangs’ only for social rather than criminal activities. Although substantial portions of ‘gang members’ were engaged in illegal activities within the gang context (e.g. 39% admitted to selling drugs, 40% engaged in property crime, 57% fought against other gangs) gang membership provided other benefits as well.  Most (78%) of the gang members indicated that they used the gang for protection. Many gang members (64%) played sports, socialized (83%), or went to parties or clubs (73%) with other gang members., Not surprisingly, current gang members were considerably more likely than former or social gang members to indicate that they had been victims of crime in the previous 12 months. In addition, although about a quarter of the former gang members or non-gang members reported that they had been in a physical fight in the last year, most (91%) current gang members reported having been in a fight., Canadian-born high school students were more likely than foreign born students to report that they were currently members of gangs (5%, 4%, respectively).  There were, however, group differences in the likelihood of involvement in gangs, with 8% of Black youth, 7% of Hispanic youth, 6% of Aboriginal youth but only 4% of white youths reporting criminal gang involvement.  Furthermore, the longer immigrants had spent in Canada, the more likely it was that they had been involved in gang activities. Nevertheless because of the size of the white community in Toronto, most gang members in Toronto (36%) are white, with 26% being black, and no more than 11% belonging to  any of four other groups (Aboriginal, South Asian, Asian, or Hispanic).   Blacks, Aboriginal, and Hispanic gang members were most likely to report being from poor families and/or living in public housing. Gang members were more likely than others to come from single parent households. In addition, gang members were more likely than others to believe that their group suffered from discrimination., Conclusion. Gang membership is more prevalent among the poor and certain disadvantaged racial minority groups. It is, however, more or less independent of current immigration status. “The implication is that social policies designed to reduce serious gang activity should target those disenfranchised segments of the population that suffer from the greatest levels of inequality and social disadvantage – regardless of immigration status” (p. 34)., Reference: Wortley, Scot and Julian Tanner (2006).

"Controlling for pre-existing differences in their offending and substance use patterns, youths who start working at age 16 while still in school are not more likely than other youths to be involved in crime or drug abuse.  For some youths, taking on work may reduce offending.",", Although ‘getting a job’ was once seen as an all-purpose cure for adolescent problems, research carried out in the past 20 years has suggested that taking on paid work may increase the likelihood of youths experiencing various social problems: absenteeism, doing poorly in school, and having a relatively high likelihood of involvement in delinquency and alcohol or drug use. The problem, of course, is that there are large pre-existing differences between those who work while still in high school and those who do not. These pre-existing differences may account for the relationship between being involved in paid work and delinquent behaviour., This study controls for pre-existing differences in offending patterns by examining the ‘trajectories’ of substance use and criminal behaviour in a representative sample of American youths. They were interviewed repeatedly from age 11 to age 17.  Youths were divided into four statistically distinct patterns – youths who were low rate offenders throughout the period ending at their 16th birthday, youths who started off as low rate offenders but soon increased their rates of offending somewhat, youths who started offending at a relatively high rate at age 11 but then showed declines, and youths who started their involvement in offending early and continued to increase their rates of offending until their 16th birthday. There were, then, four ‘trajectories’ of criminal behaviour, and four ‘trajectories’ for substance abuse resulting in a total of 16 groups when these two forms of behaviour were combined., The study examined the offending pattern of those youths who had not worked prior to their 16th birthdays.  The main comparisons were between those who, shortly after their 16th birthdays, started paycheque-generating work averaging more than 20 hours a week and those who did not start working during the year following their 16th birthday. Without imposing any controls for pre-existing differences between these two groups, overall rates of offending and substance use were higher for those who were working.  However, when the effect of the different patterns of offending were controlled for, and those who started working substantial numbers of hours after age 16 were, in effect, compared to others who had similar offending backgrounds but did not take on paid employment at age 16, there were no overall effects of working on crime or substance use., Moreover, when looking at the group of youths whose offending started early and continued to increase until their 16th birthdays, taking on work at age 16 appeared to reduce their rates of offending. “These results suggest that the effect of intensive work during the school year may not be uniform, but it is dependent on the prior developmental history of the worker.  That is, the effect of work on subsequent behaviour depends on the youth’s developmental history” (p. 84-5)., Conclusion. “The apparently harmful effects of intensive work [found in previous studies] appears to be largely due to pre-existing differences in the developmental trajectories of the problem behaviour of first-time intensive workers at age 16 compared with their counterparts who refrain from intensive work” (p. 87-8).  Indeed, “working intensively may be helpful… for some youth who at any early age are at risk of antisocial behaviour” (p. 88)., Reference: Apel, Robert, Shawn Bushway, Robert Brame, Amelia M.

Residency restrictions imposed on sex offenders in the community make little sense.,", “One of the most hotly debated issues in criminal law today is how to manage the perceived risk of sex offenders [who are living] in the community” (p. 317).  Aside from concerns about the nature of their offences, sex offenders are believed to have very high rates of recidivism, notwithstanding the fact that their rates of recidivism are in reality no different from those of other offenders (see Criminological Highlights, 3(3)#3, 5(1)#4, 6(3)#3, 6(6)#8, 8(3)#8). Indeed, the level of concern about sex offenders appears to be higher than that associated with violent offenders, more generally., One of the problems shared by all of the ‘special’ procedures for sex offenders is that most sex offences (notably those in which children are the victims) involve offenders known to the victim. Nevertheless,  most of the special procedures that have been put in place in various jurisdictions implicitly assume that sex offences are committed largely by offenders not known by their victims.  These include registries and public notification laws (see Criminological Highlights 4(1)#2, 5(6)#1), residence restrictions (Criminological Highlights 7(4)#4) as well as incapacitative approaches such as civil commitment (Criminological Highlights, 7(2)#7).  This paper examines residence restrictions, noting that many of these restrictions are likely to impair safe reintegration of offenders into their communities., Restrictions on where offenders can live – such as the restrictions in Illinois which prohibit offenders from living within certain distances of such institutions as schools or day care centres for the rest of their lives – mean that former offenders can be, and have been, restricted from living with their parents. In one Illinois case, a man who had been convicted of a sex offence in 1987 when he was 18 was charged in 2002 with violating a law the state had put in place in 2000. He was living with his mother in a house owned by her that was within 500 feet of a school. Since his 1987 conviction, he had committed no further sex offences.  He had lived in that house for all of his non-incarcerated life including about 10 years after his conviction. Appeals courts upheld the prohibition on him. Sex offenders are also prohibited from living in federally subsidized public housing., These laws appear to be based on the assumption that sex offences against children largely involve offenders who are strangers to their victims and victims’ families, and that these strangers target children in their own neighbourhoods.   However, studies suggest that between 60% and 90% of sex offences against children are committed by people known to the child.  The laws also assume that sex offenders target children who live near them. One study of almost 500 ex-sex-offenders living in ordinary neighbourhoods found that none committed sex offences in their own neighbourhoods.  A restriction on residency does not, of course, mean that an offender cannot travel to or through an otherwise restricted neighbourhood., Depending on the size of the restrictions, substantial parts of cities can be out-of-bounds for ex-sex offenders.  One consequence of this is that sex offenders who try to live within these restrictive laws find themselves concentrated in those few neighbourhoods in a city that have both affordable housing and no schools, parks, playgrounds, daycare centres, etc., which form the basis of the restrictions.  These tend to be very poor neighbourhoods. One such neighbourhood in Chicago has 10% of the state’s paroled sex offenders because it is one of the few in which these offenders can live legally., Conclusion.  The approach many jurisdictions take toward sex offenders who are not in prison is to look for ways of banishing them from ‘respectable’ communities.  The idea seems to be to force former sex offenders to live elsewhere – but ‘elsewhere’ is not defined and may not exist. Generally speaking the restrictions that are placed on sex offenders are not tailored to the individual offender. Indeed they tend to be based on stereotypes (e.g., the out-of-control demon who will attack any attractive target) that have little basis in reality., Reference: During, Caleb (2006).  Never Going Home: Does it Make Us Safer?

Between 1995 and 2000 the U.S. Department of Justice dropped $8.8 billion into local municipalities so that they could hire more police officers and improve community policing. These cash grants had no impact on crime.,", Because policing, in some jurisdictions such as the U.S. and Canada, is largely controlled by local municipalities, the role of the national government in policing is limited.  In the latter half of the 1990s, however, the U.S. federal government made about 30,000 grants to 12,000 police agencies, the purpose of which was largely to hire approximately one hundred thousand additional police officers., Prior research results suggest that the funding did not put 100,000 more police on the streets. Furthermore, it is not clear that the grants program accelerated the community police movement. However, some preliminary studies suggested that the program did reduce violent and property crime.  The challenge, in any such studies, is to control for other factors that may have accounted for the association between new federal funding and a drop in crime.  One factor that had not been controlled for was pre-existing law enforcement expenditures: communities that, for one reason or another, funded their police forces generously, might show decreases in crime. This study examined the impact of these federal government grants on crime in large cities only (100,000 residents or larger), controlling for ‘standard’ correlates of crime (e.g., percents of the population who were age 18-24, poor, black, or living in a female headed household, etc.).  Seven different crime figures were examined (murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, theft, and motor vehicle theft).  The analysis took advantage of one important fact: these federal funds were not equally distributed across cities.  Some cities received no federal funding, some received a considerable amount of federal funding for additional police, etc., The results demonstrate that there were no consistent effects of additional federal funding for police organizations on any of the crimes. Indeed, a large infusion of new federal funding to police forces was just as likely to be associated with more crime as it was with less crime. In other words, the grants to support local community oriented police “had no discernible effect on serious crime during the period covered by [the] analysis, after controlling for annual fiscal expenditures” (p. 170).  Various statistical ‘checks’ on the findings were carried out to ensure that any impact of the grants program was not suppressed as a result of the particular type of analysis that was used, or because of a small number of very unusual effects in certain cities.  None of these supplementary analyses challenged the main finding: the 8.8 billion dollar federal program of funding local police departments did not affect crime., Conclusion. Multiple analyses, looking at the data in various ways, failed to find evidence that federal government grants to local police forces for the purpose of hiring more police had any impact on crime.  “It is not encouraging to find that some $8 billion of taxpayer dollars may have done little reduce crime” (p. 183).  On the other hand, the findings are not terribly surprising when one considers one other fact: Grants to these municipalities averaged only $407,515 per year. This constitutes only about ½ of 1% of fiscal expenditures for policing in these communities.  When one considers that few additional police officers can be hired with a grant of that size, and, therefore, the impact of such a grant on ‘police on the street’ at any given moment is tiny, it is not surprising that the grants had no impact on crime., Reference: Worrall, John L and Tomislav V. Kovandzic (2007).  Cops grants and crime revisited.

Support for harsh criminal justice policies and opposition to preventive crime policies within the American white community are each associated with symbolic racism.,", The media coverage of crime is often tinged with racism.  A white victim of a violent crime committed by a black offender is often highlighted (e.g., Toronto’s “Just Deserts” killing in the early 1990s or the killing of a young white woman in downtown Toronto in December 2005) but similar killings of black victims, or violent crimes committed by Whites, often receive less coverage.  It is suggested that such coverage may support a particular kind of racism – symbolic racism – which, in turn, may lead to support for harsh criminal justice policies., In contrast with overt racist behaviour, symbolic racism “stems from a blend of anti-Black affect and traditional values” (p. 438) in which Whites attribute high levels of violation of social norms to Blacks (e.g., on such dimensions as work ethic, respect for authority, self-reliance), and in which Whites view Blacks as getting too many special privileges.  This study suggests that “symbolic racism is a key determinant of crime policy attitudes” (p. 439).  Using data from white respondents to surveys carried out in Los Angeles in the late 1990s, support for tough criminal justice polices was assessed with questions related to the enforcement of the death penalty for persons convicted of murder and “three strikes” sentencing practices. Support for preventative policies was assessed with questions about reducing poverty and providing prison inmates with education and job training as ways of reducing crime., In addition to symbolic racism, various other possible explanations for support for harsh criminal justice policies (and opposition to preventative policies) were measured, including the perceived seriousness of random street violence, political conservatism, whether the respondent had been victimized, and the frequency with which the respondent watched local news. Respondents were also asked about their own theories of the causes of crime (e.g., breakdown of family structure, lack of good schools or jobs).   Symbolic racism was assessed with such questions as “Blacks are demanding too much from the rest of society” and “Discrimination against Blacks is no longer a problem in the U.S.”, When looking at support for punitive policies, the respondents’ own explanations for crime correlated with support for such policies.  Those who attributed crime to individual deficits (in contrast with structural difficulties such as lack of well-paying jobs) were more supportive of punitive crime policies. Similarly, those who described themselves as conservative and those who watched a lot of local news saw the crime problem as being more serious and in turn were more likely to support punitive policies.  However, above and beyond these effects, those who scored high on ‘symbolic racism’ were more likely to support harsh policies. The effect of symbolic racism on endorsement of punitive policies was especially strong for those whose income was lowest.  Support for preventative policies came from those who attributed crime to structural problems and from those who saw crime as coming from such factors as the breakdown of the family.  Political conservatives were less likely to support preventive policies.  Once again, however, above and beyond these factors, those who were high on symbolic racism were less likely to support preventive policies., Conclusion.  The findings suggest that “in a present-day society in which there is broad general support for abstract principles of racial equality…, the influence of racism remains important, even on ostensibly race-neutral issues like crime policy” (p. 449)., Reference: Green, Eva G.T., Christian Staerklé, and David O.

Telling jurors to disregard inadmissible evidence does not erase its impact.,", When jurors hear evidence that is not legally admissible in court, they are sometimes instructed by the judge to ignore that evidence.  Similarly, there are times when evidence (e.g., that a witness has previous criminal convictions) is admissible for one reason (e.g., to determine the credibility of that witness) but not for other reasons (e.g., to infer guilt of an accused with criminal convictions who testifies at his or her own trial).  Legal writers have always been sceptical of the ability of jurors to ignore evidence because, as one American judge noted, it requires jurors to perform  “a mental gymnastic which is beyond not only their powers but anybody’s…” (p. 470).  At the same time, court decisions (in Canada, the U.S., and elsewhere) seem to assume that such instructions can remove any improper influence of such evidence., This paper reviews 48 independent published research papers on the issue of inadmissible evidence, which report 175 separate tests of the impact of judicial instruction on verdicts.  These studies were carried out in a number of countries including Canada, the U.S., and England. Obviously these studies vary considerably on such dimensions as the nature and size of the sample, the type of case, the nature of the evidence that was presented, and the country in which the study was carried out.  It is not surprising, therefore, that in some instances the results were not entirely consistent.  The statistical technique of meta-analysis – a method of combining the results from many studies – was used in order to draw overall inferences concerning the impact of inadmissible evidence and instructions to jurors on its use.  The findings are as follows:, Conclusion.  “Taken as a whole, it is clear that judicial instructions do not effectively eliminate jurors’ use of inadmissible evidence.  Juror non-compliance is particularly likely when a reason for rejection of inadmissible evidence is not provided or rejection of the evidence is justified with an unexplained technicality, or if the evidence was illegally obtained and [the judge simply indicates it] must be dismissed.  In contrast, a smaller effect (greater impact of instruction) is apparent when judicial reasoning is provided [that describes the evidence] as unreliable, as hearsay, or as irrelevant to the case.  The data indicate that jurors resist giving up evidence that they believe is probative” (p. 487)., Reference: Steblay, Nancy, Harmon M.

"Pay now, or pay later: The immediate savings achieved from private management of juvenile correctional facilities are shown to be offset, in the long-term, by the additional correctional costs of increased recidivism.","Privately operated prisons in the U.S. house approximately 6.5% of adult prisoners and about 30% of juveniles who are in residential placements.  In the State of Florida, youth facilities are publicly run either by the state or the county, and private facilities are managed either by for-profit or non-profit organizations. Economic theory would predict that private for-profit organizations “should operate efficiently due to the profit motive, but in the absence of explicit linkages between revenues and recidivism outcomes, they might make decisions designed to increase profits at the expense of increased recidivism” (p. 554). It has also been argued that “private non-profit operators ought to have the most success at decreasing recidivism due to their organizational and programmatic flexibility, their mission focus, their use of volunteers, and their freedom from political and profit constraints” (p. 554)., This study focuses on youths 17 years or younger who had been sentenced to moderately or highly restrictive facilities in Florida (111 facilities in all). They were followed for a year after being released.  Because youths assigned to correctional facilities differ on various dimensions, it was necessary to attempt to control for other factors that could account for effects on costs and recidivism of different management structures.  Statistical controls included various characteristics of the youth (e.g., gender, race, age at first offence, length of stay in the facility, offence, criminal history), the youth’s own neighbourhood (e.g., crime rate, unemployment, percent incarcerated), the “restrictiveness level” of the facility, and the judicial circuit in which the youth had been adjudicated.  Recidivism was defined in two ways: after being released, the youth either had been charged or had been adjudicated delinquent., The one-year follow-up data suggested that, controlling for these various factors, youths assigned to for-profit facilities were about 5-6% more likely to be adjudicated delinquent after they were released, and about 6-8% more likely to be charged than were youths assigned to county, state, or private non-profit facilities. These other three management arrangements did not differ substantially in their recidivism rates. These results are similar to others that have been reported (See Criminological Highlights 7(3)#3, 5(2)#1, 2(5)#2). 
 
However, there were substantial immediate cost savings to the state by placing youths in the for-profit facilities. Taking into account the different types of youths sent to the various types of facilities, the cost of housing a youth in the for-profit facilities was estimated to be lower than the costs of state, county or private non-profit facilities.  However, the cost savings come with a price. “Using a series of conservative assumptions concerning the future impact of the estimated differences in recidivism rates across management types, [the] cost-benefit analysis implies that the short-run savings offered by for-profit facilities over non-profit facilities are reversed in the long run due to increased recidivism rates” (p. 582).  The county operated facilities which were cheaper to run than state facilities also showed a long-term cost savings over the for-profit facilities., Conclusion. Youth facilities run by for-profit companies were less expensive than state, county, or non-profit facilities.  However, the additional correctional costs that would derive from higher recidivism rates would suggest that, in the long term, there would be no real savings to the state from using private for-profit facilities.  Indeed, the fact that other costs (social as well as prosecutorial) were not included in the equation would suggest that nobody but the for-profit company benefited from for-profit management of youth facilities in Florida., Reference: Bayer, Patrick and Pozen, David E.  (2005) The Effectiveness of Juvenile Correctional Facilities: Public Versus Private Management.  Journal of Law and Economics, XLVIII, 549-589., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV8N1.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-8-no-1-%E2%80%93-june-2006,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 8, No. 1 – June 2006",Regular Issue,2006
"The State of Florida was wrong when, in 2004, it announced that a new law that imposed mandatory minimum sentences for certain gun crimes had been directly responsible for a 28% reduction in violent gun crime rates.",", During the 1990s, serious crime in most parts of the United States decreased.  When crime rates are declining, politicians are often quick to claim that the policies they implemented are responsible for the decrease.  Florida, in 1999, brought in a law that required minimum sentences of 10 years, 20 years, or life in prison for certain gun crimes. Speaking about the effects of this law in his testimony before a Canadian House of Commons Committee in November 2005, a prosecutor from the State of Florida asserted that “In the 10-20-Life period, violent crime is down 30%.... fewer people were robbed… fewer people were killed… I'm a prosecutor. I'm in the courtroom every day. These laws are good.”  Given what is known about the lack of impact of mandatory minimum sentences on crime elsewhere (e.g., Criminological Highlights, 6(2)#1, 5(2)#2,3(4)#6,7(3)#6), this assertion is surprising. This study examines the hypothesis that the change in penalty structure in Florida was responsible for a reduction in crime., Crime generally, and violent crime in particular, had been decreasing in Florida since about 1990. Indeed, the rate of decrease appeared to be somewhat higher before the change in the law as compared to after. Indeed, sophisticated statistical analyses demonstrated, contrary to the prosecutor’s claims,  that there was no real evidence of a decrease associated with the timing of the change in the law.  These analyses also demonstrated that results are “highly sensitive to when you start calculating the percent change. and this is especially true in Florida’s case because some percent change calculations used by the state of Florida to assess [the] 10-20-Life [minimum sentence law] use data from the years before the passage of the law.  Because total crime and homicides were high in these time periods, the use of data from these years as a base for calculating change is likely to inflate the apparent impact of [the law]” (p. 792)., However, there is a more important general point to be made: “Simple before/after comparisons cannot tell the public definitively whether the law was the cause of the change in crime.  Many other factors that were occurring at the same time could also have led to changes in crime rates” (p. 793). These issues underscore the problems associated with making sweeping claims about a law’s effects in the absence of rigorous analyses that are sensitive to the possibility that other factors may be responsible for a drop in crime., Conclusion. In this case, it is almost certain that the imposition of harsh sentences for crimes carried out with firearms had no impact on crime rates. Nevertheless, Florida is being held out as another example of how ‘tough’ criminal justice policies can reduce gun crimes.  As has been shown in studies of other cities – New York, Boston, and Richmond, Virginia (Criminological Highlights, 7(5)#2, 7(6)#1) – it is easy to make claims of effectiveness when crime is already decreasing. It is much harder to develop and implement policies that actually have an impact on crime., Reference: Piquero, Alex R. (2005).

Those interested in keeping a mafia-type organization from successfully establishing itself in  their communities might do better by focusing more on the “demand” for a mafia than on the “supply” of potential mafia leaders.,", Until the early 1990s, the dominant theory explaining the success of mafia-type organizations in various parts of the world was that they were the product of social and economic backwardness and chaos. More recently it has been shown that “mafias emerge in modernizing societies that are undergoing economic expansion but lack a legal structure that reliably protects property rights and settles business disputes” (p. 412). Mafias “are groups specializing in providing criminal protection to both the underworld and the ‘upper world,’ and in several ways their actions parallel state action” (p. 412).  In that sense, they can be seen as providing genuine services such as protection from extortion by others, elimination of competitors, protection against theft, etc.  Why, then, are mafias successful in setting up organizations in new territories in some instances, and unsuccessful in others? This paper suggests that “state failures at the time of significant changes in the economy can open up opportunities for governance-type activities on the part of the mafia, including protection, regulation, dispute resolution, and taxation” (p. 414)., This paper examines attempts by an Italian mafia ‘family’ that has been located in southern Calabria, Italy since the late 19th century to establish mafias in two locations in northern Italy. One of these attempts was successful, the other not.  The successful attempt at transplantation occurred in a town in which the demographic composition had changed dramatically, with the influx of a substantial number of people having been born outside of the province. As a consequence of this population increase, a demand for new housing emerged, which resulted in a construction boom. There were two important consequences of a sudden expansion of the construction business: (1) A shortage of skilled workers (particularly in the construction industry) led to competition for skilled immigrant workers who, in various ways, were hired illegally. (2) Without legitimate sources of protection in the case of disputes “a demand… emerged for an alternative, non-state source of protection” (p. 427). The existing institutions of civil society were not adequate to keep the mafia from becoming entrenched.  By protecting employers and ensuring work for migrants, support for the establishment of a local mafia was ensured., The unsuccessful attempt by members of the Calabria-based mafia occurred in a city that had also expanded substantially, but where most of the expansion had been the result of movement of people from neighbouring areas. The wealth of the city came largely from creating an export market of goods (e.g., furniture, shoes) and services requiring high levels of skill.  In the early 1970s, when some prominent people received threats and demands for money, and there were large scale thefts of truckloads of furniture, the local mafia leaders suggested that they could provide protection from such occurrences. However, the mafia were unable to establish themselves as protection providers because state and civil structures were seen as being capable of dealing with the problem. In effect, there was no demand for mafia services. Local civil society, characterized by strong interpersonal trust among citizens, effective state protection, and the existence of legitimate employment opportunities was quick to rally against outside criminal organizations.  In the end these features did not create ‘space’ for a mafia to move in: new immigrants found legal employment, and “employers would not benefit from the creation of a cartel… since they were mainly exporting their goods to diverse markets in northern Europe and the U.S.” (p. 438)., Conclusion.  “Demand for criminal protection seems to be the key factor that links cases of successful transplantation” (p. 438) of mafias.  Where “the state failed to create a system to adjudicate disputes quickly and effectively, thereby leaving significant sectors of the emerging market economy unprotected” there was a vacuum that could effectively be filled by a mafia.  “It is the state’s failure to offer effective legal protection (and to ensure the existence of avenues for legitimate employment) that sets in motion a chain of events that might give rise to a new mafia” (p. 440)., Reference: Varese, Federico (2006).

Residents of neighbourhoods in which the police have cracked down on gangs do not appear to experience lower levels of fear of being victimized.,", The American “Weed and Seed” programs appear to be based on the notion that by encouraging and enabling the police to remove offenders from neighbourhood streets (the ‘weed’ phase), residents will be able to take more control of their communities.  Then, by providing various programs (the ‘seed’ phase), communities will eventually become safe without the need of special police interventions.  Aside from the question of whether the programs have direct effects on reducing crime, possible unintended consequences of such programs have not been examined., This study examined the impact on the perception of safety of a “weed and seed” program in one neighbourhood in Santa Ana, California.  Interviews with residents were carried out 1 or 2 years prior to, and 1 or 2 years after, a large police operation (in March 2000) in which scores of people were arrested and charged with offences.  After the police sweep, some recreation programs and a community cleanup program were implemented, though little seems to be known about how many people from the community were involved with, or benefited from, these programs., In the ‘experimental’ area in which the police action took place, the police sweep seemed to have increased the level of concern in the community about gangs. Prior to the sweep, 5.9% of the residents had concerns about street gangs.  In the years after the sweep, this increased to 21.1% having these concerns.  In contrast, in ‘control’ neighbourhoods in Santa Ana (in which there were no special police activities) complaints about gangs were fairly constant (11.7% of those interviewed in the first period and 11.4% in the second period expressed concerns). In addition, people in the ‘experimental’ neighbourhood were no more likely to change their views about the prevalence of crime and disorder problems than were people in the ‘control’ neighbourhoods., Residents of Santa Ana were also asked whether they feared being a victim of crime. Prior to the arrest sweep, 9% of those in the ‘experimental’ neighbourhood thought that they were likely to be a victim of crime.  After the sweep, this proportion doubled (18.3%).   In contrast, in other Santa Ana neighbourhoods, the perceived likelihood of victimization went down slightly., Conclusion.  The results of the analysis of the program “failed to reveal any positive effects… in terms of citizens’ perceptions of the threats confronting their neighbourhoods” (p. 84).   Indeed, the data suggest exactly the opposite, with citizens’ predictions that they were likely to be victims of violent crime increasing.  Given the evidence that suggests that such police actions are unlikely to have long term impacts (See Criminological Highlights, 7(6)#1, 7(5)#2), it would appear that caution should be exercised in assuming that no harm can come from such programs., Reference: Bridenball, Blaine and Paul Jesilow.

"Offenders who return to disadvantaged neighbourhoods are more likely to re-offend than are those who return to less disadvantaged neighbourhoods, even when the characteristics of the offenders are held constant.",", Studies that focus on recidivism risk typically focus on individual characteristics of offenders.  These studies have found, for example, that those who have large numbers of prior offences, substance abuse problems, or little education are more likely to re-offend than those without these characteristics.  “Notably absent from recidivism studies are measures reflecting the neighbourhood contexts in which former prisoners live” (p. 166).  Since the characteristics of neighbourhoods are known to influence the likelihood that an individual will offend – above and beyond the characteristics of that individual –  it is logical to expect that the neighbourhood to which offenders return will have an impact on their potential to recidivate., This study looks at 5002 offenders who were receiving community supervision in the Portland, Oregon area. Some were on probation, but others had been released from prison.  Using arrests within a 12-month period as the measure of recidivism, it was found that the usual set of individual characteristics – e.g., being male, Black or Native American, being released from prison (as opposed to simply serving time on probation), being a property or drug offender, and having larger numbers of prior arrests – increased the likelihood of re-offending., The major contribution of this paper, however, was that the researchers obtained measures of economic disadvantage of the (first) neighbourhood in which an offender lived after being convicted and released into the community.  An index of neighbourhood disadvantage was created for each census tract using four measures: (i)  the proportion of people living on public assistance, (ii) the proportion living below the poverty level, (iii)  the proportion unemployed, and (iv) the median income. Above and beyond characteristics of the individual offenders, this “economic disadvantage” measure of the community in which the offender subsequently lived proved to be a predictor of recidivism: those offenders who lived in disadvantaged communities were more likely to recidivate.  The probability of being re-arrested for an average offender living in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods was .59.  For an average offender returning to an average community, the recidivism rate dropped to .50.  Average offenders returning to the most advantaged neighbourhoods had a probability of re-arrest during the first year of only .42., Conclusion.  Policy approaches to recidivism typically focus solely on changes that might be made to offenders while they are under the control of correctional authorities. These data suggest that for those convicted of crimes, the neighbourhood in which they subsequently reside is also important.  Those offenders who end up living in disadvantaged neighbourhoods are considerably more likely to re-offend.  “Given the challenges of prisoner re-entry, particularly in a ‘get tough on crime’ era, former prisoners are even more reliant than ever on community services and personal networks not just to comply with the terms of their supervision but also to curb recidivism” (p. 189).  Investing in poor communities, then, can serve to reduce re-offending by those returning to these neighbourhoods., Reference: Kubrin, Charis E. and Eric A.

"A study of drug enforcement in Seattle, Washington, demonstrates that black Americans are over-represented in drug arrests because the local police focus their drug-enforcement efforts on black users of crack cocaine.",", The over-representation of black Americans among those arrested, convicted, and imprisoned for drug offences is well established.  The difference between the arrest rates for white and black Americans changed dramatically between 1980 and 2000.  In 1980, the arrest rates were approximately 650 and 350 per 100,000 population for Blacks and Whites, respectively.  By the end of the century these had increased to 2907 and 463 per 100,000 population for Blacks and Whites, respectively.  Why black Americans are (increasingly) over-represented is, however, less clear., This paper explores various explanations for the over-representation of black Americans among those arrested for drug offences in Seattle, Washington.  The explanations that have been offered include disproportionate drug use, differential visibility of drug transactions (e.g., open air vs. indoor), the disproportionate enforcement focus on certain drugs (e.g., crack cocaine), and a special focus on black crack users.  Using a combination of systematic observations of drug transactions on the street, drug treatment records, interviews with drug users, and arrest records, the paper examines each of these explanations., Drug-use data suggested that in Seattle, Blacks are over-represented as users of crack cocaine, whereas Whites are over-represented as users of methamphetamine.  Although black residents were disproportionately likely to be users of crack cocaine, they were even more likely to be arrested for this drug than their drug-use rate would predict. One reason for this was that almost 50% of all simple drug-possession arrests were for crack cocaine. Two-thirds of all “buy-bust operations” were focused on crack cocaine. Black residents constituted 63% of those arrested for crack cocaine, but only 22% of those arrested for any other drug. (Blacks constitute 8% of the Seattle population).  Looking at estimates of the number of outdoor drug transactions for four serious drugs (methamphetamine, crack, powder cocaine, and heroin), it appeared that crack cocaine accounted for approximately a third of the transactions, but 75% of the arrests.  “Law enforcement’s overwhelming focus on crack does not appear to be a function of the frequency with which crack is exchanged…” (p. 432).  Nor does it appear to be that those involved in the use or sale of these drugs are more likely to be involved with violence or guns.  In addition, these arrests on the street involved only small amounts of drugs and money. Measured as the amount of money or drugs apprehended per officer-hour spent, these were very inefficient police activities when compared to “search warrant arrests” (p. 434). By focusing on outdoor drug activities and on crack cocaine, police inevitably end up focusing on black residents.  In addition, it appeared that in two neighbourhoods in which drug transactions were observed by the researchers, Blacks were more likely to be arrested than their involvement in drug transactions would suggest. The main determinant of the over-representation of black residents, however, was the focus on crack cocaine, not the location of the arrests., Conclusion.  The choice of which drugs the police should target in their enforcement efforts inevitably determines which groups are likely to be arrested for drug offences. The focus on crack is not explicable solely in terms of where drug transactions take place or the frequency with which transactions take place.  “It appears that both the focus on crack and the over-representation of Blacks… among those arrested for crack and other drugs reflect a racialized conception of ‘the drug problem’… It appears that law enforcement practices in Seattle reflect a widespread cultural script about who and what constitutes the drug problem” (p. 436)., Reference: Beckett, Katherine, Kris Nyrop, Lori Pfingst, and Melissa Bowen.  Drug use, Drug Possession Arrests, and the Question of Race: Lessons from Seattle.  Social Problems, 52 (3), 419-441., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV8N1.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-8-no-1-%E2%80%93-june-2006,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 8, No. 1 – June 2006",Regular Issue,2006
Being arrested does not increase youths’ perceptions that they will be caught in the future.,", Deterrence theory assumes that in considering whether to commit an offence, people estimate their likelihood of being apprehended and the expected punishment they would receive if this occurs.  But how do people know what their likelihood of being apprehended is?  One might assume that to some extent it would depend on their own personal experiences.  This study examines the impact of being arrested on youths’ estimates of whether they would be arrested by the police if they chose to offend., The objective certainty of being apprehended for offending is likely to be impossible for potential offenders to estimate.  Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that if they were to be apprehended, offenders would be likely to modify their perception of the likelihood that they would be apprehended in the future., This study examines data from a panel study of American young people who were interviewed when they were 17-23 years old and again four years later.  When first interviewed, they were asked to estimate the likelihood that they would be arrested (a) if they attacked someone, and (b) if they stole something worth more than $50.  Four years later they were asked the same questions.  The measure of interest was, essentially, the change in certainty.  Respondents were also, at each point in time, asked to report any offences they had committed during the year prior to the interview. They were also asked to indicate the number of close friends whom they believed had offended.  In the second interview, they were also asked if they had been arrested since the previous interview., The main results are simple to summarize: the number of times the respondent was arrested between the two interviews was unrelated to the respondent’s estimate of the change in the perceived certainty of apprehension.  This was true for both theft and violence-related offences. In other words, being arrested did not change a person’s view of the likelihood of arrest in the future. Furthermore, this lack of effect was found both for those with relatively high rates of offending prior to the first interview and those with relatively low rates of offending. The analyses included the young person’s self-reported offending as a control.  Those who reported a high rate of offending were less likely to think that they would be apprehended in the future. The explanation for this finding is simple: successful punishment avoidance appears to reduce perceived certainty of apprehension.  But being apprehended does not affect one’s perceived likelihood of being caught.  Perhaps young people figure that they have learned from their mistakes and any “deterrent” impact is counteracted by the belief that they now know better what not to do., Conclusion. “The finding that arrests do not affect certainty perceptions contradicts one of the central tenets of deterrence theory.  Punished individuals should be less apt to recidivate at least partly because they increase their estimate of the certainty of punishment” (p. 20).  This does not occur, at least with people of this age and when asking about ordinary offences.  It would appear that being apprehended does not cause a youth to ‘learn the lesson’ that ‘crime does not pay.’, Reference: Pogarsky, Greg, KiDeuk Kim, and Ray Paternoster (2005).

Boot camps were once seen as being effective largely because they appealed to political leaders’ views of what they considered to be ‘common sense.’  The fact that boot camps have begun to fall into disrepute demonstrates that occasionally systematic knowledge can trump incorrect ‘common sense.’,", In various parts of the world, boot camps were seen by politicians as a useful solution to the problem of offending by young males.  Ontario, for example, opened its own boot camp in the late 1990s (as part of the then government’s ‘common sense revolution’—see Criminological Highlights 4(1)#1).  In the United States, boot camps were seen as a way of changing offenders by way of military discipline “that would not be mistaken for lenient, bleeding-heart corrections” (p. 57).  However, “corrections is a field in which quackery is pervasive” (p. 55; see also Criminological Highlights 6(2)#4) and the early love affair with boot camps demonstrates that common sense is sometimes more persuasive than knowledge. Part of the attraction of boot camps was they used a language that “resonated with the prevailing political climate” (p. 58).  Hence, there was no need to look at evidence of whether such regimes were effective: “common sense” told their advocates that “the discipline of military experience would transform the immature and wayward into mature and contributing citizens” (p. 58)., In the early days of infatuation with boot camps, there were, of course, no data directly on the question of their effectiveness.  But the first evaluations suggesting that they were not effective were met with scepticism from the boot camp advocates.  For example, a spokesman for the Governor of Georgia, when confronted with studies showing the ineffectiveness of boot camps said that “We don’t care what the study thinks.”  It is clear that what the study “thought” (or showed) was less important than the data-free thoughts of an elected official. In effect, what was said is that intuitions and ideology, in corrections, should trump systematic information., Why, then, are boot camps falling out of favour after (only) 20 years?  It would seem that part of the problem is that “boot camps are portrayed as places where youths are humiliated and potentially abused; as places where adult bullies are given unfettered power over vulnerable charges…” (p.65). This may not have been as attractive to the public as some had thought.  “But the most devastating blow to the boot camp movement has come from another source: evidence-based corrections.”   Over time, the accumulated evidence (e.g., see Criminological Highlights 7(5)#7; 3(4)#3, 2(4)#1) became more and more difficult to ignore: boot camps were consistently shown to be no more effective than traditional correctional regimes. And the evidence was hard to ignore, given how consistent it was., Conclusion.  Although boot camps varied considerably from place to place, there were overall similarities in this form of correctional program.  Hence, researchers could evaluate a “boot camp” and place these findings in a larger research context of other studies that had found that boot camps didn’t work.   As time went on, it became more and more clear that the “boot camp” was no more effective than any other form of prison.  At some point, in light of the accumulated evidence, the “common sense” approach to corrections that justified boot camps began to have as much credibility as the “common sense” practice a few centuries ago of bleeding sick people to rid them of disease., Reference: Cullen, Francis T., Kristie R.

"Negative experiences with the police have large negative impacts on the way in which the police are rated by ordinary citizens.  Positive interactions with the police, however, have little, if any, impact.","Most police administrators would agree with the assertion that it is important that the public have confidence in the police.   There are data that suggest that individual level factors (e.g., race and age), neighbourhood-level factors, as well as individual experiences with the police affect the way in which the police are evaluated.  This paper explores the hypothesis that the relationship between how people feel that they have been treated by the police and their evaluations of the police are asymmetrical. That is, citizens may have expectations that they will be treated fairly and appropriately by the police which would mean that positive encounters with the police would have little (additional) impact on their evaluations of the police. On the other hand, a single bad experience with the police may “deeply influence people’s views of [police] performance and even legitimacy” (p. 100)., Research on various types of encounters with the police suggests that citizens (e.g., victims) are less affected by the outcome of the encounter with the police than they are by the process – how they are treated by the police.  If the public expects professional and respectful treatment from the police, it would follow that encounters that are consistent with this expectation would have relatively little impact.  However, bad experiences with the police would be expected to have large, and lasting, impacts on people’s evaluation of the police.  Psychological research has suggested that “The lessons of bad things are learned more quickly, and forgotten more slowly, than the lessons of positive experiences” (p. 106)., In this study, residents of Chicago were surveyed and asked a number of questions about how good a job they thought their local police were doing on such matters as responding to community concerns, preventing crime, keeping order, and helping victims.  They were also asked questions about interactions with the police and how satisfied they were with the way in which the police handled the issue that led them to have contact with the police., Various factors known to affect evaluations of the police were “held constant” statistically: race, age, income, marital status, level of fear of crime, the perception of the extent of the local drug and gang problem, the perception of disorder and whether any recent interactions with the police were initiated by the citizen or the police.   After taking account of these factors, positive experiences with the police had essentially no impact on confidence in the police.  Negative experiences, however, had substantial impacts on reducing confidence in the police.   This asymmetrical effect – positive interactions with the police having little if any impact on confidence in the police, and negative interactions with the police reducing dramatically the evaluations citizens give of the police – was replicated in seven other surveys – Seattle, New York, St. Petersburg (Florida), St. Petersburg (Russian Federation), Indianapolis, Washington, D.C., and an urban sample in England & Wales., Conclusion.  “For both police-initiated and citizen-initiated encounters [with the police], the impact of having a bad experience is four to fourteen times as great as that of having a positive experience. The coefficients associated with having a good experience – including being treated fairly and politely, and receiving service that was prompt and helpful – were very small and not statistically different from zero” (p. 100).  It would appear that it is more important for police administrators interested in improving citizens’ assessments of the police to focus on avoiding negative interactions with the public than on creating opportunities for positive interactions., Reference: Skogan, Wesley G.

Intensive parole supervision programs can reduce recidivism.,", The move to intensive supervision of offenders on probation is often motivated more by punitive or control purposes than it is by motivations to change an offender.  In this context, it is not surprising that intensive supervision regimes have had relatively little impact on recidivism.  Essentially, intensive supervision programs have focused largely on (temporary) incapacitation or control of offenders (while they are still in the community) rather than on changing offenders., This study examines an “Intensive Surveillance and Supervision” (ISSP) program in New Jersey that was designed for a different reason: “State parole authorities were concerned about the lack of services for several hundred high-risk/high-need parolees” (p. 449).  The idea was to provide them with more appropriate services than a matched comparison group made up of similar offenders who were given traditional parole supervision (TPS), and to compare recidivism rates of the two groups., In addition to the simple comparison between the intensive and traditional parole regimes, the type and amount of services that were received by the parolees were monitored as was the “organizational supportiveness” of each of the 12 parole offices involved in the study. Organizational supportiveness was operationalized by assessing whether there were clearly articulated programming objectives, a commitment on the part of the office to the objectives and values of the program, presence of a director who was supportive of the program, low staff turnover, sufficient resources, and secure administrators.  The parole officers involved in intensive supervision were also assessed and categorized as being law enforcement, social work, or balanced in their orientation. Those described as “balanced” in their orientation incorporated aspects of both a law enforcement and a social work orientation., The findings were quite straightforward:, Conclusion. The results demonstrate that recidivism of parolees can be reduced by providing intensive supervision, perhaps because those receiving this added amount of attention were also more likely to receive appropriate rehabilitative services.  However, in addition, supportive offices were more effective than non-supportive offices in reducing revocation, and parole officers who were able to strike a balance between enforcement and help were more effective in helping their clients stay out of trouble., Reference: Paparozzi, Mario A. and Paul Gendreau.

"In order to understand fully current criminal justice punishments, we need to consider not only current sensibilities, but also the history of populist punishments: Death sentences in 20th century U.S. are most common in states that have a high percentage of black residents and have a history of lynchings in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.",", Vigilantism in the U.S. in the late 19th and early 20th centuries is often interpreted as an attempt “to ensure that newly freed blacks reverted to their prior subordinate status…” (p. 658).   It is clear that in many locations in the U.S. during this period, lynching was seen by many as an acceptable community response to the threat that crime and the presence of large numbers of blacks in the community were thought to present., This study examined three periods – the early 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s – in the 48 contiguous states and examined death sentences as a function of the number of lynchings and the percentage of blacks in the state.  At a simple descriptive level, it is clear that it is the interaction of these two variables that is critical to understanding the number of death sentences handed down.  In states that had a history of large numbers of lynchings (in the period 1889-1931) and a high percentage of blacks in the population (in the 1970s, 80s, or 90s), there were an average of about 20 death sentences handed down.  In those states in which the percentage of blacks was about average for the country, but the number of historical lynchings was high, there were only about 9 death sentences.  Similarly, those states with an intermediate number of historical lynchings, but which had a large black population, death sentences were also somewhat less common (about 11 in a year). It would appear that a history of lynchings combined with high levels of current racial ‘threat’ lead to high rates of death sentences., In a more detailed analysis, various other factors were controlled: the conservatism of the state (as measured by congressional voting patterns), whether the state was located in the south, religious fundamentalism, unemployment rate and  various crime rates. The effect held: “the combination of prior illegal violence directed largely against blacks and the current racial threat based on the size of the contemporary African American populations… [had] a positive relationship with recent death sentences” (p. 671-672).  This relationship held whether one was predicting all death sentences or simply death sentences imposed on African Americans., A separate analysis was carried out using a different set of data from a different source that contained different estimates of the number of lynchings. This analysis focused only on 10 southern states.  The results were the same: a history of large numbers of lynchings combined with a high proportion of the population being African American led to large numbers of death sentences being imposed by the courts., Conclusion.  It would appear that “vivid historical events continue to influence the current behaviour of important social institutions… Acts in the distant past still affect recent legal decisions about who will live and who will die… [T]he 19th century racial caste system and the violent means used to preserve it help to explain why the United States has adopted such an exceptional stance on the death penalty, as compared with the many equivalent democracies that have so emphatically renounced this punishment” (p. 674)., Reference: Jacobs, David, Jason T.

Urban neighbourhoods that are in the process of being ‘gentrified’ are likely to have relatively high levels of crime because of the social instability that results from the influx of higher income people.,", A number of studies have found that economically disadvantaged neighbourhoods have high crime rates.  Various explanations for this finding have been examined including the possibility that “community cohesion [is expected] to be low not only in disadvantaged neighbourhoods, but also in areas characterized by strong heterogeneity and instability” (p. 226-227).  This study examines the impact of gentrification – the change that occurs when there is an inflow of high income households into a previously low income neighbourhood., It could be predicted that gentrification would reduce crime because the neighbourhood as a whole would become less disadvantaged.   Alternatively, “the… inflow of new affluent residents hampers the realization of social cohesion, because many neighbours are not acquainted yet or else have known each other for a short time.  Furthermore, social distance between residents is often more pronounced in gentrifying neighbourhoods due to income differences between  old and new residents” (p. 228)., This study used Dutch victimization (survey) data combined with census data. In all, data were available for about 65% of Dutch neighbourhoods.  Various measures of the characteristics of survey respondents were used in order to control for compositional differences across neighbourhoods.  In addition, measures of general mobility in the neighbourhood, levels of neighbourhood disadvantage and ethnic composition of the neighbourhood were obtained from census data.  The main focus was the impact of change in the socioeconomic character of the neighbourhoods between 1994 and 1998 on crime rates., Above and beyond individual characteristics of the respondent (e.g., educational level, gender, age), and neighbourhood characteristics (e.g., the proportion of young people or members of non-Western ethnic minorities, or the average income of the community) there were effects of change in the socioeconomic makeup of the community.  Those neighbourhoods showing moderate or large improvements in the economic circumstances of the residents were more likely to have high levels of  violent crime, car thefts (and thefts from cars) and burglaries., Conclusion. “The chance of becoming the victim of a crime is higher not only in disadvantaged neighbourhoods, but also in neighbourhoods that are undergoing strong socioeconomic improvement….” (p. 241).  “According to social disorganization theory, such residential instability reduces the potential for collective social control, because unstable neighbourhoods yield few social contacts between inhabitants…. “In neighbourhoods where improvements are taking place, decreases in victimization can be expected only after stabilization and, possibly, homogenization of the local community” (p. 242)., Reference: Wilsem, Johan Van, Karin Wittebrood, and Nan Dirk De Graff (2006).

Another national crime prevention program did not have an impact on crime and violence.  Are there lessons to be learned?,", In 1999, the government of Finland, working through its municipalities, launched a national crime prevention program.  Local governments were expected to identify the nature of the crime problems in their communities, propose solutions, and raise money to fund those solutions. The national program would, in turn, match the funds raised at the local level.  A wide range of different programs were implemented under the overall program, including programs addressing risk behaviours (e.g., drinking and drug use) amongst youth, experiments in community policing, and programs to address learning disabilities.  Generally, the “social-preventive” model tended to dominate the programs in the communities.  The obvious question, then, is whether the overall national funding program had any impact on crime., Participation of the local communities in the national program was voluntary.  The result was that communities varied as to how involved they were in the overall program.  Some only submitted a plan for community safety.  Others applied for funding, but did not received matching funds from the national government.  Some municipalities received national funding for only one program, whereas others received multiple matching grants.   Hence communities could be described as having different levels of involvement in the overall program.  Crime rates were estimated using police crime data as well as victimization surveys.  The results using data from the crime victimization surveys suggest that levels of participation in the national crime prevention program were not related to the likelihood of crimes being reported to the police; hence police recorded crime could be used as a plausible estimate of crime.   In addition, only a subset of communities which were relatively similar were used for the main analyses., Looking at the prevalence of property crime victimizations as a function of the intensity of the involvement in the national crime prevention program, the “findings support the conclusion that there is no relationship between program participation and the decline of crime at the local level” (p. 184).  A multivariate test of the impact of the program on assault rates (and separately on property crime) showed the same effect: the level of participation in the national crime prevention program was unrelated to crime in 2003 (four years after the crime prevention program was started)., Conclusion. There was no evidence of any impact of Finland’s national crime prevention program on crime.  Obviously, there may well have been specific programs that had an impact in some locations, but the national funding program as a whole appeared to have no overall impact. Part of the reason for this failure may have been the “radically decentralized nature of the [national crime prevention program]” (p. 188).  Adequate program design and attention to what is known about crime prevention is not likely to have occurred in all communities.  Furthermore, adequate evaluations were impossible in part because of the breadth and number of different programs that were implemented. In addition, the programs were typically implemented in a manner that made it impossible for them to be evaluated. A similar study of a national funding program focused on youth crime published in Denmark in 1990 came up with similar results: “Trends in youth crime between municipalities with different levels of participation” (p. 177) in the program showed no differences in crime rates.  It would appear that in crime prevention, as in any public policy area,  intuitive beliefs in the adequacy of a program do not guarantee that the program will achieve its intended effects., Reference: Savolainen, Jukka (2005).

"Canada’s relatively stable rate of adult imprisonment appears to be the result of a unique combination of constitutional, political, historical, and attitudinal factors.",", For at least the past 45 years, Canada’s rate of imprisonment has been remarkably stable. Expressed in terms of the number of adults in custody on an average day per hundred thousand people in the population, Canada’s overall rate (federal, provincial, and including remand as well as sentenced prisoners) is about 100.  Canada’s two most obvious comparator countries, England and the U.S., have higher rates and those rates have increased dramatically over this same period., One factor that clearly does not account for this stability is the rate of reported crime. Crime increased dramatically in Canada, as it did in the U.S., from the early 1960s until the early 1990s. However, unlike the U.S., Canada’s imprisonment rates did not increase.  During this period, Canada had its share of changes in the criminal law (and in the administration of the criminal justice system).  These changes – even changes which, at first glance, would appear to lead inevitably to increases in imprisonment – did not appear to have much impact.  For example, in the mid-1990s, mandatory minimum sentences were legislated for a number of serious violent offences committed with a firearm. Changes were also made in procedures for possible release of those serving life sentences for murder. In addition, some maximum sentences were increased.   In one province (Ontario) parole releases were severely restricted for those serving sentences of less than two years.  But, in general, “the pattern depicted by these examples is one of muted or limited expression of wider punitive trends…. Canada… has largely been able to restrict or contain [the] impact [of these changes]” (p.337)., Borrowing from the language of developmental psychology, it is suggested that Canada has had fewer or muted “risk factors” for higher imprisonment levels, while at the same time a number of “protective factors” have limited the impact of factors that otherwise could have led to increased imprisonment.  These include the following:, Conclusion. “Canada’s stability in levels of incarceration since the 1960s appears to be the result of two interrelated processes” (p. 359).  Canada has avoided various factors that appear to lead to increases in imprisonment while at the same time, “Specific historical, cultural, and structural factors have largely shielded Canada from wider punitive forces. While each of these factors exerts its own impact on the limited adoption of wider punitive trends, their importance seems to reside in their interwoven nature” (p. 359)., Reference: Doob, Anthony N. and Cheryl Marie Webster (2006).  Countering Punitiveness: Understanding Stability in Canada’s Imprisonment Rate.

"Reducing society’s dependence on psychiatric hospitals increases the size of the homeless population, which, in turn, leads to increased crime and arrests by police.",", In the U.S., as in many countries, the number of publicly funded psychiatric beds has declined dramatically in the past 50 years.  For example, it is estimated that in 1960 there were 314 beds per 100,000 people in the population.  By 1990, this had declined to about 40 per 100,000.   Not surprisingly, the average stay in a psychiatric hospital showed similar declines: from about 6 months in the 1960s to about 15 days in the 1990s.  But there are spillover effects: research has shown that the number of prison inmates with prior mental health hospitalizations has increased as has the number of mental patients with arrest records.  However, it should be pointed out that there are other differences (use of prohibited drugs, fights with officers, etc.) that may account for the increased co-morbidity: hence “if mentally ill persons are overrepresented in criminal justice settings, it is not solely attributable to discriminatory treatment on the part of police, but in part, due to greater likelihood of arrest-generating behaviour” (p. 50)., This study examines “the mediating role of homelessness in the relationship between psychiatric hospital capacity and crime and arrest rates” (p. 52).  Using data from 81 U.S. cities with populations of over 50,000 in which estimates of the size of the homeless populations were available, it explored the possibility that homelessness was the result of decreased psychiatric hospital capacity which then led to increased crime and arrests., Psychiatric hospital capacity in these cities was negatively related to reported violent and property crime and arrests: as capacity went down, crime and arrests went up even when other factors (e.g., economic disadvantage) were controlled for.   Private psychiatric hospital capacity and general hospital capacity did not, on the whole, show this same relationship.  However, when homelessness was controlled for (in a multiple regression model with crime as the dependent variable), the effect of public psychiatric hospital capacity disappeared.  In other words, it would appear that the effect of lowered public psychiatric capacity on crime is due to its effect on homelessness.  Homelessness, controlling for various standard correlates of crime and controlling for psychiatric hospital capacity, had an impact on crime., When “arrest rates” were examined, homelessness again had a direct impact. High levels of homelessness led to increases in arrests, but it appeared that psychiatric hospital capacity had a direct impact as well.   It would appear that “when social control agents [e.g., the police] must deal with individuals whose behaviour may be disturbing or troublesome, in the absence of hospitalization in public psychiatric institutions as an option, arrests may be more frequent…” (p. 60)., Conclusion.  Although there are undoubtedly enormous advantages of caring for psychiatric patients in the community rather than in hospitals, it would appear that there are also costs of closing psychiatric beds: increased homelessness and increased crime and arrests. The effects on crime, however, may be diminished by addressing the homelessness issue. Reducing the size of the homeless population will also have some effect on arrest rates., Reference: Markowitz, Fred E. (2006) Psychiatric hospital capacity, homelessness, and crime and arrest rates.  Criminology, 44 (1), 45-72., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV8N2.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-8-no-2-%E2%80%93-august-2006,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 8, No. 2 – August 2006",Regular Issue,2006
"“It’s the economy, stupid.” Strong economies, more than simply low unemployment rates, can lead to lower property crime rates.",", For decades, there has been interest in the relationship between economic factors and crime.  Though the relationship of the level of economic disadvantage of groups within a community and their level of involvement in crime has been fairly well established, the relationship between macro-indicators of the state of the economy such as the unemployment rate and crime rates in a community has been less consistent.  Unemployment rates “can fail to reflect other important phenomena, such as changes in work hours, pay, and economic mobility and security…” (p. 140)., This study uses a more direct measure of aggregate economic activity: the inflation-adjusted “gross state product” for each state in the United States for the period 1986 through 2001. This is a measure of the “total production and income generated” in a state during a calendar year.  This measure is only slightly correlated with the unemployment rate. During this period, there were quite dramatic changes in the business cycle in the U.S. as a whole: in the late 1980s, the economy weakened and by 1991 the U.S. was formally described as being in a period of recession.  In 1992, the economy began growing again and continued growing until 2001., Controlling for the proportion of the population in the “crime vulnerable” ages of 17-24, the proportion of the population that was non-white, and the imprisonment rate, the data suggest that during this period the rate of property crime – but not most violent crimes – was related to changes in the business cycles.  When the economy improved, property crimes within a state declined.  Rates for the “index crimes” of burglary, larceny and auto theft also decreased as the economy improved.   This was also true of robbery – a violent crime typically committed for economic gain.  However, rates for murder, rape, and assault, were unaffected by changes in the business cycle., It was notable that the impact of unemployment was “starkly different” (p. 158) from the impact of the business cycle: unemployment rates had no impact on crime rates during this period., Conclusion. It would appear that improvements in the economy during the 1990s may be partially responsible for the decrease in property crime and robbery rates in the United States during this period. This suggests that an improving economy is more important than the unemployment rate per se, in part because changes in the overall economy are likely to affect many more people in a variety of different ways.  However, neither the strength of the economy nor the unemployment rate appeared to be related to changes in the rates of “pure” violent crimes such as murder, rape, and assault., Reference: Arvanites, Thomas M. and Robert H. Defina (2006).  Business Cycles and Street Crime.  Criminology, 44 (1), 139-164., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV8N2.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-8-no-2-%E2%80%93-august-2006,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 8, No. 2 – August 2006",Regular Issue,2006
"Changes that have taken place in the composition of American police departments – most notably increased proportions of visible minorities and women – have probably had their most important effects on the internal workings of the departments, and not on the ability of the police to do their jobs or on police-community interactions.","Police forces in the U.S. and in many other countries look different from the way they looked 40 years ago: they employ many more members of visible minority groups and women than they did in the 1960s., These changes are dramatic.  In Washington, D.C., for example, the proportion of minority police officers increased from about 20% in 1967 to about 70% in 2000.  Boston’s proportion of minority police officers increased from fewer than 5% to over 30% during the same period.  To some extent, minority police officers tend to be concentrated in lower ranks but this effect is not large and may reflect the fact that the changes have come relatively recently. For women, the change is similar except for the fact that the proportion of women in police forces generally does not exceed 25%. They, too, tend to be concentrated in the lower ranks, but on this dimension as in all others, there is a great deal of variation across police departments., The effects of these changes are, of course, harder to assess. But when one looks at studies that compare black and white police officers, for example, there do not appear to be dramatic or consistent changes that occur when a police department becomes more diversified. “The scholarly consensus is that no evidence suggests that African American, Hispanic, and white officers behave in significantly different ways” and that “police behaviour is determined by situational and departmental factors not by race” (p. 1226).  The evidence on the effects of increases in the number of women on police forces is equally equivocal. When one looks at the effects of increased diversity on the credibility of the police in a neighbourhood, it would appear that the effects are not consistent., There does, however, appear to be some evidence that the “unified occupational subculture of policing is being replaced by workplaces marked by division and segmentation” (p. 1231).  It is notable that “The decline in solidarity [of the police] does not seem to have impaired police effectiveness… [Though] police officers are a less cohesive group than they used to be…[this change] makes the internal cultures of police departments less stifling and opens up space for dissent and disagreement…. Investigators rarely find a single police perspective on any given issue, but rather a range of conflicting perspectives” (p. 1232)., Conclusion. Police forces appear to be “a striking success story for affirmative action” (p. 1234).  “By weakening the social solidarity of the police, the growing diversity of law enforcement workforces makes it more likely that departments will be able to take advantage of the special competencies of minority officers, female officers, and openly gay and lesbian officers. And by weakening the political solidarity of the police, and the uniformity of viewpoints within police departments, police diversity greatly facilitates other reforms – including civilian oversight, community policing, and systematic efforts to ameliorate racial bias in policing” (p. 1240)., Reference: Sklansky, David Alan (2006).  Not Your Father’s Police Department: Making Sense of the New Demographics of Law Enforcement.  Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, 96 (3), 1209-1243., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV8N3.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-8-no-3-%E2%80%93-november-2006,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 8, No. 3 – November 2006",Regular Issue,2006
Sentencing decisions can be affected by giving judges an opportunity to think about a randomly determined sentencing ‘standard’ at the time that the sentencing decision is being made.,", Research has demonstrated that in civil cases, “the higher a plaintiff’s request in court, the higher the award that is obtained” (p. 189) even when the evidence in the case is not related to the size of the request.  This paper takes such findings one step further and looks at sentencing judgements by experienced (German) judges and prosecutors as a function of irrelevant “standards” or “anchors” to which they were exposed.  It suggests that providing a “standard” against which to compare a sentence – even when that standard is arbitrary – creates an anchor that has an effect on judgements about what the proper sentence should be in a particular case., Participants who had an average of more than 10 years experience as judges or prosecutors were given a written case concerning an alleged rape. The participants reported that the case appeared to be quite realistic.  Facts about the case and expert testimony were provided to the judges. They were also asked to imagine that “during a court recess they received a telephone call from a journalist who directly asks them ‘Do you think that the sentence of the defendant in this case will be higher or lower than 1 year [or 3 years]?’”  Half were exposed to the higher number, half to the lower.  They were then told to imagine that they had refused to answer this question and had ended the telephone call.  They were then told that they discussed the journalist’s call with a colleague and had discussed whether the sentence that was suggested was too high, too low or just right. Finally they were asked to give their own sentencing decisions.  Those participants who had been exposed to the higher anchor gave considerably higher sentences (an average of 33 months) than did those who were exposed to the low anchor (an average of 25 months).  Both groups were fairly certain that their sentencing decisions were correct., In a second experiment, groups of experienced judges and prosecutors went through a similar scenario involving shoplifting and read that the prosecutor had randomly recommended a particular sentence.  Half were told that the recommended sentence was 9 months on probation.  The other half were told that the random recommended sentence was 3 months.  In this case – even believing that the prosecutor’s proposal was randomly determined – the judges were influenced by the recommendation: those who heard the higher recommendation gave an average of 6 months of probation whereas those who heard the lower figure gave an average of only 4 months. A subsequent study had the participants themselves determine what the prosecutor recommended by throwing dice. This, too, affected the judges’ decisions., It would appear that an irrelevant “anchor” or proposed sentence – even when this anchor or proposed sentence is randomly determined – gets people to think about a particular outcome.  Experienced judges, then, were influenced by this irrelevant factor.  One of the studies suggests that the mechanism may be that “considering a high irrelevant sentencing demand… makes incriminating arguments accessible or salient in the participant’s mind.  Because the final sentencing decision is then strongly influenced by those arguments that come to mind easily, this ultimately leads to higher sentencing decisions” (p. 197)., Conclusion.  “Even though judges typically do not throw dice before making sentencing decisions, they are still constantly exposed to potential sentences and anchors during sentencing decisions” (p. 198).  “Within and beyond the legal domain, irrelevant anchors may stem from different sources.  They may be explicitly provided, subtly suggested, self-generated, simply coming to mind, or determined by throwing dice… God may not play dice with the universe – as Albert Einstein reassured us. But judges may unintentionally play dice with criminal sentences” (p. 199)., Reference: Englich, Birte, Thomas Mussweiler, and Fritz Strack.

"Most gang control programs fail in large part because they are conceived without thought, implemented without care, and evaluated without adequate data.  Effective approaches to controlling gang crime need to focus more broadly on communities, rather than searching for, and copying, approaches to gang crime that have been shown to be failures.",", The world of gang control is littered with failures, though the nature of these failures varies. There are, for example, conceptual failures, implementation failures, failures based on a reliance on invalid “conventional wisdom,” and copycat failures. Many programs fail for all of these reasons., Nevertheless, most gang control programs are well publicized on most dimensions except for their outcome – their failure to control gangs and gang-related behaviour. The effect is that they are often described and understood as having been successful.  In reality, most failed programs are hard to describe because the manner in which they were implemented changed over time and is not well documented.  They are seen as being successful because they fit a certain “common wisdom” – a wisdom that, unfortunately, ignores most of what is known about gangs., A common theme in many failed programs is deterrence but “concepts of celerity and certainty of punishment have not penetrated the punishment severity mentality to any significant degree” (p. 91). Hence programs that tend to be based on deterrence have repeatedly been shown to be ineffective. One of the problems that has occurred in some cities is that the focus was often not on gangs per se, but on young offenders generally or on crime even more generally: “Gang prevention is not synonymous with delinquency prevention” (p. 114). What is generally needed is “having a clear model in place to guide a program, determining the proper targets for the program, and connecting the conceptual model to program implementations” (p. 123).  Typically the problem is that the focus is simply on youth “at risk” to offend despite the fact that “long-term successful gang control will not be achieved by intervention with youth but by intervention with the nature of gang-spawning communities” (p. 128).  There is no ‘one size fits all’ in gang control. Unfortunately, because there has been so much wasted effort as a result of repeating the failures of the past, we know less than we should about how to stop gang behaviour.  But we do know that “Commonly, but not uniformly, gang formation is spawned in communities or subsections of communities with poverty, discrimination, inadequate resources, and low community efficacy and where official (police, court, school, etc.) hostility is felt” (p. 247)., If one looks at gang control efforts in the last few decades, we find that there have been two broad approaches: approaches that attempt to control individual group members and approaches that focus on groups or gangs. Within each of these, one can focus on prevention, intervention, or suppression of the behaviour that is of concern. In addition, the program can approach the problem by concentrating efforts on individual youths, on group processes, on gang structures or on the community. This matrix results in 24 different possible ways to focus gang control efforts. When one looks at documented gang control efforts, most programs use only one of these 24 approaches.  The most popular approaches concentrate on individual change. Little attention is given to the community context of gangs or group processes or group structure. “People attempting to control gang problems largely ignore the fact that gangs are groups” (p. 255).  In contrast, “Gangs in the Far East are cast as group problems and in Europe as social welfare and immigration problems. Yet in America, although gangs are groups spawned in describable community contexts, we respond to them much more as requiring individual change efforts” (p. 256)., Conclusion.  It is clear that gang “control efforts must begin with carefully derived goals whose achievement can be measured….More effort needs to be concentrated on gang structures, group processes and community contexts….” (p. 261).  Data need to be gathered to understand what is happening and to learn from our experience. And of course programs need to be implemented with care.  “The overall goal would be local social control – by community members, in the community, of their own problems.”   Though such approaches may take a long time, we are where we are because of “decades of uncoordinated, inadequately conceptualized gang programming and policy” (p. 263)., Reference: Klein, Malcolm W. and Cheryl L.

The preliminary inquiry – an examination of evidence before sending a case to a ‘higher’ court – was originally designed to be a procedure to help ensure successful prosecutions.,", Violent crime in London was from time to time a cause of serious anxiety in eighteenth century England.  Official efforts to reduce the levels of robbery, as well as of burglary and other crimes against property, had a profound effect on all aspects of the criminal justice system, particularly policing, prosecution, and punishment.  Parliament passed statutes in the early eighteenth century, for example, that authorized the criminal courts for the first time to sentence convicted felons to a non-capital punishment, which led to the establishment of transportation to America and, in the second half of the century, to imprisonment as the most common sanctions imposed on serious offenders., This paper is concerned with another set of changes that also grew from the cabinet’s and parliament’s concern with the level of crime and from their provision of resources to encourage more active policing and better prosecution.  There was, in fact, very little policing in the early eighteenth century of the kind we take for granted today.  Victims might get the aid of a parish constable to take those who offended against them to a magistrate, but they got little help in identifying and apprehending the suspect and they had to pay all the costs of the prosecution.  Aspects of this long-established system began to change in the early eighteenth century when, in an effort to encourage prosecutions, parliament offered very substantial rewards for the conviction of robbers and burglars and several other kinds of offenders.  Because this gave rise to free-enterprise policing by so-called thief-takers who were largely corrupt, a new strategy was adopted in the middle of the eighteenth century when the government provided Henry Fielding and his half-brother John, both of them magistrates, with resources to establish a more official group of detective officers.  John Fielding used the government’s financial support over the thirty years before his death in 1780 to create an entirely new form of magistrate’s practice at his house in Bow Street in London., Until Fielding’s time, magistrates had been largely passive with respect to criminal justice matters.  Their duty, which had been set out in statutes two hundred years earlier, was simply to take written statements of the victim and the person accused when he received a complaint that a felony had taken place and to do the paperwork that would ensure that a trial would take place in the appropriate court.  He was not to make any enquiry into the strength or validity of the evidence but commit the accused to gaol to await the determination of his or her case before a judge and jury.  Fielding’s central ambition was to create a more active prosecution system – using the press (by then rapidly developing in London) to broadcast news about crime and policing issues, building a courtroom that accommodated a larger audience than had ever attended a magistrate’s court, and, above all, developing an aggressive form of enquiry into the evidence in the cases that came before him. These measures were aimed at strengthening the prosecution’s case in those that he sent on to trial at the Old Bailey, the central criminal court in London.  One effect of this transformation of the preliminary process was to encourage the attendance for the first time of solicitors acting on behalf of defendants at the magistrates’ courts and that in turn increased the number of barristers acting as defence counsel in trials at the Old Bailey, another set of practices we take for granted that were entirely new in the eighteenth century., Some of John Fielding’s innovations were reversed by objections from the judges after his death, most notably his encouragement of extensive pretrial publicity in the press reports of his committal hearings.  But most changes continued to develop in practice through the first half of the nineteenth century, until in 1848 they were incorporated into the Jervis Acts that laid the basis of the modern judicial hearing., Conclusion: The preliminary inquiry – a procedure now defended by those who see it as an important tool for the defence to test the prosecutor’s case and often criticized by prosecutors  – thus had its origin as a prosecutorial tool to make it easier to get evidence to help convict the accused. The original preliminary inquiry was, therefore, not designed to allow the accused person to test the Crown’s case. Indeed, magistrates did not originally judge the evidence that was brought before them. Like other features of the criminal justice system, the origins of this procedure and its effects (e.g., increasing the presence of defence counsel in magistrates courts) act as a reminder that the functions of certain aspects of this system have evolved dramatically over time., Reference: Beattie, John (2007) Sir John Fielding and Public Justice: The Bow Street Magistrate’s Court, 1754-1780.

"Crime rates among first generation immigrants in England tend to be low. The second generation, however, varies considerably with rates for some groups remaining low while those of others increase sharply.  The differences across groups may relate to the different histories and experiences of each group within the context of their new country.",", Understanding the reasons for different crime rates among immigrant groups in England is a complex task. Not only did immigrants come from different cultures but they arrived at different times and had quite different experiences on their arrival in England. The evidence seems to suggest that “Criminal offending, although low among the first generation of Afro-Caribbeans in Britain” (p. 71) “became substantially elevated among second and subsequent generations of Afro-Caribbeans, but not among the [Indians, Pakistanis, or Bangladeshis]” (p. 121)., Simple explanations do not appear to fit the data. Clearly the change in rates for some groups but not others rules out selection since the changes that occurred were in the generations that followed the initial immigration to Britain. Other simple explanations are equally problematic. For example, all groups were economically disadvantaged on their arrival.  However, “on a range of measures – unemployment, job levels, earnings, incomes, and poverty – levels of deprivation are considerably higher among Pakistanis and Bangladeshis than among Afro-Caribbeans” (p. 101). Afro-Caribbeans are more similar to Indians and African-Asians on financial measures, yet Afro-Caribbeans, and not the others, showed large increases in crime after the first generation. Educational differences, as well, do not explain these group differences. “Afro-Caribbeans were less disadvantaged in educational terms than Pakistanis or Bangladeshis at an early stage of the migration, and they made more rapid progress than Bangladeshis especially, but their crime rate increased much more rapidly” (p. 83)., Single parent families were only slightly more prevalent among Afro-Caribbeans in the early 1970s than other groups, but by the beginning of this century this had changed dramatically. While about ten percent of white women with children are single, for African Caribbean women with children, the number increases to almost half. The other immigrant groups did not show this huge increase in fatherless families., There is substantial evidence of racial discrimination against all visible minority groups in England, “although perceptions of discrimination tended to be highest among Afro-Caribbeans.  Interestingly, the most economically deprived group – Bangladeshis – were least aware of discrimination.  It is possible that “the adoption of an outgoing, integrative style among Afro-Caribbean migrants… led them to encounter more discrimination and prejudice than South Asians and to compare themselves unfavourably with reference groups in Britain rather than favourably with reference groups in the country of origin” (p. 121). In addition, it would appear that “interactions between young black people and the police… led to spiralling hostility and the stigmatization of black people as criminals” (p. 121)., Conclusion. The one thing that is clear from this case study of ethnic differences in crime patterns in England is that simple explanations – self-selection of migrants, education or economic differences or discrimination – do not explain the different crime patterns of the various groups.  It would appear that adequate explanations are more likely to be found by looking at complex interactions of the experiences and cultures of the immigrants’ countries of origins combined with the differences in experiences that the various groups had in the country they migrated to., Reference: Smith, David J.

Being imprisoned for crimes one has not committed has qualitatively different and much more serious psychological impacts on prisoners than one would expect from the literature on the effects of long-term imprisonment.,", An increasing number of prisoners are being released from prison after being ‘wrongfully imprisoned’ – having served large portions of sentences handed down for crimes they did not commit. In England two of the more celebrated cases of wrongful imprisonment were the “Guildford Four” and the “Birmingham Six” who served 15 years or more for crimes they didn’t commit. Other cases, both celebrated and mundane, have been found in most countries.  Obviously the number of people officially exonerated is small compared to all estimates of the number of wrongful convictions and wrongful imprisonments., This study summarizes psychiatric assessments of 18 men released from prison (including 5 from the “Guildford” and “Birmingham” incidents). When they were assessed, most (14) of the men had been out of prison for at least two years, two more had been out for a year, and the other two for at least 6 months.  Separate interviews were carried out with people (typically partners, siblings, or close friends) who had known the prisoners prior to their arrests. Generally speaking, the wrongfully imprisoned men had no evidence of psychiatric disorder prior to their imprisonment, though two had experienced drug overdoses and one had received treatment for anxiety., The literature on the psychological impact of long-term imprisonment “has shown little evidence of deterioration in personality, intellectual functioning, attitudes, and psychiatric morbidity associated with long term custody” (p. 14).  This is not to suggest that prison is easy or that there aren’t huge social costs in being imprisoned for long periods of time. Among other things, suicide rates in prisons are high.  In contrast to these typical findings from the “prison effects” literature, this study demonstrated that 12 of the 18 men who had experienced wrongful – not just long-term – imprisonment met the diagnostic criteria for post traumatic stress disorder. Fourteen of the 18 experienced personality changes that fit the distinct diagnosis of “enduring personality change after catastrophic experiences” (p. 22).  “Families consistently said that the men had changed – that they were not the people they used to be; they were withdrawn, unable to relate properly” (p. 22).  “Families [found] the men very difficult to live with because of their moodiness, preoccupation, irritability and withdrawal” (p. 36).  Many (13) suffered from depressive episodes and had anxiety symptoms (10 cases).  “Very little of the post release psychiatric morbidity could be explained in terms of the men’s previous histories” (p. 25)., The experience of these men met the criteria of traumatic events: what happened to them was seen by them as being incomprehensible; their connections with others were ruptured; events were (by definition) inescapable; and these wrongfully imprisoned men experienced extreme arousal, hypervigilance and sense of threat.  In addition, of course, because of the nature of their eventual release, there was no opportunity to prepare for the change back to ‘normalcy’ - their release from prison., Conclusion. The effects of wrongful imprisonment are dramatically more severe than the known effects of simple imprisonment. But little is known about the experience of ordinary prisoners after they are released from long periods in prison.  The ‘prison effects’ literature may have “failed to capture adequately and characterize the kinds of distress that are reported by long term prisoners” (p. 49) in part because the kind of measures that have been used have typically been psychological tests administered while the person was in prison.   This is particularly serious because “Changes during long-term imprisonment that are perceived as adaptive in the prison environment may not be adaptive for the outside environment” (p. 48).  These same adaptations may prove to be counterproductive in the community after release.   Clearly wrongful imprisonment can have – and perhaps usually does have – serious lasting impacts.  It is possible that, if properly assessed, we would find that these same effects result from long terms of ‘ordinary’ imprisonment., Reference: Grounds, Adrian T.  (2005).

Homicide rates in southern U.S. counties have deep historical roots. High rates of lynching within certain counties in the southern U.S. during the period 1882 to 1930 contributed to “cultural orientations that are conducive to the use of lethal violence in the present” (p. 649). These counties had higher than expected homicide rates close to a century later.,", By the end of the 19th century, lynching in the United States had become concentrated in the southern states and almost always involved black victims killed by mobs composed of whites.  Almost none of the offenders were successfully prosecuted.  This paper investigates the possibility that cultural support for lynching, as evidenced by high rates of lynching in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, could lead to cultural support for violence that would be evident decades later as high homicide rates., The findings show that southern U.S. counties with high homicide rates in the period 1986-1995 tended also to have had large numbers of lynchings between 1882 and 1930.  Even controlling for various factors known to relate to homicide rates (poverty, race and family structure, urbanization, and age structure) the relationship still held: counties with large numbers of lynchings during this period had high homicide rates in the late 20th century., The overall effect of lynching on later homicide rates, however, turns out to be accounted for, largely, by homicides committed by blacks, but not by whites.  It is suggested that for blacks the experience of lynching “represents an extraordinary instance of the ‘lack of access to formal law’ which in turn fostered ‘self-help’ cultural adaptations [within the Black community] conducive to lethal violence” (p. 649).  This is consistent with the notion that for the black community, “lynching symbolized and represented an extraordinary failure of the white-dominated legal system to offer the most basic of protections to the black population” (p. 638). Citing sociologist Elijah Anderson, the suggestion is made that “the lack of access to legal protections stimulates cultural adaptations that place a premium on the display and use of violence” (p. 638) as a means of conflict resolution.  These findings suggest that this “cultural orientation” is most likely to be created in areas where large numbers of blacks were lynched., Although there was no overall effect of lynchings on the rate of homicides committed by whites, there was one important effect involving white offenders.  Those counties with large numbers of lynchings (in the period 1882-1930) tended to have high rates of one particular kind of homicide in the latter part of the 20th century: those that “involved white offenders and black victims that emerged out of interpersonal arguments rather than the circumstances associated with predatory crimes” (p. 648). It should be remembered that most lynchings not only involved black victims and white offenders, but they also typically involved blacks who were accused of crimes against whites. “To the extent that lynching gave rise to cultural orientations supportive of violence among whites, these orientations are evidently applicable only to particular kinds of homicide: interracial homicides that evolve out of interpersonal conflicts” (p. 649)., Conclusion. The results – showing that the effects of lynchings a century ago can be seen in contemporary homicide rates – reaffirm the insight that “the past can never be erased and that the ugliest human actions cast the longest shadows” (p. 651, quoting historian William McFeely)., Reference: Messner, Steven F., Robert D.

"Compared to other groups of offenders, sex offenders are not a highly specialized group.  They are no more likely to be “specialized” offenders than are other types of offenders (i.e., those who have committed violent, property or public order offences).",", Sex offenders are the focus of many special criminal law provisions (e.g., dangerous offender laws, laws that require them to register their whereabouts after they have served their sentences).  The common assumption seems to be that once a sex offender, always a sex offender.  “These stereotyped images have been shown… to have serious negative consequences for the effective detection, treatment and control of sex offenders” (p. 205)., Several studies have found that “sex offenders… exhibit lower recidivism rates and have less extensive criminal histories” (p. 207) than other types of offenders (see, e.g.,  Criminological Highlights, 5(1)#4, 3(3)#3, 6(6)#8), 6(3)#3). This study examines data from 9806  male sex offenders released from state prisons in 15 states in 1994 and an additional 23,849 prisoners released for other violent offences, property offences, or drug and other public order (drug and other public order) offences. The data include information about offenders’ entire criminal history prior to their release from prison in 1994 and in the three years following release. Hence it was possible to look at the likelihood that the offence a person was arrested for the “next” time was the same as the previous one., Overall, it would appear that sex offenders are no more likely to “specialize” than are other offenders.  For example, starting with all of those who were arrested for sex offences, one can look at those arrested again and ask whether this next arrest was likely to be for a sex offence. The answer is that the probability of a person who was just arrested having his next offence be another sex offence was about 0.26. For those arrested for violent offences, if they were re-arrested again, the likelihood of their next arrest being a violent offence was 0.33.   “Specialization” for property offenders and public order (including drugs) offences was even higher (0.56 and 0.61, respectively)., Perhaps the most interesting finding is that “perfect specialization is rarely observed across all arrest cycles” (p. 216). Only about 5% of sex offenders could be described as ‘specialists’ (i.e., had only sex offences in their histories). Given that the group of offenders in this study tended to have substantial criminal records, it is not surprising that their re-offending rates tended to be quite high. When one looks at the proportion who never committed the same offence again, however, one finds that “the concentration of one-timers who did not repeated the same offence in any other cycle was substantially higher among sex offenders than any other offence type” (p. 216).  Using a more restrictive typology of offences, a similar pattern emerges. Two types of sex offenders (rapists and those arrested for child molestation) were compared to those arrested for other specific offences (e.g., robbery, burglary, aggravated assault).  About 74% of rapists and about 70% of those arrested for child molestation were ‘one timers’ compared to only 57% of robbers, 44% of those arrested for burglary, and 54% of those arrested for aggravated assault., Conclusion: “As a group and across different measures, sex offenders… are not typically specialists or persistent offenders…. In fact…specialization among sex offenders drops substantially over successive stages of their criminal careers” (p. 222).  Obviously, this study depends on ‘official’ data of offending and hence misses many offences.  There is no reason, however, to expect that this problem is specific to sex offenders.  The data suggest that the argument for special sexual predator laws (e.g., registries, etc.) may be based on false assumptions. “Given the major finding that the average sex offender… does not appear to be a persistent specialist over his arrest career, it seems somewhat unlikely that registration and notification policies will decrease sexual victimization” (p. 225)., Reference:  Miethe, Terance D., Jodi Olson, and Ojmarrh Mitchell.

"Though not all police crackdowns on gun violence are effective, some seem to be able to suppress gun violence, at least temporarily.","“Project Safe Neighbourhoods” brought over a billion dollars to cities in the United States to reduce crime, especially  gun violence. The political debate about guns in the U.S. has focused largely on attempts to restrict access to guns by “high risk” individuals (e.g., youths or those with criminal records).  More recently, however, “targeted enforcement” strategies have been used to try to reduce gun violence.  It appears that such strategies  are sometimes effective, but often are not., It would seem that there are a few general principles that apply in this area: (a) efforts to reduce gun misuse are likely to be more cost effective than broad efforts to reduce availability, and (b) “for a given level of law enforcement spending, we may achieve a greater deterrent effect by increasing the certainty rather than the severity of punishment” (p. 680; See also Criminological Highlights, 6(2)#1). This paper, therefore, suggests that “enforcement activities could be made more effective by prioritizing… targeted police patrols that seek to deter high risk people from carrying guns illegally” (p. 681)., A number of strategies that were part of Project Safe Neighbourhoods almost certainly were ineffective or have large costs relative to their value.  These include providing gun locks (to prevent thefts), school prevention programs, better controls on gun purchases, and better tracing of guns involved in crime. Two programs that are sometimes seen as being effective – those in Richmond, Virginia and in Boston (see Criminological Highlights, 7(5)#2) – are shown to be largely ineffective: “Homicide rates in Richmond were trending downward even before the launch of Project Exile” (p. 693-4) just as the decreases in Boston were no larger than decreases in other parts of the state.  Simply put, the flaw in simple claims of success with respect to many American “violence prevention” programs in the 1990s is that the programs were started during a period of broad decline in violence rates in many American cities. Said differently, crime rates went up in the latter part of the 1980s and then began declining before programs such as those in Richmond and Boston were implemented.  Those cities that showed the largest increases in the 1980s showed the largest decreases in the 1990s.  The gun homicide rate in Boston, for example, had decreased by about half  prior to the beginning of the program. It then continued to decrease for about three more years., One potentially promising strategy that appears to have been evaluated carefully was used in Pittsburgh. In response to concerns about guns being illegally carried in public places, concentrations of police on the street were increased dramatically (20%-50%) in high risk areas, during high crime periods (specified days and times). The police officers involved in this show of force did not have to respond to normal calls for service. Their focus, instead, was on traffic stops and “stop-and-talk” activities with pedestrians who appeared to have a high “risk” for carrying guns. The analysis involved comparisons of intensively policed areas with control areas, pre- and post-implementation during the targeted times and the “regular patrol density” times., Using “assault related gunshot injuries” and reports of “shots fired” as the measures of success, there appeared to be larger decreases in the densely-patrolled areas during the times when there were many police present.  Furthermore, perhaps because of intensive officer training, focused activities, and community involvement, the decrease in gun violence was apparently accomplished without aggravating community-police relationships. The concern, obviously, is that if targeted patrols of this sort were employed in a city, they could be seen giving the police a license to target certain racial (or other) groups., Conclusion.  It would appear that targeted increases in police patrols can suppress gun violence at least during the time that the police are present, and that with proper procedures, it is possible to do this without creating strained relationships between the police and the community.   To the extent that the focus can be narrow (i.e., on people and locations likely to have a high rate of carrying illegal guns), and to the extent that there is “extensive officer training and… [involvement of the] community in project design and implementation”  (p. 682) the overall impact can be positive. Nevertheless, it would appear that the effectiveness of such strategies is likely to be limited to those times and locations in which the concentration of police is high., Reference: Ludwig, Jens (2005).  Better Gun Enforcement, Less Crime.

Systematic analyses of police information about street gangs can be used to break up gangs.,", Though it is often difficult to know how to define a gang or to determine whether a particular individual should be considered to be a gang member (see Criminological Highlights, 4(1)#8), there is no doubt that in many cities street gangs are a social problem., One of the more popular police approaches to gangs that is often cited, without convincing evidence, as having been effective in reducing homicide rates, is Boston’s Operation Ceasefire (see Criminological Highlights, 7(5)#2 and #1, this issue). Its focus on collective accountability of group members  assumes that gangs have a known hierarchy, are cohesively organized, and are capable of controlling themselves or their members. In practice, this may not always be so.  A cohesive or “tight” gang structure might be disrupted by removing key individuals.  On the other hand, one researcher warns that “treating chaotic groups as cohesive groups may… create a self-determining prophecy. In fact, a law enforcement focus on gangs, through arrest, patrol, surveillance and other mechanisms, can be a powerful external source of cohesion” (p. 610)., This paper suggests that police should make use of network analysis  -- a focus on the “dynamic interaction among people or groups rather than on the attributes of such individuals or groups” (p. 611).  The importance of knowing the gang structure can be illustrated by a simple comparison.  If a gang is organized hierarchically, such that orders and control come from above, then those at the top of the structure might well be the appropriate people for the police to focus their efforts on.  On the other hand, consider an organization that is not hierarchical, but rather has a few key members who serve, informally, as communication links among non-hierarchically organized members. Searching for “leaders” may accomplish little compared to focusing on individuals who serve this “central” role., In this study, police in Newark, New Jersey were able, collectively, to gather information from “interviews” with members of street gangs. Putting together the information that was available about the links between individual gang members made it clear that, in Newark, gangs were not tightly organized. However, an analysis of gang structure revealed that there were certain individuals who served as the connection points between other individuals or groups of individuals.  In other words, if these “connecting” individuals were to disappear, there would be no linkages among various sub-groups or individuals.  For example, in one gang, one individual served as the only connection between two large groups of gang members.  These subgroups, themselves may have internal cohesion, but the “gang” as a whole did not.  In other words, by using information gathered by police, it was possible to understand the importance of specific individuals to the overall structure of the gang.  Descriptions of the “general characteristics” of a gang (e.g., hierarchically structured vs. loosely organized) does not reveal important characteristics of the networks that exist among gang members. By systematically analyzing “knowledge about particular individuals and their known associates, one has the capacity to gather some interesting and powerful information…. Social patterns in relationships can be easily missed or overlooked” (p. 623)., Conclusion. Police intervention with gangs can be effective, but it also can have paradoxical effects. It would appear that the gangs in this one city were not structured such that a collective-responsibility based approach by police could possibly reduce gang activity. Indeed, such a police strategy might have created a more cohesive and organized gang structure (p. 624). Focusing attention, on the other hand, on individual gang members who occupy key locations within the social structure may be effective in destroying the gang structure.  Obviously, “the utility of this analytic technique for interventions is, at this stage, hypothetical” (p. 628). Nevertheless interventions based on an empirically based “network analysis” would appear to have a higher likelihood of success than interventions based on hypothetical gang structures that may not exist., Reference: McGloin, Jean Marie (2005) Policy and Intervention Considerations of a Network Analysis of Street Gangs.  Criminology and Public Policy, 4 (3), 607-636., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV7N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-7-no-6-%E2%80%93-february-2006,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 7, No. 6 – February 2006",Regular Issue,2006
Police misconduct in highly disadvantaged neighbourhoods can lead to increases in violent crime.,", “Conflict between the police and public in structurally disadvantaged neighbourhoods may undermine police legitimacy … If members of disadvantaged communities perceive mistreatment and marginalization by the police, then they may rely on informal methods to redress conflict rather than seek police assistance.  Such a response to compromised police legitimacy may lead to increases in violence… as some residents cease their cooperation with formal legal authorities” (p. 470)., In this study, data from 74 local police precincts in New York City for the 22 year period from 1975 through 1996 were examined.  An index of structural disadvantage was created by combining data on the proportion of female headed households with children, the percent of black residents, the proportion of households receiving public assistance, the unemployment rate, and the proportion of residents with low educational achievement.  Police misconduct was operationalized as the number of officers compulsorily separated from the department due to misconduct including the number of officers allowed to resign under “questionable circumstances” (e.g., while under suspension or after having been charged).  The dependent measure was the violent crime rate., The results are quite straightforward.  Precincts were divided into low, high, and extreme (structural) disadvantage.  Within high and extreme disadvantage precincts, the level of police misconduct predicted the violent crime rate. The effect of police misconduct was higher in the extremely disadvantaged communities. There was no impact of police misconduct on violent crime rates in precincts characterized by low structural disadvantage., Conclusion.  The results of this study suggest that police misconduct can lead to increases in crime in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods.  The findings are consistent with the view that formal institutions, as well as informal institutions, can be important determinants of the crime rate in certain neighbourhoods. “In [the poorest] communities, residents may feel the most marginalized and socially dislocated and they may respond the most adversely to (real or apparent) violations of procedural justice norms by the police, who represent the most visible agents of official social control” …   These findings suggest the importance of police departments meeting procedural justice expectations, specifically in extremely disadvantaged communities” (p. 492)., Reference: Kane, Robert J.

Harsh sentences don’t deter crime in part because there is no relationship between the sentences that are handed down and people’s knowledge of those sentences.,", “The deterrence doctrine asserts that some people will refrain from some acts because they perceive a risk of punishment” (p. 623).  Deterrence-based policies assume that there will be some link between actual punishment and perceptions of punishment. When politicians raise penalties, they assume that people will know about the changes and will act accordingly.  The levels of certainty, severity, and swiftness of punishment can only affect behaviour if they are known., This study took place in 54 of the largest counties in the United States. Two sets of measures were collected: criminal justice processing measures, and estimates from members of the general public of these same measures. Data for four offence types were examined: robbery, homicide, aggravated assault, and burglary. For each of the four offence types, “actual punishment” measures in the respondent’s county were obtained on certainty (arrest per 100 offences known to the police and adults convicted per 100 adults arrested), severity (adults sentenced to prison per 100 adults convicted, average maximum sentence imposed), and swiftness of punishment (average days between arrest and sentencing).  Survey respondents in each county were asked to estimate each of these. A number of “control variables” were also measured including the actual crime rate in the county, victimization experience, TV news viewing, the respondent’s view of the importance of the crime problem, as well as various demographic characteristics., In general, respondents to the survey underestimated the proportion of offenders who received prison sentences, but were reasonably accurate on the length of the average sentence.  However, the averages tell us nothing about whether individuals living in more punitive locations also perceive their locations to be more punitive. There were no consistent findings that could support deterrence notions.  There were four offences, and five measures of punishment, leading to 20 tests of the deterrence notion. Two were significant and positive (supporting deterrence) – one on certainty and one on swiftness (none on severity). One relationship was in the opposite direction from that predicted by deterrence theory (on severity of punishment).   Since these findings exclude the 15-20% of respondents who were not willing to venture a guess about punishment levels in their area, it would appear that the authors, if anything,  biased the findings “in favour of finding a high correspondence between reality and perception, yet [they] still found virtually no association” (p. 651)., Conclusion.  In general, it would appear that these findings, derived from a sophisticated survey covering 54 different counties across the United States, support previous findings showing that people are largely ignorant of punishment levels in their communities.  Not surprisingly, then, changes in actual penalties being handed down are not accompanied either by changes in the proportion of citizens who think that sentences are too lenient or by changes in offending rates.  The deterrent effect sentences may have, then, is largely independent of actual severity of these sentences (See also, Criminological Highlights, 6(2)#1). Said differently, people cannot be deterred by severe sentences if they don’t know about them.  “These findings suggest that conventional efforts to increase general deterrent effects beyond their current level are so unpromising that policy makers should consider more productive alternatives beyond merely increasing punishment levels” (p. 655). Indeed, on the basis of these findings, decreases in punishment levels would be just as effective as increases in deterring people from offending., Reference: Kleck, Gary, Brion Sever, Spencer Li, and Mac Gertz.

Reporting an incident of domestic assault to the police reduces the likelihood that the victim will again be assaulted.,", The effect of various police actions on domestic violence has been a focus of research for the past 20 years. Although initial studies suggested that the arrest of offenders deterred future assaults, later more methodologically sophisticated studies suggested that this conclusion was over-stated. Some studies show no effect of arrest on offending; others show different effects for different subgroups of the population. From a policy perspective, of course, the concern is not only that calling the police, or arresting the offender, might not lead to favourable outcomes, it is also that such actions could conceivably lead to retaliation by the offender., This paper took advantage of the fact that the National Crime Victimization Survey in the United States interviews people six times during a 3-year period. People who reported being victims of a domestic assault in the beginning of this three year period were the focus of the study. They can be seen as being a representative sample of domestic violence victims during the 1990s. Victims were asked if the police were informed of the assault (by the victim or by someone else) and if the offender had been arrested.  Subsequent waves of the survey, then, were used to determine if the offender re-victimized the domestic assault victim as a function of whether the initial victimization was reported to the police (and if the offender was arrested).   Various “control” factors were included (e.g., the use of a weapon, whether the victim was injured, drinking/drug use, age, race, education of the victim, whether the victim was living in poverty)., The likelihood of a repeat victimization was dramatically higher for those victims who indicated that the incident did not come to the attention of the police.  In other words, there was an important protective effect of making the police aware that the victim had been assaulted.  Victims were divided into two groups: those who reported that the offender had committed similar offences prior to the incident that was recorded in the first victimization survey and those who reported that this was a first offence.  In those cases in which the victim reported on the victimization survey that it was the first offence, the probability of re-offending was about 10% for incidents that were not was not reported to the police, but only 5% for incidents that had been reported to the police., The re-offending rate was, not surprisingly, considerably higher for those offenders with a prior history of offending. Once again, however, the re-offending rate was considerably higher (35%) in those cases that were not reported to the police than in those cases that were reported (22%).   There was no statistically significant effect, however, of arrest. In other words, the evidence appears to suggest that it is the mere fact that the police find out about the assault that is important in deterring the offender.  Furthermore, for those cases that were reported to the police, it did not matter whether the victim or someone else reported them to the police. There was, therefore, no evidence that offenders would be particularly likely to retaliate against victims who, themselves, reported the assault to the police., Conclusion. It would appear that bringing a domestic assault to the attention of the police can have protective effects for the victim.  Moreover, “the effects of reporting and arrest on re-offending are similar for serious and less serious offenders” (p. 579).  Furthermore, the effect of reporting to the police appears to be the same for couples of various socioeconomic backgrounds.  Similarly, the lack of an effect on re-offending of the police decision concerning the arrest of the offender does not depend on the socioeconomic or marital status of the couple.  “It may be that a visit from the police changes the offenders’ attitudes toward their behaviour.  Offenders may redefine their behaviour as a criminal act. It may also change their perception of the costs of further violence” (p. 581-2).  Clearly, however, encouraging the reporting of domestic assaults to the police can reduce re-victimization., Reference: Felson, Richard B., Jeffrey M. Ackerman, and Catherine Gallagher (2005).  Police Intervention and the Repeat of Domestic Assault.  Criminology, 43 (3), 563-588., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV7N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-7-no-6-%E2%80%93-february-2006,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 7, No. 6 – February 2006",Regular Issue,2006
Girls are not getting more violent.,", There appears to be a belief – among some academics and in the popular press – that girls are becoming more violent than they were at some unspecified point in the past.  To a large extent, this belief is based on reports of high profile violent offences involving girls.  The “scientific” evidence of an apparent increase in violence by girls comes from data suggesting that youth court cases involving girls now constitute a higher proportion of the cases coming to court than they did 10-15 years ago in the United States (and in Canada)., The data on violence show important gender differences.  The “gender gap” (the difference in the rates for boys and girls) is larger for the more serious forms violence than it is for minor instances of  violence. Hence a policy that increases the number of “low end” cases being recorded is almost certainly going to lead to a larger proportional increases in total violence for girls than for boys. In addition, if, in the past, girls – more than boys –  tended to be screened out of the youth justice system if they were apprehended for minor instances of violence, then a “gender neutral” screening process would naturally lead to an apparent increase in “girl crime.”, This study looks at three types of data for the period 1980-2003: Police arrests of young people,  victimization reports in surveys, and adolescent self-reports of offending.  The findings suggest that a convergence of the rates of male and female youth violence (i.e., increasing similarity in the rates of violence for girls and boys) is only evident in the police data for overall violence and for assaults.  It is interesting to note that the convergence appears to be larger for simple assault than for aggravated assault.  There is no trend (i.e., no evidence of converging or diverging rates) in the police data for homicide or robbery. It is, therefore, assaults – offences for which there is likely to be more opportunity for police and others not to charge a youth – that are creating the apparent increased convergence of rates., What is notable about the curves derived from police recorded data on violence is that much of the recent convergence of the rates for girls and boys is due to relatively recent decreases in the rates for boys rather than increases in the rates for girls. In other words, girls’ rates tend to be fairly constant. Boys’ rates have, in recent years, decreased. Hence girls are described as being (relatively) more violent when the real cause of the change is boys: they are becoming relatively less violent. (There are similar findings from Canadian data.)  The trends for self-reported violence, however, show something quite different. There is “very little overall change both in girls’ assault levels and in the Violent Crime Index and, most notably, essentially no change in the gender gap or female-to-male percentage of violent offending.”  Said differently, girls are not getting more violent., Conclusion. The findings – that the only evidence of “convergence” of violence rates of girls and boys comes from police-recorded data –  suggest that the perception that girls are becoming more violent is a result of changes in the manner in which youths (girls, but equally importantly, boys) are being dealt with by the system.  The high visibility of police (and court) statistics and the low visibility of much of youth violence may partially explain the perception of increasing female youth violence. Furthermore, “there is no shortage of intuitively appealing speculations for explaining the apparent rise in girls’ violence…” (p. 390).  “Particularly important… is the media[’s]… eagerness to both create and spread conceptions of purported shifts in girls’ violence” (p. 391)., Reference: Steffensmeier, Darrell, Jennifer Schwartz, Hua Zhong, and Jeff Ackerman (2005) An Assessment of Recent Trends in Girls’ Violence Using Diverse Longitudinal Sources: Is the Gender Gap Closing?

Police crackdowns on bad driving can prevent serious traffic accidents.,", In 2001, Canada’s traffic accident death rate was 8.9 per hundred thousand residents – about five times the country’s homicide rate for that year. Various enforcement programs have been used to try to control bad driving.  Most of these programs have the goal of increasing the perceived risk of apprehension.  Although there have been thousands of local police programs designed to reduce the number of serious traffic accidents, only a tiny proportion of these have received adequate evaluations., This paper examines programs designed to crack down on problematic driving. Thirty-three high quality evaluations were found.  These involved studies of the effects of random breath testing or “sobriety check points” to reduce impaired driving (15 studies), the use of speed (5 studies) and red-light  cameras (4 studies), studies evaluating a combination of these two “camera” deterrents (4 studies), random “road watch” by police looking for traffic law violators (1 study), and mixed programs (4 studies) using one or more approach., The theory behind all of these programs is the same. Rather than focusing on what to do with law violators once they are caught, these programs attempt to affect the behaviour of those unapprehended individuals who might be sensitive to the threat of punishment. If completely effective, then, nobody would be apprehended and punished, but everyone would perceive a high likelihood of apprehension if they were to offend.  Given this underlying theory, it is not surprising that most programs –  23 of the 33 (70%) –  were implemented along with media campaigns.  There was, however, some variation on this dimension.  In 13 of 15 (87%) drinking-driving programs there were media campaigns, compared to only 7 of the 13 (54%) speeding or red-light camera programs, The results were overwhelmingly positive: 30 of the 33 programs showed reductions on such measures as fatal accidents or traffic accidents resulting in serious injuries.  The three studies that did not show a reduction had one thing in common: they were “automated” systems – red light or speed cameras.   It is possible that these “failures” reflect bad judgement concerning the locations in which the cameras were placed or the failure of the program to communicate the increased threat of apprehension that the cameras provided to law violators., In some cases there was evidence that the effect of the crackdown generalized to locations not covered by the program itself.  Though there was some variability in the size of the effect of these programs (e.g., the reduction in the percent of accidents with injuries ranged from 23% to 31%), there appeared to be more variability in the size of the effect for the “automated” red light or speed cameras., Conclusion.  It is clear that police practices that increase the perceived likelihood of apprehension for traffic violations can reduce the number of serious traffic accidents.  It appears that police crackdowns for impaired driving as well as crackdowns of speeding and running red lights can be equally effective., Reference: Blais, Etienne and Benoit Dupont (2005) Assessing the Capability of Intensive Police Programmes to Prevent Severe Road Accidents.

The “crime audit” – an attempt to evaluate how well local governments and police are doing in responding to crime – can have a negative impact on the manner in which a community responds to crime.,", In England, communities must conduct “crime audits” every three years. The audit process involves gathering information about crime from local agencies (e.g., police, probation, hospitals), analysis of this information (e.g., locating problem areas), and disseminating it to the community.  This paper suggests that audits should not be seen as being “neutral” descriptions or analyses of social problems., In the first place, crime audits begin with quantitative data that are readily available (e.g., police data) rather than any other information (e.g., citizen experiences of disorder) that are not so available. Moreover, they often focus on only a subset of crimes.  The purpose of the “crime audit” is, in part, to allow local governments to focus resources in effective ways. In addition the audit is supposed to help identify sources of information that are needed., One problem is that “What comes to matter [in a crime audit]… is the collection of measurable auditable data, rather than any particular concern with what is being measured” (p. 171). Furthermore, though masses of data may be gathered, the ability of any local government to use such data to guide policy (and ultimately to improve communities) is limited.  There is also a serious problem sometimes referred to as colonization which occurs when “organizational action comes to be guided by the values of the audit” rather than the values underlying the original problem., In a study of the impact of the audit process on a group of organizations involved in the treatment of alcohol and drug problems within marginalized communities, it was found that the nature of the data required for the audit was seen as “changing the nature of the agency and the workers’ understanding of their tasks” (p. 175).  The data requirements, for example, tended to conflict with the reality of working with drug users which is “often a ‘stepwise’ process [because] many of the clients… feel that they have previously been ‘failed’ by the state agencies” (p. 176).  As one worker put it, “If you ask too many questions too early the clients run off…. If we change too much in order to be able to supply information for the audit, then we’ll have to re-think what we’re about” (p 176).  Because of funding requirements, however, “most [workers] were resigned to making changes in order to fit into the audit process” (p. 177)., Conclusion.  The difficulty with audits is easy to describe. There is a “need of the  audit [process] to have working practices that are auditable [or easily quantifiable] in order that the data being fed into the audit ‘fit’ other types of data collected by a variety of agencies.”  Furthermore, “the need to be part of the audit process and to be included in local crime reduction partnerships has placed pressure on… agency managers to at least consider their priorities when thinking about work and what constitutes good practice” (p. 177). There is nothing wrong with changing priorities or practice.   What appears to be disturbing in cases such as these is not that agencies are changing what they are doing. It is that they are changing what they are doing in order to be “auditable” rather than in order to become more effective., Reference: Gilling, Daniel and Adrian Barton.  Dangers Lurking in the Deep: The Transformative Potential of the Crime Audit.  Criminal Justice, 5 (2), 163-180., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV7N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-7-no-6-%E2%80%93-february-2006,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 7, No. 6 – February 2006",Regular Issue,2006
"Grade 8 students from schools in which youths spend a lot of their time in unstructured, unsupervised activities have relatively high levels of delinquency.","Rates of delinquency vary dramatically across groups.  One way in which groups of youths differ is in the amount of time spent socializing without supervision or away from authority figures.  Previous studies have shown that the amount of time an individual spent in unstructured socializing was related to offending, drug and alcohol use, and dangerous driving., This study goes one step further and asks whether youths who go to schools in which large numbers of youths have amounts of substantial unstructured, unsupervised time are more likely to offend above and beyond any individual characteristics of the youths themselves.  This makes sense in part because if the social environment in which youths find themselves is largely unstructured and unsupervised, the youths will have more opportunities to commit offences., Over 4,000 Grade 8 students from 36 schools in 10 U.S. cities answered questions about a number of things including how much time they spent “hanging around with your current friends, not doing anything in particular, where no adults are present.”  They also reported their involvement in delinquent activities. Not surprisingly, the amount of time that the youth spent in unstructured, unsupervised activities was related to self-reported delinquency.  The time spent in unstructured activities was more important than other individual characteristics of the youth (sex, race, parents’ education).  More interesting, however, were the “school” effects: students attending schools in which youths generally spent lots of unstructured, unsupervised time were more likely to report high levels of delinquency above and beyond the youth’s own reports of time spent in unstructured activity.  Said differently, attending a school in which many youths spend a lot of time “hanging out” with their friends away from adults is likely to increase the level of delinquency above and beyond the time that the individual youths spend in unstructured activities. In effect, the results show that the local culture (in this case the youth’s school) has an impact on a youth independent of his or her own circumstances., Conclusion. Situations that are particularly conducive to delinquency are likely to occur when a youth engages in unstructured socializing away from authority figures.  Schools with many youths who spend time “hanging out” in unsupervised settings are, therefore, likely to increase opportunities for offending for all adolescents in that school, regardless of how much time they themselves spend in unsupervised activities.  The results would imply, therefore, that one way in which communities can minimize offending would be to provide attractive opportunities to youths that would encourage them  to spend more time in supervised activities.  If this were done within a community, the results of this study would suggest that there should be a reduction in the level of offending for all youths – those who spend a lot of time hanging out with their friends in unsupervised settings and those who do not., Reference:  Osgood, D.

Do the police engage in disproportionate stops of people of certain races?  The answer may depend on what is meant by ‘disproportionate.’,", ‘Racial profiling,’ or the disproportionate stopping (and/or searching) of people of non-dominant groups, is obviously a contentious issue in many countries including England, the United States, and Canada.  Simply put, there are two problems in assessing whether racial profiling is taking place. First, one has to measure or estimate the numerator – the number of people of various groups who are stopped and/or searched.  Second, one has to measure or estimate the denominator – the proportion of each group in the population., Each of these measurement tasks is problematic.  Getting valid data on the group membership of those stopped depends on having adequate police records, self-reports of citizens, or direct observations by third parties.  Denominator data are equally, if not more, problematic.  What population is one trying to estimate?  The problem is that the population of residents may not reflect the population of people who are available to be stopped.  Simply put, if the police are expected to stop people on the street in proportion to their membership in racial groups, one has to know the racial makeup of those on the streets not the racial makeup of the population as a whole., This study argues that “the use of the residential population as the comparative basis [for police “stop” statistics] is problematic, not least because different sections of the population may use public space differently” (p. 890).  In other words, the over-representation of any group (e.g., young males, blacks) may simply reflect the fact that the members of the group are more likely to be available in public places where the police stop citizens and therefore are at greater “risk” to be stopped.  In two cities in England (Reading and Slough) observers systematically counted the numbers of white, black, Asian, and ‘other’ people in public areas where the police were known to be likely to stop and search people on the street.  Thousands of people in each city were counted. These data were then compared to official records of stops and searches.  Compared to census data, blacks were more likely to be stopped and searched in both cities. In Slough, for example, blacks made up 6% of the population but were the subject of 15% of the stops.  However, blacks made up 17% of the available population (the population of those on the street).  The data for Reading were similar.  Blacks were not over-represented in stops when compared to the “available” population, but were when compared to the census figures. Asians in Slough were under-represented in stops. They made up 40% of the “available” population but were the subject of only 31% of the stops.   In addition, young men had a dramatically higher likelihood of being stopped and searched than their numbers on the street would have predicted., Conclusion.  The study demonstrates the importance of considering in a more sophisticated manner what the “expected” rate of stops would be for various groups if “profiling” did not exist.  In this study, resident population figures for two cities would suggest racial profiling was taking place, while available “street population” estimates would suggest that blacks in particular were not the subject of racial profiling.  The analysis suggests that one not only needs analyses of profiling that take into account the “available” population, but one also needs to consider why certain locations (as opposed to certain groups) are identified as appropriate for increased police proactive stops., Reference: Waddington, P.A.

Offensive language by police officers is at least as important as their behaviour in determining the way they are seen by ordinary citizens.,", What are the important dimensions of misconduct by the police from the perspective of ordinary citizens?  Traditionally, police misconduct in relation to interactions with citizens has been categorized as involving three dimensions: the use of unnecessary force (e.g., hitting or beating a citizen), abuse of authority (e.g., threats or the refusal of the officer to give his/her badge number/name), and discourtesy or the use of inappropriate language (e.g., racial slurs, insulting language).   This paper examines the relative importance of these dimensions in determining how police are seen by ordinary members of the public., Eleven hundred New York City residents were each read a set of short vignettes describing an interaction between a police officer and a citizen.  The officer’s language was described in neutral terms or in a range of different discourteous or obscene terms such as by calling the citizen a “fuckin’ piece of trash” (p. 686) or using a racial slur.  Abuse of authority was manipulated by simply stating that the officer threatened to arrest the citizen or engaged in a range of different forms of abuse such as “threatening to grab or kick the civilian”, or “refusing to provide a name or badge number” (p. 686). The use of unnecessary force was injected into some scenarios by saying such things as the officer “punched the civilian” or “drew his or her gun and aimed it at the civilian” (p. 687). The event precipitating the citizen-police interaction was also described in various ways. Some were ambiguous (e.g., the police officer was described as simply stopping the car and asking the citizen for his or her driver’s licence, etc.) while in other cases the citizen was described as having been observed committing an offence., One might have expected that the rated seriousness of the misconduct would increase incrementally as one moved along a continuum from offensive language through abuse of authority to the use of unnecessary force.  This was not the case. Independent of the reason for the encounter, the description of the civilian’s response to the officer and various other factors, “a police officer’s discourtesy or offensive language remained highly salient as an explanation of the respondent’s evaluation of the seriousness of misconduct” (p. 691). Language, it seems, matters and it matters a lot.  In particular, “unnecessary force in the presence of offensive language has a greater impact on… ratings” (p.692) than did abuse of authority (though abuse of authority did add significantly to the rated seriousness of the misbehaviour)., Conclusion: Offensive language “may be part of everyday speech [but] it carries a very different meaning when voiced by police officers” (p. 702) in an encounter with a citizen.  Along with abuse of authority and use of unnecessary force, language turns out to be very important in shaping citizens’ views of the police. At the same time, however, non-cooperative behaviour on the part of the citizen does lessen, somewhat, the rated seriousness of police misbehaviour.  The mitigating impact, however, is small compared to effects of police misbehaviour. Though the public may, under some circumstances, tolerate police misconduct, “the public’s tolerance for [police] misconduct in an encounter with a civilian does not extend to unnecessary use of force” (p. 703)., Reference: Seron, Carrroll, Joseph Pereira, and Jean Kovath.

The Crime Reduction Program (1999-2002) in England & Wales was a failure because of the manner and speed with which it was implemented and because it did not reflect what was known about crime reduction.,", In 1999, an ambitious crime reduction program was implemented in England and Wales. Substantial resources were allocated to evaluations so that the best programs could be chosen for implementation across the country.  Building on an optimistic review of what was known about crime reduction, the Crime Reduction Program (CRP) seemed to offer something to everyone, encouraging “the notion of building up a store of ‘scientific’ knowledge about ‘what works’ which could be translated into reliable advice on ‘best practice’, [and] disseminated to practitioners in user-friendly form” (p. 216)., Government funding structures, however, demanded rapid identification and implementation of crime reduction programs and of the evaluations before adequate planning and staffing could take place. The initial plan for a ten-year lifespan of the program was in conflict with the electoral cycle of government which needed early successes. What started as a series of experiments on crime reduction quickly morphed into programs with explicit crime reduction targets (a 25-30% reduction in five years) that were based on political wishes rather than empirical assessments of what was possible. Local communities were asked to design their own programs rather than to build or implement programs based on known best practices. Staffing these programs was difficult within the governmental requirement to spend money before the end of each fiscal year. Staff turnover was high since stability of employment could not be guaranteed. Programs were overly ambitious in terms of the nature of the promised interventions (since, among other things, programs were funded on a competitive basis).  The result was that few programs were fully implemented in a constructive manner. Given the nature of the funding, community organizations tended to treat them “as a ‘windfall’ to contribute to pre-existing plans….” (p. 223).  As time went on, there was more pressure to deliver “tangible crime reductions, at the expense of longer term pay-offs in terms of research knowledge” (p. 224).  This favoured the targeting of high volume, less serious crime and simplistic hardware-oriented approaches (e.g., CCTV), since implementation and larger reductions appeared more plausible in these domains., Evaluators, who were sometimes aware of the problems of design and implementation, were forbidden to pass their knowledge on to the program implementers. The result was that many of the evaluations carefully documented the implementation failure of the program in rich detail but could not determine if there had been an effect on crime., Conclusion. By creating impossible crime reduction targets, the crime reduction program was not seen as delivering the politically necessary results when crime (across the country) began to rise. The result was that “politicians were quick to lose patience with the program as initially conceived” (p. 231) and brought it to a close after three rather than ten years.  The problems faced by the program appear to have been “tied up with broader tensions and contradictions inherent in the differences in cultures, perceptions and time-frames of policy makers and politicians, practitioners and academics, including differences in their understandings of the nature, purposes and reliability of ‘research’ itself” (p. 232)., Reference: Maguire, Mike (2004).  The Crime Reduction Programme in England and Wales.

Prison doesn’t work (again).,", In 1993, Michael Howard, then Home Secretary and subsequently head of Britain’s Conservative Party, suggested that “prison works,” contradicting the same government’s 1990 statement that “prison was an expensive way of making bad people worse” (p. 390).  His statement was, of course, consistent with those of many others at the time (e.g., James Q. Wilson), but he also cited British research saying that, for prisoners, “avoidance of imprisonment was the most frequently mentioned reason for not wanting to reoffend” (p. 392).  That research – whose purpose was to investigate “the contradiction between such allegedly rational calculus and subsequent… offending” – also showed that 62% of prisoners reported that they had reoffended in the two years following release.  Nevertheless, the authors of the cited research suggest that “the stated desires, intentions and beliefs of offenders cannot be meaningless and are probably related to how people act” (p. 393)., Shortly before this group of 130 men was about to be released in the early 1990s, “over 80% reported that they wanted to go straight but only 25% thought they would definitely be able to go straight” (p. 395). The predictions that about-to-be-released prisoners made of their likelihood of reoffending were fairly accurate.  Those who thought they would go straight and felt confident that they had the ability to do so were less likely to reoffend within two years than were those who were pessimistic about their ability to go straight. This same group of offenders was examined (through official records) ten years after release. Over 80% had committed at least one subsequent crime. However, those who were hopeful of their ability to go straight were much less likely to have been re-imprisoned than were those who were less optimistic about their future., However, “hope for the future” appears to be relevant only for those people not exposed to too many social problems: “When faced with a large number of exogenous social difficulties… a person’s attitudes and internal motivation may be overwhelmed by reality” (p. 399)., Conclusion.  It would appear that simple rational choice theory, as applied to offending, once again is found to be inadequate.  These findings suggest that “one important individual factor to consider… is the role of hope among prisoners.  A rational choice to avoid imprisonment, verbalised in moments of reflection or in interviews with researchers, is not on its own going to make much difference if the person does not believe they have the ability or the resources to make this change.  One needs both the ‘will and the ways’ for this rational choice to be meaningful…  The notion that… ‘decent but austere’ prisons can both scare inhabitants straight through sheer deterrence, and also somehow become hotbeds for hope and developing self-efficacy seems a far fetched fantasy…. The subsequent criminal careers of the majority of the sample contradict the easy assumption that a distaste for imprisonment, itself, leads to a lifestyle that avoids repeating the experience” (p. 401)., Reference:  Burnett, Ros and Shadd Maruna.  (2004) So ‘Prison Works’, Does it?  The Criminal Careers of 130 Men Released from Prison under Home Secretary, Michael Howard.  The Howard Journal, 43, 390-404., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV7N2.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-7-no-2-%E2%80%93-march-2005,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 7, No. 2 – March 2005",Regular Issue,2005
Laws allowing the government to confiscate the proceeds of crime did not work in the Netherlands.,", One of the more popular legal approaches to combating organized crime and terrorism is to require the reporting to government of suspicious transactions and to allow governments to freeze and confiscate assets believed to be associated with crime.  Depriving criminals of their illicit earnings is seen as hitting them “at their most vulnerable spot: their assets” (p. 517).  The theory seems to be that this will hurt the organization, whereas imprisonment of members of the criminal organization may hurt the individuals, but not the organization., In 1993, the Netherlands adopted legislation making it possible for prosecutors to seize assets if they could convince a court that involvement in criminal activity had increased an offender’s revenue.  Financial investigations were enabled by allowing prosecutors to identify funds obtained by illegal advantage up to two years after conviction. The range of assets that could be seized was increased, and, in addition, procedures for out-of-court deals were created., The Netherlands Ministry of Justice estimated that the government would gain €200 million (about C$320 million) in three years. This was seen by some as having the potential to encourage abuse of power by the police and prosecutor by putting enormous pressure on them to collect as much money as possible.  In fact, during a six-year period (1995-2001), a total of €129 million in confiscation orders were made, but only €27 million were actually collected. “These figures underline the fact that it is extremely difficult to ensure the execution of court orders [just as it has been in the U.K]… The public prosecution department has been very reluctant to take people into custody when they are unwilling to pay.  Thus the alleged big stick has become a minor twig” (p. 521)., Based on the assumption that people should not profit from crime, these laws developed without much knowledge of the details of the problem.  The laws seemed to be based on the theory that serious “organized” offenders “regard the threat and fact of imprisonment as the cost of doing crime” and are willing to pay this price, but are not willing to lose their profits.  There is no evidence that this is correct: “The assumption that by depriving one criminal of his proceeds, the financial situation of an organisation as a whole may be influenced is… not supported by any empirical research” (p. 525). For “ordinary” white collar criminals, it seems that “if necessary, this type of offender is willing to pay huge amounts of money in order to prevent themselves from being sent to prison” (p.525) suggesting that imprisonment is more of a worry than is the loss of money., Conclusion. The reasons for these disappointing results relate to both “weak policy theory” and “defective law enforcement” (p. 522).  The theory that organized crime is likely to be affected by legal threats to assets is not supported by the evidence.  Law enforcement agencies are unable or unwilling to spend resources attempting to “follow the money.” Indeed, when one looks at the cases that have contributed to the money that has been collected, “in 84% of the cases, the estimated amount of illegally obtained income does not exceed €45,000 [approximately C$72,000]” (p. 528). Almost half of the cases involve amounts under €4500. The law does not seem to be applied, primarily, to “organized crime” since the amounts often involved are quite small. Confiscation is a low priority for the police and prosecutors., Reference: Nelen, Hans (2004).

"One problem with civil commitment laws as an approach to incarcerating those thought to be sexually violent predators is that experts cannot agree, when assessing individual cases, who a dangerous sexual predator is.",", Sixteen U.S. states have laws that allow for the civil commitment after incarceration of those thought to be dangerous sexual predators.  The U.S. Supreme Court has required that the targets of such laws have (1) a history of criminal sexual behaviour,  (2) “a mental abnormality or personality disorder predisposing the individual to sexual violence, and (3) a likelihood of future sexually violent behaviour” (p. 357)., This study examined the most basic statistical requirement of such commitment laws: the likelihood that two “experts” would give the same assessments to a potential “Sexually Violent Predator.” The records of all 295 male convicted sex offenders in Florida who were assessed by at least two professionals under this provision during one year (1 July 2001-30 June 2002) were examined. A total of 25 different experts (licensed psychologists or psychiatrists) assessed at least one prisoner.  The focus of the study is simple: did the two professional assessors come to similar conclusions?  If they did not, the question of validity becomes irrelevant: Reliability of assessment is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for predictive validity., The results were not encouraging. Using an accepted standard for assessing the strength of the agreement between the two assessors, only the risk assessment instruments achieved good reliability.  The reliability of the risk measure is not surprising: high risk scores can be obtained on the basis of criminal history or demographic factors alone (factors that are reliably assessed and may predict reoffending in any prisoner but not necessarily sexual reoffending)., Most importantly, reliability was poor for most diagnostic categories.  Only “pedophilia” and “other mental illness” had fair reliability.  Collapsing the “mental illness” measures into one overall diagnostic measure “to see if evaluators can agree that an individual meets criteria for some paraphilia” (p. 363) resulted, again, in poor reliability.  Probably the most important single finding was that “the inter-rater reliability of the civil commitment recommendation proved to be poor.” Given that these laws typically require that the individual “suffer a mental disorder that predisposes the individual to future sexual violence” the unreliability of the diagnosis is a serious problem., Conclusion.  The fact that mental health professionals cannot agree on whether a prisoner has or does not have a mental disorder that predisposes him to commit a sexual offence suggests that civil commitment laws such as this one – whose purpose it is to incarcerate people for crimes they might commit – cannot fulfill their purpose.  Reliability of assessment or diagnosis must be achieved before it is worth even considering issues of the validity of the assessments.  Given the poor showing on the reliability measures, it is clear that the laws which civilly commit those thought to be sexually violent predators cannot achieve their stated function., Reference: Levenson, Jill S. (2004).  Reliability of Sexually Violent Predator Civil Commitment Criteria in Florida.  Law and Human Behaviour, 28, 357-367., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV7N2.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-7-no-2-%E2%80%93-march-2005,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 7, No. 2 – March 2005",Regular Issue,2005
Traditional measures of police performance – based on managerial or technical attempts to find an equivalent to the private sector’s “bottom line” – should be replaced.,", The development of performance measures for police is inherently a normative or political process. “One…  has to have a theory about whose views of the ‘good’ and the ‘right’ should count in setting a standard for policing” (p. 3).  Who does the valuing of the police?   Should the focus be largely on instrumental goals (e.g., reducing crime, increasing security) or on fair and impartial enforcement regardless of instrumental results?  
This paper suggests that the most appropriate perspective for thinking about police performance measures is that of citizens who “have to decide what kind of police department they would like not knowing whether they would end up being individuals who called the police for assistance, individuals who supported the police by paying taxes, or individuals who were arrested by the police” (p. 4). The goal of “satisfying customers” is not sufficient since identifying customers is complex.  The satisfaction of those who call the police is clearly important, but those same people are also taxpayers who may not feel it is appropriate to spend large amounts of public resources responding to minor calls for service.  Fair treatment may not be valued by a citizen until such time as that same citizen is the recipient of the treatment.  Hence the suggestion is made that the citizen who should be “considering a question about the just and fair use of state resources [is someone who is doing so] without knowing the particular position he or she occupies in society” (p. 7).   In this way, citizens are more like owners than customers and “are interested in the overall, aggregate performance of the department” (p. 8) not just the quality of the experience of individuals who call for service.  Hence the quality of the experience of all of those who come in contact with the police is important, in part because in the exercise of state authority, any citizen can be obligated by the police to do certain things., The factors that might be nominated for discussion in this context would then be wide ranging.  It would be for the “community” (as defined above) to decide on what weight these, and other, factors might be given:, The process of “developing an ordered sense of the values that would be worth pursing” (p. 14) by a publicly funded police department might include the following:, The paper suggests the following as a starting point:, Measures for each of these can be created.  Such a set of values, of course, puts pressure on police to “pay closer attention to the value…  [that is derived] from sustaining particular capabilities and specialized product lines” (p. 17).  Investments in new technology and programs would need to be capable of demonstrating improvements in highly valued areas., Conclusion.  The suggestion made here is that a combination of principled and instrumental values that can be measured need to be identified.  The perspective that needs to be taken is that of members of the community who do not know whether they are or will be simply taxpayers, citizens making requests of the police, or citizens subject to police powers.  Such an explicit set of values, associated with police policies and the allocation of resources, would allow the community to evaluate whether “the police have been fair in the ways they allocate their resources and impose the burdens of their investigations…. To see whether a police department is getting better…. one must first have conception of what is valuable, and then find a way to measure it” (p. 18)., Reference: Moore, Mark H. and Anthony A. Braga.

"Much of the opposition to having a prison in one’s community is related to concern about problems associated with visitors to the prisons, not inmates.","It is estimated that in about 80% of proposals for new prisons in the United States, there is community opposition (p. 145).  What is less well known, however, is exactly why people oppose having these institutions built in their neighbourhoods.  This study reports on a survey of residents in an area of Pennsylvania in which a new 550-bed facility was to be constructed for juveniles who were convicted and sentenced as adults.  Those surveyed included people in the immediate neighbourhood (within a 2 mile radius of the proposed prison site), those in the same borough/township, and those somewhat further away but in the same county., Only about 15% of those surveyed thought that crime would increase as a result of the placement of the prison in their community.   Those living very close to the proposed prison site were more likely than those living further away (but in the same county) to believe that crime would increase as a result of the new prison.  But the largest single predictor of concern about increased crime from the new prison was concern about visitors: those who thought that “people coming into the community to visit inmates would cause problems in the local community” (p. 152) were more likely to think that the new prison would be a cause of increased crime., Safety concerns were assessed through questions relating to concerns about inmate escapes, as well as safety of the respondent and the respondent’s family. People from wealthier households had fewer safety concerns related to the new facilities, with those in the immediate vicinity having the highest level of safety concerns.  Finally, the belief that visitors would cause problems was the strongest predictor of safety concerns., Conclusion: Not surprisingly, those living closest to the proposed site of the large youth custodial facility showed the highest level of concern about their own safety and increased crime.  The most intriguing finding, however, is that concerns about safety and crime seem to be most highly associated with concerns about problems created by visitors to the prison (e.g., family members).  It would appear that “fear of visitors and the impact they could have on the local community may be the driving force behind the opposition [to having a correctional facility in one’s neighbourhood]” (p. 161).  Clearly, if one were interested in addressing the concerns of those living in close proximity to a new correctional facility, addressing their concerns about visitors to that facility would be a good place to start., Reference: Martin, Randy and David L.

An intensive juvenile probation program providing many services to young offenders had no impact on recidivism.,", It is often assumed that “more” is better in providing services to youth in the community. In particular, since many of the youth who are involved with the (formal) youth justice system tend to have various identifiable social, educational, and psychological “needs,” the idea that efficient delivery of services would reduce future offending is very attractive. The evidence supporting this assumption is, at best, mixed. For example, one program that provided “at risk” but ordinary youths with comprehensive services showed long-term negative impacts (See Criminological Highlights, 5(4), #1)., This study, in California’s Ventura County, examined local youths (age 12-18) who were apprehended either for an offence or for a violation of probation and who were deemed to be of “moderate” risk to reoffend.  They were randomly assigned either to receive ordinary probation supervision or a form of “intensive” treatment program. The ordinary probation involved minimal intervention: a monthly contact with the youth, referrals to outside agencies, and no particular special services., The intensive program involved at least one hour of face-to-face contact with a probation officer per week, at least two family contacts a month, a focus on helping the family, including programs to address various “risk factors” within the family (e.g., alcohol and drug programs, anger management, parenting skills, etc.), as well as restorative programs with the victims and contact with community programs and activities.  It was estimated that the youths receiving “standard” treatment had an average of 6.2 minutes of contact per month with various service providers compared to 6 hours and 11 minutes of contact for the youths in the intensive program., Youths were followed for 18 months after the end of the intervention period. The proportion of youths in the two groups who apparently offended during the follow-up period was almost identical: 59% for the intensive probation group and 58% for the standard probation group came in contact with the police for a new offence.  Members of two groups were almost equally likely to be taken to court and to end up being incarcerated.  Not surprisingly, given their levels of contact with various service providers (and monitoring by these providers), the youths who received the high level of treatment were more likely to have been found to have used drugs. Although the intensive intervention program was designed for relatively high risk youths, and a high proportion of the youths in the program were apprehended for subsequent offences, it is possible that these were not high enough risk youths to benefit from the high intensity intervention (p.43)., Conclusion. It is often believed that a youth justice system without a full array of services that are delivered when they are deemed to be needed constitutes an unfulfilled promise of special treatment for youths.  This study, consistent with many others, suggests that although youths in the experimental program “received a more intense program in terms of amount and length of contacts and types of services given,” (p. 42) there were no differences in recidivism and few other differences between the experimental group and the randomly assigned control group which received “standard” probation programming.  Providing “services” does not guarantee that these services will be effective., Reference: Lane, Jodi, Susan Turner, Terry Fain, and Amber Sehgal (2005).

The private sector is no better than the public sector at running prisons that reduce recidivism.,", When private prisons first came on the scene, it was suggested that they would outperform publicly run prisons on many dimensions.  However, over the years, it has been shown that they are not less expensive (Criminological Highlights, 2(5)#2); they appear to have at least as many escapes and other disruptions (Criminological Highlights, 5(2)#1); and the operation of private prisons raises fundamental questions about their relationship to government (Criminological Highlights, 3(6)#1; 3(6)#2).  This paper examines the hypothesis that privately run prisons will be more effective than publicly run prisons at reducing recidivism.  This hypothesis is based on the assumption that private corporations will have a greater motivation than the public sector to show positive results., This study compares recidivism rates of privately and publicly run prisons in Florida.  Various comparisons relating to the amount and type of exposure to private prisons were used to take into account different theories concerning the impact of prisons on individuals. Rather than simply comparing recidivism rates of those released from public and private institutions, inmates were grouped in a number of different ways in order to make public-private comparisons. These included, for example, measures of the proportion of time spent in the two types of prisons, and comparisons involving inmates who had spent at least 6 months in one or the other type of prison. The records of inmates were examined for a 5-year period following release., An initial analysis shows, not surprisingly, that inmates (male adults, female adults, and young males) who served time in publicly run prisons (by various operationalizations of “serving time”) tended to be somewhat different from inmates who served time in “private” prisons on a number of dimensions known to relate to recidivism (e.g., offence, level of custody). These results suggest that simple comparisons of the impact of “public” and “private” prisons that do not control for inmate differences are likely to show effects that have nothing to do with the public/private comparison., The results – when pre-existing factors known to relate to recidivism are controlled for – are easy to describe.  For male adult offenders, female adult offenders, and for male young offenders (there were no young females placed in private facilities) there were no effects of the institution type (public vs. private) on recidivism (reoffending or reimprisonment)., Conclusion:  In this study of the impact of private prisons on recidivism, “Six separate comparisons of the levels and types of exposure to public and private prisons were quantified and analyzed for three inmate types…: adult males, adult females, and youthful male offenders.  In total, 36 distinct comparisons of recidivism rates between public and private prisons were analyzed, each controlling for numerous factors known to affect recidivism rates after prison release.  For adult males, adult females, and youthful male offenders, no statistically significant differences in recidivism rates were found between public and private inmate groups” (p. 78)., Reference: Bales, William D., Laura E.

"In recent years in the United States, Republican strength in state legislatures following closely contested state elections is a good predictor of increased prison admissions.",", The rate of imprisonment in the United States is at an all time high – approximately 5-9 times those rates in European Union countries and in Canada.  Most commentators suggest that crime first became a national election issue in the U.S. in 1964, and since then its prominence as an election issue has increased.  This paper examines the cynical hypothesis that the “tough on crime” approach in state election politics translates into higher rates of imprisonment not just when there is Republican strength in state legislatures, but in particular immediately following a closely contested (state) electoral race., This study examines the impact of state elections (from 1977 until 1996) on prison admissions, arguing that prison admissions constitute the measure most immediately sensitive to actions of state legislatures.  The measure of electoral competition was an index combining the closeness of the electoral races for legislative seats, the proportion of highly contested seats in the election, and the proportion of seats that were contested at all., The findings suggest that the impact of Republican strength in the legislature on prison admissions increased as the level of competition in the preceding election increased. In addition, it was found that for a given level of competition, the impact of Republican legislative strength on prison admissions increased over time. Over the 20 year period examined in this paper, the impact of a Republican dominated legislature on prison admissions was negligible in the 1970s, but strongly associated with increasing prison admissions in the 1990s.  More interesting, however, is the fact that the importance of Republican legislative strength (especially in recent years) increased when there was a close election., There were other predictors of the prison admission rates. For example, high welfare rates were negatively associated with prison admissions, supporting the conclusion that “penal and welfare institutions [in the U.S.] have come to form a single policy regime aimed at governance of social marginality” (p. 233).  Above and beyond the political effects, however, there was no impact of unemployment rate or of the racial makeup of the state on the overall rate of prison admissions., Conclusion. “When [electoral] district competition is low, increases in Republican strength in the legislature do not have much effect on prison admissions.  By contrast, when [electoral] district competition is high, increases in Republican legislative strength are accompanied by significant increases in prison admissions” (p. 232).  Law-and-order politics resulting in increased prison admissions appear to be most likely to be used in circumstances when right-of-centre politicians believe that they are under electoral threat., Reference: Stucky, Thomas D., Karen Heimer, and Joseph B.

"Contrary to what many youths believe when they join gangs, gang membership offers no protection from violent victimization.",", There is a fair amount of evidence that “being involved in a delinquent lifestyle increases the risk of personal victimization” (p. 794).  Clearly gang membership is associated with increased offending. It would appear that, in general, “gang members may exhibit extensive involvement in delinquency before joining a gang, increase their delinquency even more upon entering the gang, and then decrease their level of delinquency after exiting the gang” (p. 796).   It appears that gang membership is typically rather short lived: One study found that most gang members were in a gang for a year or less., This study examined not offending, but violent victimization among youth. Specifically it examined the impact of gang membership on victimization in two samples: a representative group of Grade 8 students and a group of 11-12 year olds who were followed for 5 years after their initial contact with the researchers., Youths who indicated that they were members of gangs were considerably more likely to report that they had been victims of both minor and more serious assaults as well as robbery. More interestingly, “consistent with prior findings regarding delinquent behaviour, [the] findings provide evidence of an enhancement effect of gang membership on victimization.  Rates of violent victimization are higher for gang members than for nongang members both before and after their gang membership” (p. 808). Generally victimization peaks when the youth is a member of a gang., Many youths indicated that one of the reasons they joined a gang was for protection. However, the “results indicate that it appears not to be the case that youths who join [gangs] for protection have higher victimization rates prior to gang joining than youths who do not join for this reason, nor are their victimization rates lower once in the gang compared to youths who join for other reasons” (p. 809)., Conclusion: Generally speaking, it would appear that the likelihood of a youth being a victim of violence is related both to violent offending by that youth and to gang membership. “Gangs do not provide protection for their members. In fact, youths who join gangs experience greater violent victimization while in their gangs than they do either before they join or after they leave” (p. 813)., Reference: Peterson, Dana, Terrance J.

A comprehensive study of crime in 188 U.S. cities demonstrates that three strikes laws did not lower crime rates.,", Between 1993 and 1996, 25 U.S. states plus the U.S. federal government passed some form of “three strikes” laws – laws in which a person convicted for the third time typically gets a dramatically longer sentence than they would have received if they had no criminal record.  In some states, the second conviction also results in a sentence harsher than the offence itself would warrant.  What counts as a “strike” varies across jurisdictions.  The proponents of this form of sentencing law suggest that through general deterrence and/or incapacitation, these laws will reduce crime., The application of “three strikes” laws, however, has been dramatically uneven.  “Strikes” in some locations are not brought to the attention of the court (perhaps as part of plea bargains) and, as a result, offenders often do not receive the enhanced sentence prescribed by the law.  Much of the research has focused on California where three strikes provisions were aggressively administered. But even in California the evidence does not support the hypothesis that these laws reduce crime (See Criminological Highlights, 1(3)#4, 2(6)#3, 5(2)#2, 6(2)#1). Furthermore, there is evidence that they create other problems (See Criminological Highlights, 1(2)#5, 3(3)#5) for the administration of justice., This study examines the impact of the state level sentencing laws on crime in 188 U.S. cities with populations of 100,000 or more. Crime rates for homicide, robbery, assault, rape, burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft were examined.  A long list of variables known to relate to local crime rates – e.g., percent of households headed by females, percent living below the poverty line, percent Black or Hispanic – were controlled statistically., In general, crime in these cities began decreasing before the passing of three strikes laws in 1994 or 1995.  But, before controlling for any other variables, it appeared that crime decreased “slightly faster” (p. 221) in three strikes states. However, when the various control factors are included in the analysis, there was no evidence of a decrease in crime rates attributable to the 3-strikes laws.  There was, however, some evidence that “states adopting three strikes laws were the same ones relying more heavily on incarceration as a crime control strategy during… the 1980s and 1990s” (p. 225).  Only one reliable effect was identified: homicide rates increased by about 10.4% after the passage of three strikes legislation. The passing of three strikes laws did not appear to be consistently related to other crime rates., Conclusion. When the data are examined on a state-by-state basis, one can find jurisdictions where crime reductions appeared to be associated with the passage of three strikes laws.  However, given that there are increases in the same crimes associated with the passage of similar laws in other states, it would appear to be most likely that the laws are not the cause of either the decrease in crime rate in some locations or the increases in others. “One cannot cherry-pick those states that appear to benefit from the passage of a three strikes law and ignore states where the laws appear to have a deleterious impact on crime” (p. 232)., Reference: Kovandzic, Thomislav V., John J.

"In a study of 5,272 domestic violence cases, it was found that the more serious the charge that was laid, the less likely it was that victims would support the prosecution of the person charged with the assault.",", Police and prosecutors, on the one hand, and victims of domestic violence, on the other, often have conflicting goals.  Victims may initially involve the police in domestic violence incidents in order to stop the violence that is occurring, but may not want the offender to be arrested   (See Criminological Highlights, 3(5)#6).  Victim cooperation with the prosecution appears, even in specialized domestic violence courts, to be an important determinant of whether a prosecution goes forward (See Criminological Highlights, 4(4)#8). In the past 25 years or so, mandatory charge and “no drop” policies have become quite popular with police and prosecutors.  At the same time, however, there are data (See Criminological Highlights, 3(2)#7) suggesting that women are quite good at predicting whether they are going to be re-victimized by their partners. Thus it is not surprising that there is increased pressure for criminal justice decision makers to take into account victims’ preferences when deciding whether to prosecute an accused., This study investigated the determinants of victim support for prosecution in domestic violence cases in Sacramento County, California, from 1 July 1999 until 31 December 2000. The prosecutors’ files on each case served as the source of information about the nature of the case and the victim’s support for prosecution.  Continuous support for the prosecution was defined as originally wanting a prosecution and not withdrawing support at any point during the criminal process.  In about 29% of the cases it was clear that the victim supported prosecution, and in an equal number of cases it was clear that the victim did not give continuous support. In 43% of the cases, the level of victim support could not be determined., Not surprisingly, those who suffered severe attacks or needed medical attention were more likely to give full support to the prosecution, as were those for whom there had been previous incidents of domestic violence.  Similarly, those victims who had previously received “protective orders” from the court were more likely to support the prosecution of the offender.  Victims, especially Black, Hispanic, or other minority races or ethnicities, who were cohabiting with the offender were, however, less likely to support prosecution.  The 12% of victims who were male were also less likely to support prosecution. Prosecutors in many of these domestic violence cases had some choice on how to proceed.  They could file the case as a felony, as a less serious misdemeanour, or in some cases as a violation of probation.   When other factors (e.g., the seriousness of the offence) were statistically controlled, victim support for prosecution was lower when the accused was charged with a felony.  In this jurisdiction, a felony conviction would likely result in an average sentence of 240 days as compared to 30 days for a misdemeanour or a probation violation.  It is possible that potentially harsher sentences for the offender were seen by victims as having excessive “costs” for the victim as well., Conclusion: Offence characteristics (e.g., whether there was injury), victim characteristics (e.g., race/ethnicity) as well as relationship characteristics (e.g., that the offender and victim were cohabiting) were important determinants of support for prosecution.  However, one variable – the severity of the charge that was laid – had an impact on support for the prosecution above and beyond these other factors.  It would appear that a strong initial response (in the form of a more serious charge) from the criminal justice system may not necessarily bring support for a prosecution in domestic violence cases., Reference: Kingsnorth, Rodney F. and Randall C.

"The likelihood that a youth will be chosen to participate in a restorative justice program varies with the type of community the youth comes from, the offence that was committed, and characteristics of the youth.",", Restorative justice programs for youths who offend are increasingly popular in many parts of the world.  However, because communities are almost invariably involved in the implementation of restorative justice programs, the nature of the community in which a youth resides is likely to be seen as being important in determining whether a young offender will be given an opportunity to participate in a restorative process. “Restorative justice assumes a community responsible for criminal activity, while addressing the harm caused by the offender.  However, community aspects can facilitate or hinder offenders’ reintegration process” (p. 106, emphasis in original)., In this study, youths who were eligible for diversion from an Arizona youth court were identified and followed through the justice process. One group of youths was referred to a restorative justice program in which decisions about what would happen to them were made using a family group conferencing model. Resolutions typically involved some combination of restitution, community service, fine, counselling, etc. A second group of youths was diverted from the court using “standard diversion mechanisms” (p.111). The decision on whether the youth was offered the restorative program or the standard program was made by probation staff and the prosecutor’s office. Generally, diversion from full prosecution was offered to first or second time offenders except those charged with sex offences or serious violent offences. Characteristics of the youth as well as characteristics of the youth’s community were examined.  In considering the selection process, it is important to keep in mind that the choice for these youths was either a restorative justice program or informal supervision by court personnel., Youths selected for the restorative justice program tended to be much more likely to have been apprehended for a property offence, and much less likely to have been apprehended for a status offence than youths who were diverted from the court in the ordinary manner.  The restorative justice youths were slightly more likely to be in school and were more likely to be white.  Youths from communities with high unemployment rates were more likely to be chosen for the restorative justice program, perhaps because they are seen as most in need of the reintegration process (p. 120).  Youths from communities with a high level of Spanish speaking households and from racially/ethnically heterogeneous neighbourhoods were less likely to be chosen for the restorative justice program., Youths were followed for 24 months after they had successfully completed their program requirements. There was some indication that youths sent to the restorative program were less likely to reoffend than were youths who were sent through the standard program, though it was not clear whether this difference could be attributable to the different treatment that the two groups received or some other difference between the groups., Conclusion: In this particular program, it would appear that justice officials take into account both individual and community factors in deciding who is “appropriate” for restorative justice programs.  Even within a group of youths who were all being diverted from the formal court system, characteristics of the offender, offence, and the community made a difference.  Access to restorative programs, even when they are available, then, depends to some extent on who you are and where you live., Reference: Rodriguez, Nancy (2005).

"To determine whether a youth justice system is effective, one first has to define what its primary purpose might be.  “Many of the conflicts and tensions, both within the juvenile justice system and in public debate, arise because we want the system to do many different things that may be incompatible, or at least hard to reconcile” (p. 184).","Young people are seen as being responsible for their actions, including their criminal behaviour. At the same time they are seen as objects to be controlled by adults in a manner that would not be permissible if they were fully mature.  A youth justice system can be seen as an attempt to reconcile these opposing principles., The “effectiveness” of a youth justice system can be defined in a number of different ways including the following:Responding in a morally and legally appropriate manner to offending. “The emphasis is on retribution out of a sense of justice” (p. 183)., One reason to be hesitant in defining “effectiveness” solely in terms of rehabilitating young offenders is that the effects of better rehabilitative programs tend to be modest – with many showing effects “equivalent to a reduction in re-offending rates of about 5%, for example from 50% to 45%.”  The programs that tend to show larger effects “are those that directly address behaviour problems, by using a social learning approach, teaching social and interpersonal skills and helping young people to perceive and think about their own and other people’s behaviour in a different way…. [a cognitive behavioural approach]” (p. 188).  More generally, the evidence does not support the notion that intervention per se by the youth justice system will reduce subsequent offending., Conclusion. “Progressives and reformers often base their analysis [of the youth justice system] on the idea that the only function of the system is changing the future behaviour of young offenders, and deliberately repress or overlook the pressures for condemnation, retribution and victim satisfaction.  This is a mistaken strategy on many levels.  These demands will always reassert themselves.  Success in changing behaviour patterns will never be striking, but the more that the intervention is justified in terms of crime reduction consequences, the greater the pressure to expand the scope of the system.  Attempts to meet offenders’ needs, to rehabilitate, to reintegrate, will often be unsuccessful, but should always be justified by their intrinsic value [rather than their effects on crime reduction]…. The reformers’ best strategy is to recognize the multiple aims of the system, rather than sweep them under the carpet. Once these aims are acknowledged, it becomes clear that they do not have to be expressed in the same way everywhere” (p. 194)., Reference: Smith, David J.

Jurors who have been the victim of the same crime as the case they are deciding are more likely to favour a guilty verdict.,", Few, if any, jurisdictions automatically dismiss jurors if they have been victims of a crime, even if they have been victims of the same crime the accused allegedly committed. Previous research has suggested that jury members who knew rape victims were more likely to convict a defendant charged with rape than were jury members who did not know any rape victims., In this study, over 2400 members of the jury pool in El Paso, Texas, observed a video of the trial of a person accused of a home burglary. They were then asked to arrive at an individual verdict of guilty or not guilty. Participants were divided into four groups: (a) those who had not been victims of a home burglary and did not know anyone who had, (b) those who had both been victims and also knew someone who had been a victim, (c) those who had been a victim but knew no other victims or (d) those who had not been victims but knew at least one victim. Those respondents who both had been victims of a home burglary and knew others who also had been victims were most likely (72%) to see the defendant as being guilty.  Those who had not been victims and did not know any victims were least likely (55%) to see the defendant as guilty.  The other two groups (those who had been victimized or who knew someone who had been, but not both) were in the middle (64% and 62%, respectively)., When the respondents were broken down according to their experiences with theft (and the experiences of their acquaintances), the effects were similar but less pronounced.  It does not appear that it is victimization per se that is important: those who had been victims of a violent offence were not more likely to favour a guilty verdict for burglary than were those who had not been victims of any crime (54% vs. 55%, respectively)., Conclusion. It would appear that those who had themselves been the victim of a household burglary or knew someone who had been similarly victimized were more likely to favour a guilty verdict for a similar crime.  It does not appear, however, that the effect is one of simple victimization: these data would suggest that the crime must be similar for there to be an effect on a juror’s verdict. What is not known, however, is what the mechanism is for this effect. It could be that those who have experienced a similar victimization (directly or vicariously) use a relaxed standard of proof necessary for a guilty finding. Alternatively, those with direct or indirect experience with a similar crime may give more weight to the evidence from prosecution witnesses.  Whatever the mechanism might be, the findings suggest that extra caution would be advisable in considering whether to allow those who have been victims of similar crimes to serve on juries., Reference: Culhane, Scott E., Harmon M. Hosch, and William G. Weaver. (2004) Crime Victims Serving as Jurors: Is There Bias Present?  Law and Human Behaviour, 28(6), 649-659., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV7N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-7-no-4-%E2%80%93-august-2005,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 7, No. 4 – August 2005",Regular Issue,2005
Heightened stress affects the ability of witnesses to identify offenders.,", A person who witnesses a crime almost always experiences stress.  Stress may affect the ability of the witness to recall details of the crime or the crime scene or to identify the face of the offender.  This paper reviews 16 published articles with 27 independent estimates of face identification, and an additional 18 articles with 36 independent estimates of recall of matters other than the perpetrator’s face., Overall, there was “clear support for the hypothesis that heightened stress has a negative impact on eyewitness identification accuracy” (p. 694) of faces.  The effect was largest for “staged crime” experiments – those studies in which the experimenter had staged a crime (often a theft) that the participants observed and thought was a real crime.  “The overall negative impact of heightened stress on accuracy of face identification was due entirely to a substantial effect on hit [accurate identification] rate for target present lineups [those lineups in which the actual perpetrator was included].  The correct rejection rate for target absent lineups was unaffected by stress level” (p. 695).  In practical terms, this means that witnesses who are asked to pick the offender out of a lineup in which the actual offender is present are most likely to show the negative impact of stress.  The failure of a highly stressed witness to pick a suspect out of a lineup should, therefore, be given less weight than it might otherwise be given. High stress does not appear to increase the likelihood that a person will incorrectly identify someone as the offender from a lineup in which the actual perpetrator is not present., Conclusion. When the police have apprehended a suspect and they place that person in a lineup, a witness who was highly stressed at the time of the criminal incident is less likely to be able to identify the suspect as the offender than would a person who did not experience stress at the time.  Pooling across studies, witnesses experiencing low stress at the time of the incident were correct in their identifications 50% of the time.  This was reduced to 33% accuracy under high stress.  In interpreting the meaning of a failure to identify a possible suspect, then, it would appear to be important to know the witness’ (reported) level of stress at the time that the crime occurred., Reference: Deffenbacher, Kenneth A., Brian H. Bornstein, Steven D. Penrod, and E. Kierman McGorty.  (2004). A Meta-Analytic Review of the Effects of High Stress on Eyewitness Memory.

"For sex offenders released from prison and living in the community, residence restrictions prohibiting them from living in certain areas seldom make sense.",", In Florida, residence restrictions apply to sex offenders sentenced for crimes involving victims under age 18.  These restrictions typically prohibit those released from prison for these offences from living within 1000 feet of a school, daycare centre, park, playground, school bus stop, or “other place where children regularly congregate” (p. 170). One convicted sex offender noted, “I couldn’t live in an adult mobile home park because a church was 880 feet away and had a children’s class that met once a week.  I was forced to move to a motel where right next door to my room was a family with three children – but it qualified under the rule.”, This study examined the perceptions of 135 men who were convicted of sex offences in Florida and who were subject to restrictive residency restrictions.  The statutes under which such restrictions are imposed exist in 14 U.S. states and are based on the questionable presumption that sex offenders have a very high rate of re-offending (See Criminological Highlights 3(3)#3, 5(1)#4, 6(3)#3, 6(6)#8)., From a public safety perspective, one of the most basic problems with such rules is that prisoners have difficulty finding a place to live.  Approximately half of the offenders who were interviewed for this study could not return to their owned or rented homes after being released. Forty-four percent reported that they could not live with supportive family members because of the residency restrictions, and approximately half indicated that they had suffered financially and/or emotionally because of the rules.  Only 2 of the 135 reported that they saw these restrictions as an effective way to reduce the temptation to offend. Most noted that the restrictions were silly.  As one respondent noted, “It doesn’t matter where a sex offender lives if he sets his mind on reoffending… He can just get closer by walking or driving.  The 1000-foot rule is just a longer leash; I don’t see the point” (p. 174).  “Many respondents pointed out that they have always been careful not to reoffend in close proximity to their homes, so geographic restrictions provided little deterrence. The rule ‘serves no purpose but to give some people the illusion of safety’ said one respondent” (p. 174). Another respondent noted, “I never noticed how many schools and parks there were until I had to stay away from them” (p. 174). The Florida rule allows those subject to the restriction to appeal to the court for an exception.  Those who reported being successful in their appeals (typically because of the hardship that the rule imposed) were given exemptions without any assessment of their risk factors or other background characteristics., Conclusion. Legislatures often pass laws that sound like ‘quick fixes’ to complex problems. Sex offender recidivism, whatever its rate, is obviously a serious problem. The difficulty with laws such as these residence restrictions is that they may make it more difficult for offenders to reintegrate safely into the community.  Blanket restrictions such as these “may fail to address individualized risk factors that are related to potential offending patterns” (p. 175).  It is suggested that restrictions should be “sensible and feasible and should be based on a thorough assessment of past offence patterns and current risk factors” (p. 176)., Reference: Levenson, Jill S. and Leo P. Cotter. (2005) The Impact of Sex Offender Residence Restrictions: 1,000 Feet from Danger or One Step from Absurd?

The behaviour of parents appears to be an important determinant of whether or not a youth acquires delinquent friends: Young people who spend a lot of time away from home in unsupervised settings and whose parents do not know where they are appear to be more likely to have delinquent friends than are youths who spend more time alone or in supervised settings or whose parents know their whereabouts.,", The supervision of adolescent children by adults can be accomplished in a number of ways: directly –   by way of having an adult (not necessarily the parent) physically present observing the activity of the youths – or indirectly, through communication with the youth or other adults (e.g., the parents of friends) who know where the youth is., This study examined youths’ self-reports of whether their friends engaged in various delinquent behaviours. Data were gathered from both the young people themselves and from a parent. Children who reported that their parents knew where they were tended to have parents who were more actively involved in their lives in other dimensions (e.g., spending time together). These same children tended to have fewer delinquent friends than did youths whose parents did not know where they were or whom they were with.  It would appear that spending a lot of time away from the home and being unsupervised is associated with having delinquent friends. However, spending unsupervised time at home is not associated with having delinquent friends unless that time is during summer days. Those who reported being unsupervised during the daytime in the summer were more likely to have delinquent friends than were those under some form of supervision.  Unsupervised time at home after school or in the evenings did not appear to be associated with having delinquent friends., “Adolescents with strong emotional bonds to their parents are less prone than others to acquire [delinquent] friends” (p. 95).  It appears that this relationship “is mediated to a substantial degree by parental supervision.  Parents who are close to their children, it seems, are more consistently conscious of their children’s associates, and that awareness reduces the chances that their children will take up with delinquent friends” (p. 96)., Conclusion. These results suggest that “the family exerts an indirect effect on delinquency through its influence on the kinds of friends that children acquire” (p.99).  To some extent, of course, parents may not be able – in part because of constraints on their own lives – to be fully aware or to control directly how their adolescent children spend their time.  However, indirect supervision – largely through communication with the adolescent and other parents or others who may know of the youth’s activities – “appears to be more of a matter of parental choice and thus more indicative of engaged parents.  Together, these two forms of supervision exert substantial but largely independent effects on delinquent associations” (p. 99).  In addition, of course, communities (through various programs for youth) may well be able to contribute to active, but indirect, supervision through the provision of attractive programs for youth., Reference: Warr, Mark.

People may not be as punitive as they sound when they answer questions about criminal justice punishment. A Scottish study demonstrates that different ways of asking questions about sentencing and punishment result in quite different findings.,", Scottish respondents to a standard public opinion survey indicated overwhelmingly that they thought judges were out of touch with what ordinary people think about punishment (79%) and that sentencing is too lenient (70%).  One could easily conclude that Scotland, like many western countries, has fallen prey to populist punitiveness. Though most people (88%) indicated that they are interested in crime and justice matters, most also indicated that they knew little or nothing about levels of crime (59%), or what happens in court (70%) or in prison (83%). At the same time, these same people were willing to answer questions about these matters., When dealing with actual cases, however, the average person made recommendations on sentencing similar to the decisions made by members of the judiciary. In addition to data from a standard survey, this study used focus group discussions and discussions from a large day-long meeting of ordinary citizens to try to understand views about sentencing and punishment.  The main finding was that views of sentencing are “more nuanced and contradictory” than they are usually thought to be: “Punitive attitudes exist alongside more liberal views” (p. 246).  For example, focus groups favoured “more extensive use of constructive community based [sentences] instead of short prison sentences for less serious offenders” especially when costs were made salient. These results are, in fact, quite similar to Canadian findings (See Criminological Highlights, 4(1)#5)., The difficulty for those interested in sensible criminal justice policy is what might be called a “narrative of insecurity” where people believe that crime is a growing problem, especially among young people, and have lost faith in the institutions of society – judges, courts, and prisons – that they have been repeatedly told can control crime.  “This lack of confidence may be, at least in part, a reflection of the loss of faith in authority and expert knowledge more generally and not simply a response to perceived failures of criminal justice institutions in particular” (p. 254). On the other hand, when faced with the task of trying to craft outcomes for an individual case, ordinary citizens were more interested in finding a constructive offending-reducing solution than they were in expressing punitive values.  At the same time, people did not appear to make clear distinctions among the causes of crime, crime prevention, and punishment policies. “People’s talk about crime and punishment sometimes reflects anxieties and insecurities about living in the modern world” (p. 252).  Hence it is not surprising that attitudes are not based solely on information.  Discussion, and thinking about crime and punishment, may lead people to express more liberal attitudes toward punishment. This is not because people have more information, but rather because what is salient to them may change as a result of more thought., Conclusion. “Politicians should approach survey results with more care. The evidence from the results presented here and elsewhere suggests that the public are not as punitive as survey data suggest. There is evidence of public support for more rational penal policies. There is sadly little evidence of political leadership prepared to argue this case” (p. 254)., Reference: Hutton, Neil.

Crime suspects who are innocent are especially vulnerable to making false confessions when “normal” police interrogation techniques are used.,", False confessions by innocent accused persons have been shown to be the second most common cause of known wrongful convictions. (Wrongful convictions are most likely to be caused by eyewitness mis-identifications.)  “Innocence” in these studies is now typically determined by studying only DNA-exonerated defendants.  False confessions often arise out of police interrogations conducted by those who start with the assumption that the suspect is, in fact, guilty., Interrogations are not designed to get information as much as they are designed to get information that will ensure a finding of guilt. In “pre-interrogation interviews,” it has been shown that people – police officers included – are often no better than chance at determining guilt. (See Criminological Highlights 2(6)#8, 5(4)#5). Consequently, “innocence does not protect a suspect from interview-based judgements of deception” (p. 217).   Another non-protection comes from standard police warnings (see Criminological Highlights 5(5)#5): Innocent people (especially those without a criminal record) are more likely to waive their right to silence in part because they feel that they have nothing to hide.  It would appear that innocent suspects’ belief in justice leads them down a path that ultimately puts them at increased risk of wrongful conviction:  Innocent suspects appear to be more likely to waive their rights to a full police identification lineup, figuring that simply showing a single photo to a witness will lead to their exoneration., Interrogation, then, is a “guilt-presumptive process” where interrogators look for confirmatory evidence and tend to ignore evidence that does not fit with their presumption. With “guilt” as the starting point, interrogators are taught a nine step process that is “designed to get suspects to incriminate themselves by increasing the anxiety associated with denial and minimizing the perceived consequences of confession” (p. 220).  These nine steps can be seen as attempts to create three processes: (1) isolation, (2) confrontation “in which the suspect is accused of the crime, presented with evidence, real or manufactured, and blocked from denial,” (p. 221) and (3) minimization, in which the crime is morally justified or the suspect’s role is minimized leading suspects to see confession as a way of escaping further interrogation.  Courts have tended to reject confessions where direct promises or threats are made, “But courts have not similarly excluded confessions drawn from threats and promises that were merely implied by minimization techniques” (p. 222).  Many of the confessions later proven to be false come about after very long interrogation sessions in which the confession is made partly because the innocent suspect, believing that the justice system would not falsely convict an innocent person, wishes to end the interrogation.  Thus the innocent target of the interrogation confesses, assuming that the confession will end the immediate ordeal and that his or her innocence will be made obvious by other evidence., Conclusion. Innocence puts innocent suspects at risk to making false confessions in five ways: “1. With confidence, police investigators… presume innocent suspects guilty; 2. Naively believing that truth and justice will prevail, innocent suspects waive their rights to silence and to counsel; 3. Despite or because of their plausible and vigorous denials, innocent suspects trigger highly confrontational interrogations; 4. Certain interrogation techniques (e.g., isolation, false evidence, minimization) increase the risk of false confession; 5.

American prosecutors are more likely to request harsh sentences in cases that receive large amounts of press coverage.,", Previous research suggests that two factors are important in determining the amount of press coverage a case gets.  First, the unusual or the spectacular case is more likely to be covered by media outlets than is the mundane case. Second, killings involving victims who are white or female appear to attract more publicity than other killings.  In the United States, it is argued that “prosecution is a political process and prosecutors have a political stake in how their actions are perceived…. When a case is in the public view, prosecutors may feel pressure to take a punitive stance… [In interviews] many prosecutors indicated that they would not plea bargain a case if it was receiving media attention” (p. 63)., This paper first examined the press coverage of 209 murder cases in Baltimore, Maryland, that met statutory criteria that allowed the prosecutor to ask for “life without parole” rather than the normal sentence of “life.”  The focus was on whether or not the prosecutor filed a motion that he or she would seek a penalty of life in prison without parole eligibility. Various predictors of the prosecutor’s decision to seek “life without parole” were examined including the strength of the prosecutor’s case, various characteristics of the victims and of the offenders, aggravating and mitigating factors in the case, the “heinousness” of the crime (e.g., the presence of reports of torture or of there being blood spattered everywhere), and the amount of press coverage that the case had received., The results showed that the amount of press coverage that a case received was a predictor of the prosecutor’s decision to seek “life without parole” above and beyond all other factors of the cases that were measured. Holding these other factors constant, it was estimated that for average cases 11% of the cases with no press coverage resulted in a motion from the prosecutor for “life without parole.”  If there was one article about the case in the local newspapers, the probability increased to 18%.  Cases with 2 or more press articles had a 28% chance of having a “life without parole” motion filed by the prosecutor., Conclusion. “Prosecutors operate in dual worlds.  They are charged with seeking justice, yet they are restrained by such practical considerations as their electable image” (p. 72) in jurisdictions in which prosecutors are elected.  In this study, it was shown that even one newspaper article about a case dramatically increased the likelihood that a prosecutor would seek a higher penalty, when all other aspects of the case were held constant.  The question that is, of course, unanswered by this study is whether prosecutors who are appointed, rather than elected, would seek more punitive sentences solely as a result of press coverage when career advancement, reputation among peers and reputation in their home communities, rather than electability, could be affected., Reference: Bierie, David and Kathryn Murphy (2005) The Influence of Press Coverage on Prosecutorial Discretion: Examining Homicide Prosecutions, 1990-2000.

Why don’t the police stop crime?  Largely because they are not well placed to do so.,"The public often looks to the police to stop almost all types of crimes – from household burglaries, vandalism, and impaired driving to domestic violence, gun crimes, gang violence, and pornography (though they typically are not seen as responsible for preventing crimes involving senior officers of large corporations such as Hollinger, Inc.)  If this is the way in which they are seen, why do we have so much crime? A number of different answers can be offered., First, their main role in dealing with crime has to do with apprehension of offenders and aiding in their prosecution.  This has little effect on crime rates.  Though some crime is avoided through the apprehension and imprisonment of serious offenders, the impact of these activities on overall crime rates is limited (see  Criminological Highlights, 3(1)#1).  The presence of the police generally may have a deterrent effect. This is sometimes evident in property crime sprees when police go on strike or when, for other reasons, they are not available for apprehending offenders. However, their overall impact on crime in normal circumstances is clearly limited, and it is probably limited to certain types of offences., Second, “there is increasing recognition that policing is not just the business of … police forces,” and that “problem oriented strategies involve cooperation in crime reduction with a wider range of departments and agencies” (p. 5).   Long term trends in crime rates (e.g., the decrease in reported rates of serious violence that have occurred in the U.S. and to some extent in Canada in the past 10-15 years) appear to have little to do with the police.  Though the police sometimes take credit for crime drops (e.g., New York City – see Criminological Highlights, 1(4)#5 and this issue, #2), the evidence often is otherwise., Third, it appears that many traditional police tactics are not very effective. Much crime is not detectable by the police and is unaffected by traditional unsystematic police patrols. This activity consumes large portions of police budgets yet it appears to have little overall impact.  This is not surprising: crimes are rare events and it is unlikely either that a police officer would be in a position to intervene or apprehend offenders at the scene of a crime.  Increasing patrol density does not appear to have an impact on crime just as decreased “response times” seldom affect crime levels.  The theory that through dealing aggressively with minor incivilities, crime can be reduced, though popular, appears to be without empirical foundation (see Criminological Highlights, 5(1)#6; 3(3)#1). Police organizations have a range of legitimate priorities and concerns that may, at times, not be consistent with strict enforcement of the law., Finally, even if certain techniques could be identified that were effective, the police organization is one that can easily resist change. In part change in police organizations is difficult to accomplish because “discretion increases as one moves down the hierarchy” (p. 15) in police organizations.  Evidence-based policies are therefore, more difficult to implement than they would be in other organizations., Conclusion.  To say that the police are not an important force in preventing crime is not a criticism of police organizations.  “[Police] need to be alert to the dangers of concentrating single-mindedly on traditional approaches to crime reduction.  Doing so not only has inherent dangers, but it can also divert attention from other tasks and objectives of policing” (p. 19).  One might suggest, therefore, that those responsible for policies related to policing should examine carefully how police resources can best be allocated to accomplish the various responsibilities allocated to the police.  Such an approach might lead to a different, and more effective, allocation of scarce resources., Reference: Dixon, David (2005) Why Don’t the Police Stop Crime?

Widely publicized police interventions in three American cities show more consistency in their claims than in their effects in reducing homicide rates.,", During the 1990s, homicide rates were dropping in many American cities.  It was inevitable, therefore, that there would be a “chorus of self-congratulation” from politicians and police chiefs who could claim to have changed some part of the criminal justice system prior to or during the drop in reported crime.  Hence aggressive policing, youth curfews, targeting career criminals, adding more police officers, and policies that encouraged community policing were all used to explain local crime drops. These explanations ignored the fact that the programs were typically implemented locally, but the “crime drop” was widespread., This study looked at homicide rates in three cities with highly publicized crime reduction programs: Boston (Operation Ceasefire), New York (Comstat) and Richmond, Virginia (Project Exile).  Using data from 95 large U.S. cities, the basic design involved examining the change in homicide rates in each of these three cities to see if the change could be attributed to the program implemented in that city, given the pre-existing downward trends across the country as well as the known determinants of homicide rates (e.g., resource deprivation)., Boston’s Operation Ceasefire focused on communication with gang youth, telling them in face-to-face meetings that firearm possession would not be tolerated, and that a tough approach toward youth gangs would be followed as long as the problem existed. Those apparently responsible for violence were also told that “all available levers would be pulled to ensure swift and tough punishment of violators” (p. 423). New York’s Comstat focused on being intolerant of minor crimes and disorder and aggressively restoring order, as well as making the police managers “responsible” for crime patterns in their districts.  Richmond’s Project Exile used a traditional deterrence and/or incapacitation logic, focusing on harsher penalties for violence or drug crimes in which firearms were used. Extensive use was made of advertising the criminal justice consequences of illegal firearm possession and use., All three cities, like U.S. cities on the whole, showed decreases in homicide rates.  At the beginning of the interventions, Boston’s homicide rate was about 18 (per 100,000 in the population), New York’s was about 20, and Richmond’s was about 70. [In contrast, homicide rates in Canada’s 9 largest cities have averaged between 1.25 and 2.86 in the last decade.]   In Boston, the drop in youth firearms homicides was insignificant once existing trends in other cities and other known contributors to homicide were taken into account. In New York there was no evidence of an effect of the police intervention program on homicides overall, or on firearms homicides in particular.  In Richmond there was a significant decline in firearms homicides when other known determinants of homicide were taken into account, but not when looking at homicide rates in isolation from other factors., Conclusion. One of the difficulties with all evaluations of single-city programs such as these is that the programs themselves are multi-faceted, and the manner in which they are implemented and the cities themselves vary considerably.  In addition, different evaluations of these same programs have arrived at a range of different findings.  The variation in findings is not surprising, given that there is no unambiguously “best” or broadly accepted model for evaluating programs such as these.  Indeed, part of the problem may be that homicide rates themselves vary dramatically and the effect of interventions may be specific to local conditions, including local homicide rates.  Richmond’s homicide rate varied from a low of about 36 per hundred thousand in the population (in 2001) to a high of 80 (in 1994) – rates that are dramatically higher than the average U.S. city. Large Canadian cities show much less year-to-year variation.  A conservative conclusion, therefore, might be that one cannot be confident that any of these highly publicized programs would have a significant impact on homicides (or gun homicides) in cities in which they might be implemented., Reference: Rosenfeld, Richard, Robert Fornango, and Eric Baumer.  (2005) Did Ceasefire, Comstat, and Exile reduce homicide?  Criminology and Public Policy, 4(3), 419-450., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV7N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-7-no-5-%E2%80%93-november-2005,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 7, No. 5 – November 2005",Regular Issue,2005
"In the 14 years ending in 2003, 340 people convicted of serious crimes in the U.S. were found to be innocent. This number almost certainly underestimates the number of wrongful convictions. Nevertheless, these cases help identify factors associated with false convictions.",", It is difficult for a defendant, once convicted, to prove conclusively that he or she is innocent of the crime.  The use of DNA evidence, beginning in 1989, provided one mechanism for proving innocence.  Other convicted people have been exonerated on the basis of new evidence which demonstrated that the defendant had no role at all in the offence.  This paper uses a very strict definition of innocence. For example, cases in which there was strong evidence of factual innocence, but “unexplained physical evidence of the defendant’s guilt” are excluded.  In 263 of the 340 cases, the charges were dismissed by a court after new evidence, such as DNA, emerged. Interestingly, however, in some cases – including rape cases in which the convicted defendant was exonerated by DNA – prosecutors maintained their beliefs in the defendant’s guilt. In one rape case, prosecutors maintained that the original defendant was guilty even after DNA evidence (commissioned over the objections of the state) implicated a previously convicted serial rapist., Most of the exonerations were for murder (60%) or for rape/sexual assault (36%).  About a third of the murder exonerations involved people sentenced to death.  The pattern of exonerations almost certainly reflects the amount of effort expended in examining potentially false convictions rather than the pattern of actual false convictions. It also reflects the types of evidence that are available in different types of criminal cases.  Robbery trials are considerably more likely to occur than rape/sexual assault trials.  Eyewitness misidentifications (which for the most part occur only in the case of strangers) are, therefore, more likely in robberies than in rapes.  In the 121 exonerations in rape cases, almost all (88%) were originally convicted on the basis of mis-identification.   DNA was used to clear most of the falsely convicted rape defendants, but DNA evidence is for the most part irrelevant in robberies. If mis-identifications in cases of robbery are no less prevalent than in rape cases, one would expect very large numbers of false convictions for robbery. But DNA evidence is almost always absent in robbery cases and there may be less effort expended investigating the convictions of those convicted of robbery than there is in convictions for rape. One would suspect, therefore, that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of falsely convicted robbery defendants., Wrongful convictions are disproportionately likely to be identified in cases of capital murder either because more effort is spent in examining these cases and/or because there are more false convictions in these serious cases. The latter explanation could occur because of the enormous pressures to solve heinous crimes.  “Considering the huge discrepancies between the exoneration rates for death sentences, for other murder convictions, and for criminal convictions generally…. [it seems likely that] we are both much more likely to convict innocent defendants of murder – and especially capital murder – than of other crimes, and a large number of false convictions in non-capital cases are never discovered because nobody ever seriously investigates the possibility of error” (p. 533).  In addition, of course, for the most part only those with long sentences or facing the death penalty ever get a chance to prove their innocence: the average time from conviction to exoneration is more than 11 years (p. 535).  The reasons for false convictions vary.  In many instances the central problem was a mistake. For example, it is known that white witnesses make many errors in the eyewitness identification of black suspects. In addition, false confessions are not uncommon (see Criminological Highlights 7(4)#7). But “in at least 60 of the 340 exonerations, the defendant was deliberately falsely accused at trial….” (p.543)., Conclusion. It is clear that there are large numbers of wrongful convictions in U.S. trials. Canada has also had a number of highly celebrated wrongful convictions. It would appear from this paper that wrongful convictions are likely to be found wherever effort is spent in finding them.  Hence, apparently low numbers of cases of convicted persons who later are completely exonerated may only reflect the lack of resources available to investigate these cases., Reference: Gross, Samuel R., Kristen Jacoby, Daniel J.

Increased imprisonment in New Zealand in recent years has more to do with “penal politics” than with crime.,", New Zealand’s imprisonment rate in 2004 was about 174 per hundred thousand residents, second only to the U.S. among OECD countries. Most of the increase occurred in the previous 15 years – a period during which crime, if anything, decreased. In 1980, the imprisonment rate (per hundred thousand residents) was 88; by 1990 it had risen to 117.  (In comparison, Canada’s imprisonment rate, which has been fairly stable since the early 1960s, was 103 per hundred thousand residents in 2002/3.), In 1999, a “Citizens Initiated Referendum” obtained 92% support for the view that there should be “minimum sentences and hard labour for all serious offences” (p. 305).   The referendum results became a standard against which subsequent sentencing legislation could be compared.  For example, legislation in 2002 increased some penalties, “exhort[ed judges] to make more use of maximum penalties” (p. 305), restricted parole opportunities for violent offenders, made community risk the sole factor to be considered in deciding parole, and allowed victims to attend and/or provide written statements for parole hearings.  Prior to 2002, law-and-order politics had been associated mainly with attempts by the police to generate support for their organizations. By 2002, all political parties except the Green Party had formed a consensus supporting punitive approaches: Crime was seen as a serious, central problem to be responded to with tough measures. Academics and a Governor General who had suggested that prisons wouldn’t solve the crime problem were denounced as being “anti-populist.” It appears that there were four “distinctive factors, beginning in the mid-1980s… ultimately coalescing and converging in the late 1990s” (p. 307) that account for the change in New Zealand’s crime policy., First, economic problems in the 1970s and 1980s combined with dramatic changes in government social policies led to a “widespread decline in trust of politicians… [and] dissatisfaction with the democratic processes” (p. 308).  Dramatic changes were made in the manner in which governments were elected and it became easier for referendums to be held., Second, at a time when New Zealand society was changing (racially, economically, socially, and politically) “three incidents of mass murder between 1990 and 1992 allowed concerns about the general direction of New Zealand society to surface” (p. 311).  Reported crime was increasing, and even when reported crime rates stabilized in the mid-1990s, the public appeared to continue to believe that crime was increasing.  As in Canada, crime in one’s own neighbourhood was not seen as being as much of a problem as was crime elsewhere.  Nevertheless, the public perceived crime as being out of control and the justice system as being too lenient on those who were sentenced., Third, groups representing victims of crime became more important as a result of a highly publicized brutal attack leading, ultimately, to the 1999 referendum referred to above. Harsh punishment was the focus of these groups., Finally, the decline in the importance of government, academic, and judicial experts coincided with an increased acceptance of “personal experience, common sense, and anecdote rather than social science research” as the basis of policy.  The families of victims were accorded “expert” status by the media. Social science findings were seen as less persuasive than personal views or accounts., Conclusion: “What seems to have been particularly important in the New Zealand context was the disenchantment with the existing democratic process…” (p. 318).   Though the focus of much of the move toward increasing punitiveness was on violent crime, policies dealing with other types of crimes were more moderate.  Hence, the overall impact was less than it might have been had the punitive provisions been applied to a broader range of offences.  For example, though it became more difficult for violent offenders to be paroled, it became less difficult for others.  Consequently, even in this context, the punitive effects of these changes were somewhat muted., Reference: Pratt, John and Marie Clark.

"Judges’ decisions about bail are not reliable:  when deciding on the pretrial detention or release of identical cases, different judges arrive at different decisions.",", Disparity of judicial decisions has largely been examined in the context of sentencing. In Canada, for example, there are studies demonstrating that judges faced with written descriptions of cases vary dramatically in their recommended sentences (for both adult and young offenders).  In England, where this study was carried out, lay judges (equivalent in background to Justices of the Peace in Canada) decide most cases involving questions of pretrial release. The accused is generally supposed to be released unless it is believed that he or she will not appear in court as required, will offend while on bail, or will interfere with the administration of justice., In this study, 61 lay judges from 47 different adult courts were presented with written descriptions of 27 cases. These cases varied according to the gender, race, age, and criminal history (convictions and bail record) of the accused person; the seriousness of the offence; the relationship of the accused to the victim; strength of community ties; and strength of the prosecution’s case. The judges rated the risk that the offender would abscond (i.e., not appear in court as required), would offend on bail, or would obstruct justice.  Finally, they indicated their overall decision whether to detain or release them pending trial., Decision models – essentially the judge’s “theory” of the factors that were related to each of the outcome variables – were constructed.  Judges used different factors in arriving at their assessments of the cases. For example, when deciding on whether the accused would appear in court, 60% of the judges took account of the accused person’s ties to the community, 49% used previous criminal history, and 20% used the seriousness of offence in arriving at their decision. In attempting to determine whether the accused would offend if released on bail, previous criminal history was important for 85% of the judges. In assessing whether the accused would obstruct justice if released, 61% used offence in making this assessment, and 22% used the relationship to the victim and criminal history., There were three possible decisions for each of the 27 cases: unconditional release, conditional release, and remand in custody.  For each case, the modal (most common) decision was used as the standard.  Between 8% and 59% of the judges disagreed with the modal decision, with an average disagreement of 28%.  On the individual ratings of the likelihood of absconding, offending on bail, and obstructing justice, “there was less variability among judges on those cases where the mean risk posed by the defendant was judged as relatively low” (p. 377).  Generally speaking, as one would expect, “judges’ bail risk judgments were predictive of their subsequent bail decisions, and for the majority of judges the decision was driven by only one of the three risk judgements” (p. 381)., Conclusion: The results suggest that not only is there disagreement on what is perceived to be the appropriate outcome of the bail hearing among lay judges, but these same judges disagree on how the judgement should be arrived at.  However, certain things were predictable: greater disagreement was observed in cases that were judged to pose a greater risk of absconding, offending or obstructing justice while on bail.  The reduction of disparity might be addressed through the use of “well defined and structured guidelines” (p. 282) that “more precisely specify the factors judges should use when making their bail risk judgements, how each factor should be weighted, and how risk judgements should inform bail decisions” (p. 383)., Reference: Dhami, Mandeep K.

Judges are not good predictors of recidivism.,", Fifty years ago, psychologist Paul Meehl noted that when there exists a statistical predictor of some behaviour (e.g., recidivism), individual “clinical” judgments of this same behaviour are typically less effective than the statistical prediction.  In addition, the usual finding is that clinical “adjustments” of a statistically based prediction decrease the accuracy of the prediction., Under the U.S. federal guidelines, a sentence is determined by an “offence score” (based broadly on various characteristics of the offence) and a “criminal history score” (based largely on the offender’s previous convictions).  Though not explicitly developed as an actuarial prediction of recidivism, judges are allowed to depart from the guideline-dictated sentence if they believe that the criminal history score is not an accurate predictor of the offender’s likelihood of committing crimes in the future. This study examined 102 cases in which judges departed from the guideline-designated sentence (50 upward and 52 downward departures). Two measures of recidivism were employed: arrests (including supervised release violations) and reconvictions., Approximately half of the sample re-offended in the ten years following sentencing.  As it turned out, neither the standard criminal history score nor the judge-adjusted criminal history score did a very good job of predicting recidivism.  A potentially more sensitive analysis looked at reoffending within six years after release.  Again, neither the “standard” criminal history score nor the judge-adjusted score performed significantly above chance in predicting recidivism.  The most important finding was that in both analyses the “pre-departure” criminal history score outperformed the judge-adjusted model.  In other words, judges’ clinical judgment about the offender they were sentencing made the prediction of recidivism worse than it already was., Conclusion: Judges, it would seem, “by using their clinical or intuitive judgement to depart from…the Guidelines, did not improve on predictions of recidivism and appear to have worsened them” (p. 746).  One of the purposes of the guidelines was to limit the ability of judges to create non-uniform sentences based on factors not relevant to sentencing.  Clearly departures from the guidelines that are based on judges’ intuitions about reoffending increase, rather than decrease, disparity in sentencing., Reference: Krauss, Daniel A.

"A randomized experiment demonstrates, once again, that boot camps do not reduce recidivism.",", Previous research (see, for example, Criminological Highlights, 2(4)#1, 3(4)#3, 4(1)#1) has not found any persuasive evidence that boot camps reduce recidivism.  This is not a very surprising finding, given that there is little in the boot camp model that relates to our understanding of the causes of criminal behaviour. Nevertheless, the boot camp model appears to have maintained its attractiveness., This study, carried out in California, has a methodological advantage over most other evaluations: it consisted of an experiment in which youths were assigned at random either to a boot camp or to a standard custodial institution and aftercare.  The boot camp program was designed to save money and to reduce recidivism. It targeted the California Youth Authority’s least serious male offenders (mostly property offenders). The two camp sites had almost twice the number of staff as a standard facility.  “Boot camp sites generated lively, lengthy daily schedules of physical training, military drill and ceremony exercises, school classes, group counselling sessions, substance abuse treatment groups…” (p. 314). There was evidence, as in other such settings, that youths in these boot camps felt less fear of being attacked by other youths and were generally enthusiastic about the military milieu, the physical training, and the various treatment programs.  Youths in the boot camp spent less time in custody and more on parole.  While on parole, the boot camp youths received more face-to-face contacts and more drug tests., Youths who dropped out of the boot camp (more than a quarter of those assigned to it) were appropriately maintained as “boot camp” youths in the study. All youths (boot camp and the youths assigned to traditional institutions) were then followed for an average of 7.5 years (range: 2 to 9 years).  Arrests for charges other than probation violations were recorded.  Sixteen different recidivism comparisons were examined: four “offence types” (all, serious, violent, property) and four time periods (one, two, and three years, as well as all available data). In addition, “time to first arrest” was examined for the two groups., Almost all comparisons showed no difference between the boot camp youths and the controls.  The one exception was for the two year follow-up period.  But overall (and for all other time periods) there were no positive effects of the boot camp experience.  In any case, both immediately (year one) and in the long term, boot camp youths were just as likely to reoffend as were youths sent to ordinary custodial facilities., Conclusion. The lack of positive impacts of a boot camp experience is not surprising.  While “many [boot camp] staff were good role models and clearly cared about their cadets, the program itself was not specifically designed to incorporate any of [the elements of] effective [correctional] treatment” (p. 328).  In addition, for political reasons, there was no serious attempt to build in effective treatment. Though “continuously refined in an ad hoc but often creative manner, the [boot camp] was fundamentally a militarized quick fix and its aftercare a hastily designed and unevenly implemented… service… [The program] did not focus much on individual needs or provide much by way of treatment services” (p. 328-9). Thus it is hardly surprising that the boot camp experience had no overall impact., Reference:  Bottcher, Jean and Michael E. Ezell (2005).

How might judges explain to representatives of the mass media why specific decisions were made in criminal cases?  Judges in the Netherlands use a “press judge” – a judge whose responsibility it is to act as a spokesperson for the court.,", One hardly needs research to discover that the public does not have a very deep understanding of the manner in which decisions are made in court, nor does one need to do a content analysis to conclude that mass media stories seldom do an adequate job of describing the complexities of criminal (or other) cases.  How might these related problems be addressed?  The Dutch have institutionalized the position of a “press judge” – a fully qualified judge whose role it is to discuss individual cases and the law with the mass media., Media criticism of judges has been described by an Australian judge as being “a universal phenomenon” (p. 452).  The suggestion has been made that “judges should shoulder part of the blame for inaccurate media reporting [of judicial proceedings] if they fail to actively involve themselves in the way in which public information about the courts is disseminated” (p. 453). The typical approach to addressing this issue is to encourage largely abstract public legal education about the law., In 1974, courts in the Netherlands first appointed press judges, but they did not take an active public role until the late 1980s. In the late 1990s, communication advisors to support press judges were recruited.  These communications advisors “have a predominantly supportive role; stepping into the limelight is a monopoly reserved for press judges” (p. 471)., In their discussions with the media, press judges typically took what might be called an “orientation role” – in which they attempted to give meaning or direction to “raw information.” In a given judgement, then, their role would be to help the journalist frame a story in a manner which was consistent with the court judge’s judgement.  Hence the judge must “resort to a calculation exercise allowing him to determine what form of presentation gives… the best chance of getting the message across in all its integrity” (p. 464).  Judges tried to draw a line between explaining and commenting.  Given their role as “translators” of judgements from the court to the media, it is not surprising that in some instances press judges “suggest to a presiding judge improvements to the text of a judgement so that it would be easier to explain to the media” (p. 466)., Conclusion.  “The institutionalization of the press judge as a function which deserves recognition through a partial exemption from ordinary judicial responsibilities is an indication that the Dutch judiciary is acknowledging the importance of embracing a wider audience…. Addressing a media audience is seen as an almost natural extension of judicial communication, despite the obvious struggle of some press judges to conquer the obstacle of ruthless media editing” (p. 471).  The institution of the press judge is not seen as an attempt of the court to become part of popular culture. Instead it is seen as a move “from an isolationist position to [one in which judges take] a much more outward looking yet nevertheless controlling stance” (p. 471-2)., Reference: Gies, Lieve.

"Traditionally, the Netherlands has had a relatively low imprisonment rate – similar to that of other northern European countries.  Events have recently transpired such that its imprisonment rate is now the same as Canada’s.","The Netherlands is typically seen as a “country not obsessed by crime” (p. 284), in large part because its policies have not been crisis-driven. Since 1990, however, “crises in governance and in criminal justice in particular occurred with such frequency that [crimes] were no longer viewed as isolated incidents but as components of a ‘grand problem’” (p. 285)., During a 40 year period ending in 1990, the prison population in the Netherlands remained more or less constant, while the population of the country slowly increased. One of the reasons for the stability of the prison population is that there was a policy of not placing more than one prisoner per cell.  During the 1980s, however, there was increased pressure on the prison system to accommodate greater numbers of people being sentenced to prison. In order to accommodate this pressure and to avoid building more prisons, those convicted were forced to wait to serve their sentences until a cell became vacant. At the height of this practice, approximately 5000 offenders were on a waiting list to serve their sentences (in a country which, then, had a prison population of about 3000).  But early in the 1990s, new prisons were built and prisoners were quickly found to fill these new institutions (See also, Criminological Highlights, 1(2)#1; 7(1)#2)., Having acquired a taste for imprisonment, the government was unable to eliminate the problem of overcrowding simply by building more prisons.  The population of those detained pending trial was also increasing, and special detention facilities were built.  But the policy of holding prisoners in single-prisoner cells was maintained until a number of critical events (two explosions linked to criminal negligence on the part of the owners of the facilities, unease and anti-Muslim sentiments after 11 September 2001, and the killing of a populist political leader in 2002) helped create an atmosphere in which most residents of the country believed that greater prison capacity was required. It appears that in the early 21st century, an increasing portion of the population of the Netherlands thinks that sentences are too lenient and believe that the government is not doing enough to prevent crime.  Indeed, crime and security were the principal issues in the 2002 general elections. The populist political leader murdered during the campaign had made much of the fact that 40% of the inmates in Dutch prisons were of non-European origin.  Even though a Dutch born environmental activist was convicted of his killing, crime and the need for prisons were linked to immigration policies in residents’ minds.  Crime became  linked to issue of “cultural-security” (p. 293) rather than simply personal security as it had been in earlier decades.  Finally, as Garland (See Criminological Highlights, 3(5)#4) has noted with respect to the U.K. and U.S., experts in the Netherlands apparently have less influence on crime policy than in the past.  No longer, for example, are “correctionalist objectives” prominent in the development of policies related to crime and punishment., Conclusion. The changes that have occurred  in imprisonment policy in the Netherlands appear to have had dramatic effects – shifting the country away from its position as a country with relatively low rates of imprisonment to its current situation of having an imprisonment rate which is almost exactly the same as that of Canada.  No single factor accounts for this shift and, of course, it is equally unclear whether these changes are likely to remain., Reference: Pakes, Francis.

Ireland’s imprisonment rate increased from about 25 to 81 prisoners per hundred thousand residents between 1970 and 2002 in part as a result of a “successful” prison construction policy.,", Imprisonment has increased recently in a number of countries including the U.S. [See Criminological Highlights, 2(6)#2, 6(4)#8], the U.K. [See Criminological Highlights, 6(6)#6] and the Netherlands [See Criminological Highlights,7(1)#1].  Since the size of the prison population and crime rates appear to be quite independent of one another, understanding the determinants of the size of the prison population is not simple.  From the founding of the Irish state in 1922 until the early 1970s, prisons operated in “a marginal area of public policy” (p. 253).  In the early 1970s, “the penal system came under increasing strain” (p. 253-4), and more prisons were opened.  The use of prison sentences had more than doubled by the early 1990s. At that point, because of the high and unpredictable use of temporary absence passes from prison, “there was a poor relationship between the penalty imposed by the court and the time actually served, and there was considerable judicial and public frustration with what became known as the ‘revolving door’ syndrome.” (p. 254)., The challenge facing the government in the mid-1990s was how it should respond to overcrowded prisons, increased official crime rates, and temporary absence programs that had come into disrepute.  In 1994, the government projected that it could set a cap on the prison population of about 2250 prisoners (which would not have necessitated the building of new cells). However, a series of new governments “dispensed with talk of a cap” (p. 254). The number of additional prison spaces that were seen as being “needed” escalated from 210 to 840 to 2000.  The politicization of imprisonment had begun around the time of the general election in 1997 and coincided with a moral panic related to two high profile killings.  Prisons were built and they were filled.  By 2002, Ireland’s rate of imprisonment (81) was one third higher than it had been in 1990 (60) despite the fact that from the time that the prison building program was in its infancy, officially recorded crime rates had begun to decline at a rate that was the steepest in the European Union (a drop of 21% between 1995 and 1999)., The increase was accomplished notwithstanding advice from “a number of high-level review groups [that] emphasized the need to rebalance the system away from imprisonment” (p. 258).  The largest proportional increase in the prison population was due to those on remand awaiting trial. The opening of a new prison allowed recently legislated changes in bail laws to be fully implemented such that bail could be refused to prevent the commission of offences. As has been shown elsewhere (see Criminological Highlights, 1(2)#1),  building new prisons tends to cause an increase in prison populations.  The portion of prisoners on temporary absence dropped by half as there was no longer a need to release prisoners due to overcrowding.  There is also some evidence that sentence lengths increased and that those sentenced to life remained in prison for longer periods of time., Conclusion. In the end, the increase in imprisonment in Ireland appears to have occurred because “when law and order issues became politicized… the finances of the state were sufficiently healthy to accommodate the expectations placed on them.  During previous law and order crises, the system did not have the capacity to respond… A punitive streak has always existed among Irish legislators, but in the past this was tempered by a cold fiscal climate… This may be a very simple explanation for why penal expansion occurred when it did” (p. 264).  More recently, however, there are concerns about the costs and as a result “the bottom line, rather than any desire for penal reform, may force a reconsideration of what constitutes an appropriate scale of imprisonment” (p. 264)., Reference: O’Donnell, Ian.  Imprisonment and Penal Policy in Ireland.

Negative impacts of U.S. imprisonment policies are evident. The public is beginning to understand this. The question is whether political decisions will be made to change crime policies.,", U.S. imprisonment rates have increased from about 200 prisoners per hundred thousand residents in 1980 to about 700 in 2002. [Canada’s rate is about 100.]  This change has “disproportionately affected young African Americans and Latinos” (p. 3).  Women also have been increasingly imprisoned. In 1980 women constituted about 4% of the prison population; by 2001 their portion in the prison population had increased to about 6.7%.  Research has suggested that politicians led public opinion in the war on crime, convincing people that “tough on crime”  policies would reduce crime.  The “war on crime” approach, however, is important in part because it appeals to the “ongoing [American] popularity of individualistic understandings of and solutions to complex social problems” (p. 7)., This book presents data showing that high imprisonment is not a result of particularly high crime rates in the U.S.   Only America’s homicide rates are exceptionally high compared to other western countries. The high homicide rate might be explained as the “catastrophic interaction of… the ubiquity of guns, high rates of economic and racial inequality (especially in the form of concentrated urban poverty), the trade in illegal drugs, and the emergence of a ‘code of the streets’ that encourages the use of violence” (p. 7).  However, “by emphasizing the severity and pervasiveness of ‘street crime’ and framing the problem in terms of immoral individuals rather than criminogenic… social conditions, [American]  politicians effectively redefined the poor – especially the minority poor – as dangerous and undeserving” (p. 8).  The media supported rather than examined or challenged this view., The public does not completely accept this explanation for crime, nor is the public content with imprisonment as a solution to crime.  Popular attitudes and beliefs about crime in the U.S., as in Canada [see, Criminological Highlights, 4(1)#5], are ambivalent and contradictory: “Even when the get-tough mood was at its peak, most Americans were still eager to see a greater emphasis placed on crime prevention and were willing to support a variety of alternatives to incarceration” (p. 9; See also Criminological Highlights, 1(5)#8; 2(4)#5)., Nevertheless the war on crime continues unabated in the U.S. and its consequences have been profound. Drug arrests and incarceration have increased dramatically during a period when drug use appears to be down (p. 163-165). Although illegal drug use rates appear to be similar across racial groups from 1979-2001, the proportion of drug possession charges involving African Americans is about 3 times their proportion in the population. The other proximate causes of American prison growth are well established: changes in sentencing laws, in particular various forms of mandatory minimum sentences and, in many jurisdictions, the virtual elimination of parole release.  All of this is taking place at a time when “the historical evidence… shows no correlation between patterns of incarceration and patterns of crime” (p. 181)., Conclusion. There are viable alternatives to high imprisonment policies. A shift in orientation from a prosecution to a harm reduction approach for drug problems, or a focus on punishments outside of prisons (and a focus on reintegration rather than incarceration) would all appear to be more productive uses of scarce resources.  For these to work, however, politicians have to realize that there would be public support for such approaches., Reference: Beckett, Katherine and Theodore Sasson.  The Politics of Injustice: Crime and Punishment in America (Second edition). 2004.  Sage Publications.

The perception that racial profiling by police takes place can have broad effects in the community at large: It can reduce both citizens’ assessments of the legitimacy of police actions and citizens’ general support of the police.,", There is substantial evidence that “racial profiling” takes place in many locations (see Criminological Highlights 5(4)#2).  In any police questioning of a citizen, it seems likely that the citizen will make attributions on why the stop took place. This paper looks at two questions: What are the consequences that flow from a situation in which a citizen explains police behaviour by attributing it to profiling? What factors shape a citizen’s conclusion that profiling takes place?, Using four separate surveys, this paper examines the hypothesis that “people will evaluate police actions using procedural justice criteria” (p. 255: See Criminological Highlights 4(4)#1).  In the first study, roughly equal numbers of whites, blacks, and Hispanics who had recently been stopped by the police took part in the survey assessing the citizen’s willingness to accept the legitimacy of the police actions.  The predictors of the assessment of the police actions were the same for both minority and white respondents.  Not surprisingly, those who attributed the stop to profiling (on the basis of race, age or sex) were less willing to see the stop as being legitimate.  But those “who experience high quality interpersonal treatment [from the police] – politeness, respect, acknowledgement of their rights – are also less likely to feel that they have been profiled” (p. 259)., A second study (of 18-26 year olds in New York) showed that both white and non-white respondents believe that profiling is prevalent and unjustified.  For non-white respondents, the belief that they themselves had been racially profiled led to poor ratings of the police.  The perception by young people of whether they had received respectful treatment at the hands of the police shaped both their views of whether they had been profiled and their views of the police.  The third survey (of New York residents) showed, not surprisingly, that minorities were more likely than whites to believe that profiling takes place.  This survey also demonstrated that for whites and non-whites the quality of the treatment that they felt they could expect from the police affected their view of whether profiling takes place.   Finally, a telephone survey of New York residents found, once again, that “support for the police is undermined if the police are believed to engage in profiling” (p. 273)., Conclusion.  It would appear that the belief that profiling takes place can undermine the perceived legitimacy of the police.  However, these same data suggest that “the police can maintain their legitimacy by exercising their authority fairly” (p. 273).  The data do not support the view that the public thinks that profiling is the result of prejudice: only 12% of whites and 33% of nonwhites thought that “when the police do stop minorities more frequently than whites, they are doing it out of prejudice” (p. 275).  However, for both white and black respondents, if a police officer profiles, that officer’s behaviour is seen as less legitimate.  “When people indicate that they have experienced fairness from the police and/or when they indicate that the police are generally fair in dealing with their community, they are less likely to infer that profiling takes place” (p. 276).  Three aspects of procedural fairness – quality of decision making, quality of treatment, and inferences about trustworthiness – were found to significantly affect the inferences people make about their interactions with the police” (p. 277)., Reference: Tyler, Tom R. and Cheryl J.

Those Americans who hold the most punitive attitudes about crime are most likely to see crime as being disproportionately committed by blacks.,", Some have suggested that for many middle class white Americans, crime is seen largely as a black phenomenon and have argued that “the support for an increasingly punitive response to crime is grounded in a belief system that constructs crime in terms of race and race in terms of crime…”(p. 360).  However, such statements are often made without strong supportive evidence, even though there is some evidence linking fear of crime to the actual or perceived racial composition of a neighbourhood (See Criminological Highlights, 1(1)#7)., This study examines punitive attitudes of a national sample of Americans, focusing on a complex measure of punitiveness (e.g., support for making sentences more severe, making prisoners work on chain gangs, sending repeat juvenile offenders to adult court) and relates this measure of punitiveness to a measure of the extent to which respondents see crime as a disproportionately black phenomenon., Focusing largely on white respondents, the study shows that those who view crime as disproportionately involving blacks as offenders are more likely to hold punitive attitudes even when the following factors (in addition to demographic factors such as age, education, gender) are statistically held constant: concern about crime, the respondent’s estimate of the proportion of crime that is violent, fear of crime, racial prejudice, and whether the respondent lives in the southern U.S., Each of these other factors also predicts punitive attitudes: for example, those who are politically conservative, those who have high concerns and fear about crime, those who think that much of it involves violence,  and those who are prejudiced also are more punitive.  However,  the overall effect – that those white people who link race to crime (seeing crime as disproportionately caused by blacks) believe that the criminal justice system should be more harsh – holds only for certain types of people. Generally, it is only those from less punitive groups (e.g., from northern states rather than southern states, those not prejudiced rather than more prejudiced) who show the effect .  For those already relatively punitive – those more concerned about crime, those who think that a high proportion of crime involves violence, those high in racial prejudice, or from the southern part of the U.S. – there was no added effect of believing that crime was disproportionately caused by blacks., Conclusion. The “results linking punitive attitudes to the racial typification of crime suggest that there may be a racial overlay to the crime salience issue.  Indeed, it is when concern about crime and the perception that crime is violent are “low” that racial typification of crime is a significant predictor of punitiveness.  In these contexts a racialized crime threat may be substituting for a generalized threat that is presumed by crime salience” (p. 379).  These results may reflect a “modern racism… [that] eschews overt expressions of racial superiority and hostility but instead sponsors a broad ‘anti-black affect’ that equates blacks with a variety of negative traits, and crime is certainly one of those” (p. 380).  For example, “James Q. Wilson’s assertion that ‘it is not racism that makes whites uneasy about blacks moving into the neighbourhoods… it is fear.  Fear of crime, of drugs, of gangs, of violence’ … in one short sentence simultaneously disavows white racism while equating blacks with a list of negative attributes” (p. 380)., Reference: Chiricos, Ted, Welch, Kelly, and Gertz, Marc.

You get what you pay for:  An important predictor of the success of various burglary prevention programs is how much effort went into implementing them.,", When decisions are made about how to prevent certain kinds of crime, the natural tendency is to search for programs that have been shown to be effective.  In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the cost effectiveness of different programs.  “Cost effectiveness” can be measured in two ways. One method would be to make estimates – usually involving some rather arbitrary assumptions about the true costs to the victim – of the cost of victimizations and to measure these costs against the costs of prevention.  A second would be to evaluate how many crimes of a particular kind would be averted with an expenditure of a certain amount (e.g., crimes prevented per million dollars spent)., In this paper, the intensity of efforts to reduce residential burglaries was assessed.  The intensity of a program can be measured in two quite different ways.  In the first place, one can look at the amount of funds put into a program (per household, for example). Alternatively, one can look at the “outputs” of the crime prevention efforts – what actually gets done as part of the crime prevention program., This paper looked at 21 burglary reduction efforts.  All were designed to reduce the number of burglaries in a particular geographic area.  Two measures of intensity were used: input intensity (the total cost of the program including “levered in” costs such as police time, or the time spent by local government employees in publicizing a program) and output intensity (the efforts spent actually doing the crime prevention during the relevant time period)., For two of the programs, inputs were impossible to estimate with any precision because of other activities that were implemented simultaneously.  For the other 19 programs, there was a clear and positive relationship between the overall intensity with which the prevention programs were implemented and the number of burglaries that were prevented. Generally speaking, it appeared that it is the output intensity – the measure of what actually was done rather than simply the amount that was spent or the equipment or personnel costs of the program – that predicted the reduction in burglary rates., Though it would appear that the amount of resources actually expended on crime prevention predicts the success of a program in reducing burglaries, the most “intense” programs were not necessarily the most “cost effective.”   The relationship between “cost effectiveness” (value of burglaries prevented/cost of the scheme) and output intensity was insignificant. This should not be terribly surprising: if one imagines the difference between a minimally expensive program (e.g., getting people to lock their doors) and a very expensive program (providing guards for a neighbourhood), it would not be surprising to find – no matter how costs are calculated – that guards were not “cost effective.”, Conclusion.  The findings suggest that the benefits from a crime prevention program are likely to be roughly proportionate to the efforts put into crime prevention.  There are, it seems, few if any magic potions to rid a neighbourhood of crime with minimal effort., Reference: Bowers, Kate J., Shane D. Johnson, and Alex Hirschfield. (2004).

"The risk that a woman faces of violent victimization from various types of offenders –  strangers, non-strangers, and intimate partners –  appears to be related in similar ways to her age and family structure as well as to the community in which she lives.",", Much research on violent victimization focuses on a single type of violence (e.g., violence carried out by intimate partners or violence carried out by others). Furthermore, most studies examine either the characteristics of the victim, the offender, or the community.  In general, it has been found that younger single women who are poor or members of minority groups have a relatively high likelihood of victimization.  Serious violence against women appears to be more likely to occur in areas of concentrated poverty, and in areas that have high numbers of unemployed males and high concentrations of households headed by women., This study used the 1995 U.S. national victimization survey data which were linked to census data such that characteristics of the respondent’s neighbourhood could be described.  Violent victimization of women is known to have quite different characteristics than violent victimization of men; this study focuses solely on women’s victimization by intimates, strangers, and non-strangers., For all types of violence (stranger, non-stranger, and intimate partner), single women with children were more likely to have been victimized than were single women without children. This latter group was, in turn, more likely to be victimized than were married women.  This relationship was found even when household income, race, and the amount of time the woman spent at home were controlled statistically.  However, younger women, poorer women, and women who moved recently, were also at greater risk of being victimized.  Again, these results tended to hold across types of victimization., The research suggested that “the area [neighbourhood or census tract] characteristic with the strongest direct effect on violence against women [was] the percent of households with children headed by women” (p. 341).  The size of this effect was similar for stranger, non-stranger and intimate partner violence. Race, poverty, and the percent of households with children that were headed by women were highly inter-correlated, and hence their effects were difficult to disentangle.  Nevertheless, in terms of predicting where violent victimizations of women would occur, it was reasonably clear that the woman’s own family structure and the characteristics of the neighbourhood (e.g., the percent disadvantaged or the percent of women-headed households) had independent effects on violent victimizations., Conclusion. “Family structure and community family composition appear to have more consistent and direct effects on women’s violence risk than race, ethnicity or socio-economic status… Family – the most immediate social context of individuals’ lives – represents an important source of either protection from or risk of violence” (p. 349). Furthermore, “different forms of violence are similarly located in communities” (p. 349). One explanation for this strong “family” effect is that “women raising children on their own… have less time and energy to devote to the development of community networks” (p. 350). Such networks can – for the individual and for the community – provide protection [see Criminological Highlights, 1(2)#2, 3(3)#1]., Reference: Lauritsen, Janet L. and Robin J. Schaum. (2004).

"After four decades of research, one cannot conclude with any confidence that there is a causal relationship between the viewing of violent media and criminal violence.",", The research on the effects of the mass media on violence is sometimes confusing. In part, the confusion arises because variables are operationalized in very different ways. Many studies, for example, focus on imitated aggression (e.g., a child imitating what he or she sees on television). In addition, many studies suffer from the possibility that factors other than media exposure might account for an apparent relationship between exposure to violence and subsequent behaviour.  Nevertheless, many individuals and groups have glossed over these important details and have concluded that the media – in particular television – causes criminal violence., This paper focuses on all published research on the relationship between violent media viewing and criminal behaviour that met certain basic methodological criteria.  One criterion was that the research should focus on measures that are close to what is normally considered to be criminal violence (as opposed to, for examples, measures of aggressive play among children). Another criterion was that the study had to establish a temporal order (media exposure before the violence measure) consistent with the hypothesis that media exposure causes violence. Studies also had to attempt to control for spurious factors.  A range of different types of studies were examined including the following:, Looking at all of the studies, it appears that “for boys, there appears to be no more evidence for a positive effect than there is for a negative effect of media violence on violent behaviour” (p. 123).  Of the 23 studies that were relatively sound methodologically that were examined in this paper, seven found positive effects for the TV-violence-leads-to-violent-crime hypothesis, but 3 of these studies showed effects for girls only., One problem is that violent television is common and real-life serious violence is (thankfully) rare. If the effects are interactive, weak, or indirect (e.g., affecting attitudes or beliefs that may or may not lead to violence later) then there could still be effects that research that has been carried out over the past 40 years of research has not yet uncovered. “It would be hard to deny that television could have an effect on [violent] behaviour” (p. 124).  But the same could be said for many things that have not been proven to be causes of violence., Conclusion.  It is clear that if there is an effect of exposure to violence in the mass media on criminal violence, that effect is small and almost certainly limited to a subset of the population that is hard to identify.  Factors that are known to have an effect on the likelihood of violence in children (parental supervision, association with violent peers, parental violence, various early childhood experiences) typically show more consistent effects.  The question one is left with in a world in which exposure to violent mass media is almost certainly uncontrollable is a simple one: given the inconsistency of the findings in this area, does it not make sense to search for factors that are more important in determining the level of criminal violence and that might be affected by local, provincial, or national policies?, Reference: Savage, Joanne.

African American youths in the U.S. who are exposed to substantial amounts of racial discrimination are more likely to be involved in crime than are comparable black adolescents who have experienced less discrimination.,"Background.  Homicide rates involving African American youths in the U.S. are approximately 9 times higher than those for white youths. Similarly, self-reports of assaults, robberies and other crimes by black adolescents are typically considerably higher than those reported by whites. Various explanations have been offered for these group differences. In particular, explanations have focused on differential exposure to certain conditions (e.g., weak social bonds, lack of economic opportunity) that are known to be related to involvement in crime., This study “investigated the possibility that racial-ethnic discrimination fosters negative emotions and attitudes that directly increase a child’s propensity for delinquent behaviour” (p.829). Unlike much of the research examining the link between discrimination and delinquency, this study examined the subjective consequences (such as anger) of discrimination. Data were examined from a sample of 718 black children living in Georgia and Iowa who were interviewed in 1997 and 1999. The youths were between 10 and 12 years old at the time of the first interview. Their primary care giver was also interviewed. The experience of discrimination was assessed through a set of 13 questions (e.g., “How often has someone yelled a racial slur or racial insult at you just because you are an African American?” or “How often have the police hassled you just because you are African American?”). Delinquency was also measured through self-reports., The results demonstrated that most of the youths had experienced some form of racial discrimination.  In addition (and consistent with other studies), the majority of the participants reported at least one instance of delinquent behaviour in the previous year. Moreover, a relationship between delinquency and the experience of discrimination was found for both boys and girls at each interview. Further, it was demonstrated statistically that the causal path is likely to go from discrimination to delinquency. In other words, the data were consistent with the hypothesis that increased discrimination leads to greater offending. Equally noteworthy, an examination of those youths who did not report any delinquency at the first interview suggests that the experience of discrimination is associated with the onset of delinquent behaviour. These findings hold even when other variables (e.g., association with deviant peers, inadequate parenting) are held constant. The analysis further suggests that – for boys - the effects of discrimination increased feelings of anger, depression and the belief that violence is often necessary to defend one’s rights, to achieve respect, etc. In turn, these sentiments led to increased delinquency. For girls, the intervening factors were similar but not identical (that is, only anger and depression appeared to mediate the effect of discrimination)., Conclusion. This paper “found that discrimination predicted delinquent behaviour in [a] sample of African American children after [the researchers] controlled for quality of parenting, affiliation with deviant peers, and prior conduct problems” (p.848) for both girls and boys. These findings do not challenge other well established explanations for group differences in offending. Instead, they highlight another factor that helps explain high rates of offending among certain black youths. The results of this study clearly suggest that societies that systematically expose their most vulnerable members to discriminatory rhetoric and practices are likely to pay the price in increased crime., Reference: Simons, Ronald L; Yi-Fu Chen; Eric A.

Men – especially black males – with a prison record in America will have considerably more difficulty in obtaining entry level jobs than will those who have never been incarcerated.,", Background.  As in Canada, most prisoners in the U.S. will eventually be returned to the community.  In fact, approximately half a million American inmates are released from U.S. prisons each year. Roughly 91,000 offenders were released from Canadian prisons in 2001 after serving time for a criminal offence. These figures are of particular concern when one recalls findings from previous research which demonstrated a relationship between imprisonment and the (in)ability of a person to find employment. However, one of the problems with these prior studies is that they have only been correlational in nature. As such, the possibility remains that it is not incarceration per se that disadvantages a person in search of a job, but rather some other related factor (e.g., possessing fewer relevant job skills)., This study used an experimental design in which black and white male research assistants pretended to be ordinary job applicants and applied for entry level jobs with 350 different employers in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin area. They randomly described themselves as either having a criminal record or not. Two different people applied for each position - one of whom either indicated that he had a criminal record when asked (a situation which occurred in 74% of the jobs applications or interviews) or simply listed his parole officer as a reference if information about his criminal history was not requested.  In all other ways, the two applicants did not differ., The results were dramatic. Of the white applicants, 34% of those without a criminal record were “called back” (to be offered the job or for a formal interview) compared to only 17% with a criminal history. For black applicants, while 14% of those without a criminal record were called back, a mere 5% of those with a prison record were contacted. In other words, when comparing the white applicant with no criminal record to the black person with a criminal record, the likelihood of the latter obtaining a job was reduced by approximately 85%. This effect held for those employers who specifically asked about the applicant’s criminal record as well as those who did not explicitly request this information. Similarly, the pattern of findings was the same for applicants with and without personal contact with a decision maker (i.e. those who were either asked simply to fill out an application or were given an initial interview)., Conclusion. The presence of a criminal record renders the reintegration of ex-offenders into the community as productive citizens more difficult. One important hurdle for individuals who want to achieve the goal of successful reintegration is to acquire a job. This study demonstrates conclusively that having a criminal record makes this objective a considerably greater challenge. In addition, it demonstrates that being black and having a criminal record constitute two enormous - albeit separate - impediments to getting a job. These results are consistent with previous research (Criminological Highlights, 5(3) #7) which shows that imprisonment has a permanent effect on wages. More specifically, those who have been incarcerated are likely to have reduced wage income. Further, the effect of imprisonment increases as workers get older. Hence, the rise in wages that ex-offenders experience as they age is smaller than the increases received by non-offenders. Taken together, these findings demonstrate not only that a criminal record renders it more difficult for the ex-inmate to enter the work force but that people with criminal records are also more likely – once employed – to be trapped in low paying jobs. Clearly, a criminal record has costs for both the offender as well as society., Reference: Pager, Devah (2003). The Mark of a Criminal Record.

"Sex offenders are not more likely than other types of lawbreakers to be re-arrested for a crime.  In fact, the vast majority of them - if re-apprehended - are arrested for an offence that is not sexual in nature.",", Background. In all 50 U.S. states, certain types of sex offenders are required to register their addresses with law enforcement agencies and are additionally liable - in many jurisdictions - to have their whereabouts disclosed to the public. The theory behind these practices appears to be that “without intervention or some sort of surveillance, sex offenders will never stop committing sex crimes” (p.60). However, previous research (e.g., Criminological Highlights, 5(1), #4) has suggested that the rate at which apprehended sex offenders commit subsequent sex crimes is low – typically less than 10% within 3-5 years of release. Nevertheless, some jurisdictions – working on the belief that sex offence registries and notification procedures are effective and that “gateway” crimes exist which predict sex offending – have begun considering the expansion of registration obligations to include other criminal activity such as burglary. Since many sex offenders also have records of burglary, the theory seems to rest upon the assumption that these other crimes (e.g., burglary) are predictors of sex offending. The difficulty with this logic is that most repeat offenders (of sexual crimes or otherwise) have records of property offences such as burglary.
 
This study examines ‘sex offence’ re-offending relative to the re-offending rates of other criminal groups in a cohort of people arrested in Illinois in 1990.  Sex offences constituted only a small proportion (1.2%) of all criminal charges. Most of the sex offenders (69%) were not, in fact, incarcerated for their initial offences., The results showed that those arrested for robbery were the most likely offence group to re-offend (for any offence) within a 5-year follow-up period (75%). In contrast, 45% of sexual offenders were rearrested within five years for some crime. Further, the theory that ‘once-a-sex-offender-always-a-sex-offender’ is challenged by the data on re-arrest for the same offence. Looking across 10 crime groupings, 6.5% of sex offenders were rearrested for the same offence within 5 years – a same-offence recidivism rate that was comparable to those initially charged with homicide, kidnapping, and stalking. In contrast, 18% of robbers, 23% of burglars and 37% of those initially arrested for non-sexual assaults were re-apprehended for the same offence within the identical follow-up period., Not surprisingly, those initially arrested for sex crimes were more likely than other lawbreakers to be re-apprehended for a sex offence within 5 years. Since only 6.5% of sex offenders were re-arrested within this period for a crime of a sexual nature, it is not clear that registries for this type of offender would be an efficient means of reducing future criminal activity., Conclusion. The existing evidence suggests that sex offender registries are not likely to be effective in stopping crime. (See Criminological Highlights, 4(1), #2 and 5(6), #1). These registries, along with community notification laws, are based on the theory that the same-offence recidivism rates for sexual offenders are remarkably high. This study demonstrates exactly the opposite, with re-apprehension rates for this type of criminal activity being comparatively low. Clearly, policies based on misconceptions about the nature of sexual offending will inevitably be ineffective and divert attention and resources away from other more promising strategies., Reference: Sample, Lisa L. and Timothy M. Bray (2003). Are Sex Offenders Dangerous?

"The most likely cause of the over-representation of Aboriginal people in prison in Australia is their relatively high rate of involvement in serious crime. Hence, focusing on the factors known to be causes of Aboriginal crime is likely to be more effective in reducing the over-representation of Aboriginal people in the justice system than will be searching for the location of discriminatory behaviour.",", Background. Like their counterparts in Canada, Aboriginal people in Australia are over-represented in their country’s prisons. In 2001, the Australian imprisonment rate for Aboriginal people was 15 times that for non-Aboriginal populations. In fact, “[m]ost agree that this over-representation [in prison]… is but one manifestation of their general over-representation at every stage of the criminal justice system” (p.65). Two types of explanations have been offered to account for Aboriginal over-representation in prisons: disproportionate criminal activity (rooted, for instance, in economic disadvantage, unemployment or substance abuse) and bias in decision making. Although it would seem safe to assume that discriminatory decisions within the criminal justice system were an important determinant of this phenomenon in the past, its importance as a factor today is less clear., This study looked initially at the arrest rates for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal populations for a selection of relatively serious offences. Aboriginal people were shown to have considerably higher arrest rates (per hundred thousand individuals in the population) than non-Aboriginal people. For instance, their murder rate was 5.7 times as high (9.7 vs. 1.7 per hundred thousand), and their rate for sexual assault was 3.8 times higher. Similarly, Aboriginal robbery levels were 6.1 times higher, and levels for assault occasioning grievous bodily harm were 11.1 times as high as those for non-Aboriginal people., Given that individuals with a prior conviction have a considerably greater likelihood of being incarcerated than those without a criminal history, the records of those being sentenced were examined. For those convicted of a violent offence, Aboriginal offenders were dramatically more likely to have extensive prior convictions for violent offences. Specifically, while 17.9% of Aboriginal offenders convicted of a violent offence had 3 or more prior convictions for violent offences, only 3.7% of non-Aboriginal offenders had the same criminal history. The findings were similar for individuals convicted of theft: in comparison with non-Aboriginal lawbreakers, Aboriginal offenders had a higher probability of having previous convictions for this offence., It has been argued that official data sources may reflect biases within the criminal justice system itself.  Hence, self-report data on offending were also examined. This self-report study of more than 3600 secondary students in New South Wales produced parallel results. Aboriginal adolescents were twice as likely to report committing at least one assault and were five times as likely to report a motor vehicle theft. Similarly, this ethnic minority also disclosed more offending than did non-Aboriginal youths for each of four other offences. Of those who claimed to have been involved in some criminal activity, Aboriginal students were much more likely than non-Aboriginal adolescents to report being high rate offenders (that is, involvement in more than 5 offences in the previous 12 months)., Conclusion., The self-report data are consistent with the arrest information. On both measures, Aboriginal people are considerably more likely to appear to be offenders. Furthermore, of those cases in which the accused is ultimately convicted, Aboriginal offenders have a substantially higher likelihood of having an extensive relevant criminal record. Given these findings, it would appear that even if there were no discriminatory decisions being made with respect to Aboriginal offenders, they would still be over-represented in prisons. Consequently, it would seem that “the scope for reducing rates of Aboriginal imprisonment without reducing Aboriginal offending is… limited” (p.69). Said differently, it would appear that “more progress in reducing Aboriginal rates of imprisonment might be made… if [efforts were concentrated] on the underlying causes of crime in Aboriginal communities” (p.70) such as unemployment rather than on diverting this minority group from the criminal justice system or from simply attempting to identify areas in which they experience discrimination., Reference: Weatherburn, Don; Jackie Fitzgerald and Jiuzhao Hua (2003).

"Police raids on bars in which illegal drug selling apparently was taking place had a relatively brief effect on the suppression of drug dealing in the neighbourhood. In the long term, this intervention was almost completely ineffective.",", Background. Given that crime is not evenly distributed across neighbourhoods within cities, there is a natural interest in identifying strategies that can be used to address problems of illegal activity in high crime areas. In some cities (such as the site of this study - Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), certain bars have sometimes been labelled by police as likely sites of illicit drug selling. A common response by police to such problems is to increase the frequency of raids on these locations. The underlying theory behind this practice is deterrence, based on the idea that certainty of apprehension is considerably more likely than severity of punishment to reduce criminal activity (p.259; See also Criminological Highlights, 6(2), #1)., This study examines the impact of police raids carried out between 1990 and 1992 on establishments that had been identified as “nuisance bars” by the Pittsburgh police narcotics squad. The number of raids as well as the period of time over which they took place varied considerably. The amount of drug dealing was estimated indirectly by using “drug-related 911 calls” in the area immediately surrounding the nuisance bar., The results of this study are complex. First, it was found that enforcement – in the form of raids on these nuisance bars – suppressed drug dealing in the immediate 2 to 3 block radius. That is, within one month of the commencement of a series of drug raids, some reduction in the number of drug calls was apparent. However, this decrease was only temporary in nature. Second, the size of this decrease – assumed to be an indication of reduced drug dealing in the immediate area of the nuisance bar – increased as the amount of enforcement rose. Yet, while this effect continued after the enforcement ended, the suppression of drug dealing only lasted for a few months. Indeed, although “[l]arger reductions in drug calls accompany longer enforcement periods… enforcement effects achieved during an intervention do not persist after treatment is withdrawn” (p.286). An unexpected finding was that the closure of a nuisance bar appeared to increase the amount of visible drug dealing in the area – possibly constituting “further indirect evidence of limits on residual suppression effects after enforcement ceases” (p.279). Both of these outcomes – the relatively short duration of the initial enforcement effects and the negative impact of closing problematic establishments – highlight the importance of looking beyond the short term when evaluating enforcement strategies. Finally, the nature of the areas in which the bars were located was also important. For example, the (temporary) enforcement effects were largest in “low risk” areas (e.g., areas with little vacant land, few bars and a low proportion of commercial properties). However, “even these most responsive enforcement targets… show little evidence of being able to sustain the suppression effects achieved during periods of active police enforcement into post-enforcement periods” (p.290)., Conclusion. Though drug dealing enforcement - in the form of raids on bars in which dealing is thought to be occurring - can reduce drug problems on the streets during the time that the police are active in suppressing it, there is, unfortunately, “little indication that these reductions are sustained after the special enforcement is withdrawn” (p.289). In this light, claims that a crime suppression or deterrence program is successful should be tempered by the knowledge that the success of these programs may be a criminological will-o’-the wisp., Reference: Cohen, Jacqueline; Wilpen Gorr and Piyusha Singh (2003).

Users of cocaine and heroin are considerably more likely to be involved in money-making crimes shortly after they use drugs than during drug-free periods of their lives. This is particularly the case when they are not legally employed and when they are not in a spousal relationship.,", Background.  It is well established that drug users get the money for their drugs - to some extent - through illegal means. However, it is also known that non-trivial amounts of this income come from conventional legal activity (See Criminological Highlights, 5(4), #7). One of the problems with most of the research examining the impact of drug consumption on criminal behaviour is that it is difficult to identify whether drug use is a cause of economic crime or merely a co-existing factor in the same individuals (who, for example, are simply embedded in communities in which acquisitive crimes and drug use are both common)., This study examines changes in illegal earnings over an 18-36 month period in a group of so-called marginalized Americans (i.e. dropouts, drug addicts, and parolees) from nine cities who were involved in an experimental study in the 1970s that examined the impact on crime of being offered a job (see Criminological Highlights, 4 (3), #6). On a monthly basis, the participants were asked about income from all sources as well as drug use and a number of other factors which could be expected to vary over time (such as their employment status and the unemployment rate in their community). One advantage of this “within individual” analytic approach is that effects cannot be attributed to differences in individuals since the analyses look at the changes in drug use within the same participants across time. These “within individual” changes in drug use were subsequently related to alterations (in the next month) in the participant’s sources of income., The results are clear. First, the use of cocaine or heroin raised illegal earnings in the month immediately following drug consumption. (Pharmacologically, cocaine and heroin have substantially different effects on a person, yet their effects on illicit income are the same.) Second, those either working or with some other form of legal earnings in a given month had lower criminal income. Furthermore, when workers were optimistic about the possibility of making money, they were less likely to be involved in illegal income-gathering activities.  Third, the unemployment rate in the offender’s community was also important. More specifically, these marginalized people tended to commit more income-earning crime when the local labour market was depressed. On the other hand, cohabitation with a spouse or partner reduced illegal income., It is equally noteworthy that the impact of drug use on illegal earnings was largest in the month immediately following a period of drug use and decreased in magnitude thereafter. On the other hand, those who had used heroin or cocaine over the longest time showed the strongest effects. This finding is consistent with the fact that those with the most sustained drug habits are also most likely to find that an increased drug dose is necessary to maintain a consistent psychological effect., Conclusion. In sum, “[e]mbeddedness in conventional social relationships, licit and illicit opportunities, and subjective perceptions of risk and rewards all influence criminal earnings…. [There is] strong evidence that drug use is an independent cause of illegal earnings rather than a mere epiphenomenon… Chronic heroin and cocaine use creates a need for money that is analogous to the need for food… (pp. 174-5). As such, these data would suggest that the problem of crime associated with drug use might be more effectively addressed by reducing the demand for drugs and by policies that encourage drug users to “become more embedded in conventional activities” (p.177). Indeed, “[a]s offenders gain more lawful opportunities and become more embedded in work and family relationships, their illegal earnings quickly diminish” (p.179)., Reference: Uggen, Christopher and Melissa Thompson (2003).

Young offenders participating in restorative conferences who appear - according to neutral observers - to be genuinely remorseful were less likely to re-offend than were those rated as not showing regret.,", Background. One of the relatively recent approaches to resolving criminal justice disputes - particularly minor ones involving youths - is the use of various forms of conferences involving offenders and victims. Arguments have been repeatedly made that conferencing should reduce re-offending. However, the data supporting the effectiveness of this strategy are more apparent than real. Even the field experiment in Canberra, Australia – probably considered the best overall study of this recent criminal justice approach - did not find statistically significant effects supporting the conclusion that conferences were more effective than courts in reducing re-offending., This study examines conferences that took place in South Australia in 1998-9.  Forty-three percent of the participants had not had any prior official contact with the police before the incident that led to the conference.  Detailed observations were made by trained observers and additional data were obtained from the various participants involved in the conferences. This combination of qualitative and quantitative information permits a systematic examination of the nature and processes of conferences. For instance, it was found that 62% of offenders “mostly or fully” accepted responsibility for what they had done, 49% were mostly or fully remorseful and 41% spontaneously offered apologies. In addition, the researchers indicated that “there was mutual good will and positive movement between the offender and victim by the end of the conference” in 55% of the cases (p.740). Further, offenders were seen as being actively involved in 78% of the conferences. While there were clearly positive findings overall, it is still noteworthy that this criminal justice approach was not inevitably and unambiguously restorative., With regard to recidivism rates, it is interesting to note that a total of 40% of the participants re-offended (defined as any new official incident to which the police responded) within 8-12 months after their conference. The characteristics of those most likely to re-offend included the following:, Interestingly, all conference observers, police officers, conference coordinators, offenders and victims were asked to predict whether the accused would re-offend. Overall rates of accuracy varied from 46% (for victims) to 65% (police), with victims being the most likely group to over-predict re-offending and offenders being the most likely group to over-predict non-offending., Conclusion. The young offenders most likely to re-offend after participating in conferences seem either to share the same characteristics as those identified by most research as having the strongest association with recidivism (i.e. youth with criminal records) or to have cooperated least with the conference process and goals (i.e. individuals not showing remorse or disagreeing with an outcome). While victims were not optimistic about the effect of conferences on re-offending, over 90% of them were still in favour of continuing to fund this criminal justice initiative with public money. In this light, it could be argued that “evidence of reductions in reoffending may be more salient to policy makers or politicians than to their constituents” (p.757)., Reference: Hayes, Hennessey and Kathleen Daly (2003).

"The killing of 13 people at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado had a negligible impact on the level of fear among U.S. secondary school students.",", Background. In the aftermath of the shooting by two students of 34 people at Columbine High School in 1999 which left 13 dead and 21 others injured, “news accounts proclaimed that students nationwide were markedly more fearful” (p.368) than they had been in the past. In light of the extensive media coverage of the event, it would not be surprising that this media claim were true. Further, in the case that students were, in fact, fearful, it is possible that they would not be able to receive the full benefit of school., This study takes advantage of the fact that the National Crime Victimization Survey in the United States was being carried out at the time of the Columbine shootings. Because of the nature of the design of this comprehensive survey, those interviewed before and after the shootings were, in effect, randomly sampled from the same population and, as such, were equivalent on all dimensions. Approximately two-thirds of the total sample of 8397 high school students were interviewed between January 1999 and 20 April 1999 (the day of the shooting) and the remaining one third between the day of the event and June of the same year. Data from 1995 were used as a “control” group to ensure that any effects found in 1999 could not be plausibly attributed to other factors unrelated to the Columbine tragedy (e.g., the time of the year in which the interview took place)., Students were asked about their fear of victimization, areas of the school that they avoided because of fear of being victimized, and any special security measures that they perceived to be in place to ensure school safety., The results were simple. The pre-Columbine data showed that 81.3% of American high school students who were interviewed were “never” afraid at school. Following the tragedy, this figure dropped only slightly to 77.5%. A similar pattern was also found with the overall findings which combined “never” and “almost never afraid at school.” Specifically, 95.2% of American secondary school students rated themselves as part of this response category prior to the Columbine event compared to 94.3% after the tragedy. Clearly, two conclusions can be drawn from these data.  First, most U.S. high school students feel safe in their schools. Second, the events at Columbine had little impact on their levels of fear. Interestingly, the only security measure that apparently changed - from the students’ reports – following the Columbine incident was an increased likelihood of finding entrance and exit doors at the school locked. Ironically, this alteration would probably have had no impact on the Columbine shootings since they were carried out by students enrolled at the school who, as such, enjoyed unchallenged access to the institution., Conclusion. The fact that the vast majority of U.S. high school students felt safe in their schools both prior to and following the Columbine tragedy “appears to present a paradox because of the incongruence with commonly-held expectations that students’ fear greatly increased after Columbine” (p.380). Nonetheless, this finding is similar to estimates of the effects of other incidents involving extreme violence in the U.S. on those not directly involved (e.g., September 11 or the Oklahoma City bombing). Given that school is, and most youths perceive it to be, a safe place (See, for example, Criminological Highlights, 2(2)#1 and 4(4)#6), we should be wary of spending scarce resources in an effort to make students feel even more protected than they already do., Reference: Addington, Lynn A.

"While community drug treatment programs for people released from prison are not a panacea for crime, they may be effective enough to be justified solely on the basis of reduced incarceration costs in the future.","Background.  It is generally recognized that many prison inmates also have substance abuse problems.  Aside from other negative consequences that may result from addiction, it has been shown (e.g., Criminological Highlights, 6(3) #6) that drug use leads to higher rates of property crime. Unfortunately, drug treatment in prison alone is not likely to be as effective as programs that continue in the community after release. In fact, some research has suggested that well-run therapeutic community programs which focus on reducing the use of illegal drugs as well as antisocial behaviour - while simultaneously developing employment skills and pro-social attitudes and values - appear to lower not only drug use but also recidivism., This study examines the impact of an intensive (6 month) therapeutic community work release program in Delaware. Prisoners re-entering society were randomly assigned to either the standard work release program that existed in the Delaware correctional system or the more intensive therapeutic community work release program for drug-addicted offenders. Several individuals in each group had also received an in-prison addiction program. Additionally, a number of the standard work release inmates received some counseling in other regular, more broadly available programs., The results focused on a “cost effectiveness” measure which looked only at the (relative) treatment costs in comparison to the direct expenditures incurred or avoided by corrections. In an 18-month (547 day) follow-up period, the treatment group spent significantly fewer days in prison than did the comparison group (74 vs. 104 days). Further, several participants within the treatment group also received a 6-month aftercare program (involving group and individual counseling sessions as well as urine testing for drugs). These individuals spent, on average, even fewer days in custody than those in the treatment group who did not receive this aftercare intervention (43 vs. 92 days)., The estimated cost of the therapeutic work release program was US$1937 per offender. As this intervention apparently saved approximately 30 days in prison, the average treatment cost would be roughly US$65 per day compared to an estimated imprisonment cost of US$57. Taken alone, these incarceration expenditures might lead one to conclude that the program was not cost effective. However, a number of factors were not included in the analysis - prosecution costs of those who might have re-offended during the 18-month period, criminal justice costs after 18 months, and additional social benefits (e.g., less drug use, more stable employment, less dependence on the social welfare system). The calculations also assume that there were no treatment costs for the comparison group since it was not possible to estimate them. Moreover, the savings for those who participated in the program as well as the aftercare component were even more favourable: for every US$19 invested in the program plus aftercare, 1 day of incarceration was avoided., Conclusion. This analysis suggests that a carefully implemented, comprehensive and intensive treatment program for drug addicted ex-prisoners can pay for itself solely in terms of reduced subsequent incarceration costs. However, it does not mean that all treatment interventions are “cost effective” (see Criminological Highlights, 1(6) #2). Nevertheless, this study serves as a reminder that despite their limitations, treatment programs may be good investments in reducing future criminal justice costs., Reference: McCollister, Kathryn E.; M.T.

"The difference in the homicide rate for blacks and whites in U.S. cities is better explained by the differences in resources (i.e. income, education, professional jobs) available to the two groups than by their relative level of serious disadvantage (i.e. poverty rate, male joblessness rate, proportion of female-headed families).",", Background. In most U.S. cities, the rate at which black Americans commit homicide exceeds that of whites, with a mean difference between blacks and whites of 37.7 homicides per hundred thousand residents. However, the range across different cities is enormous. More specifically, the difference between black and white rates of lethal violence ranges - in 126 central cities - from –8 to +104 (per hundred thousand residents). These divergences have often been explained in terms of differences in the rates of disadvantage of the two groups – e.g., differences in the proportion of black minus the proportion of white residents below a poverty line or excluded from the labour force. An alternative formulation would be to examine the resources available to each group. For example, one might look at differences between the two populations in terms of household incomes or the proportion of college graduates and individuals employed in professional or managerial positions., This study examines the relative importance of these two indices – disadvantage and resources - for the size of the difference in the rates of homicides for blacks and whites.  Interestingly, the correlation between black-white differences in rates of disadvantage (i.e. poverty rates, female-headed families, and male joblessness) and black-white differences in rates of resources (i.e. median income, college graduates, professional jobs) is moderate, but not overwhelmingly high. For instance, the correlation between the size of the gap in median income and the difference between the proportion of families living below the poverty line is a moderate 0.43, suggesting that although the two measures are correlated, they represent distinct constructs., The results suggest that when certain other characteristics of the cities (e.g., level of segregation and differences in home ownership rates - a proxy measure of community stability) are held constant, the differences in the rates of “disadvantage” do not predict the gap in the homicide rates for blacks and whites. In contrast, the three measures of the difference in overall resources available to the two groups (i.e. median income, proportion of college graduates, proportion of professionals) significantly contribute to an understanding of race differences in homicide offending. In addition, the measures of racial segregation and relative rates of home ownership existing in the community were consistent predictors of the relative rate of homicide., Conclusion. The findings of this study support the conclusion that “race differences in [homicide] are affected by substantial gaps between blacks and whites in community stability” (p.660). Further, “it becomes apparent when the actual racial homicide gap is studied that levels of black and white killing diverge so much because these groups are positioned in such dramatically different ways with respect to the core factors reflecting traditional crime” (p.665). “When racial residential segregation is higher, and whites’ level of home ownership, median income, college graduation, and professional workers exceed those for blacks to a greater degree, the racial gap in lethal violence is wider” (p.664)., Reference: Vélez, María B.; Lauren J.

"In a longitudinal study of delinquent males followed from age 7 to age 70, there were no identifiable groups whose rates of offending did not decline with age.",", Background. The belief that a group of offenders exists whose crime rate does not drop with age is attractive to policy makers. It suggests that criminal activity can be substantially reduced if something were done (e.g., treatment or incapacitation) with such a group that would stop future offending. Within this context, policy makers and “criminal careers” researchers have focused on identifying “the subset of chronic offenders known as serious, violent offenders” (p.558) (See also, Criminological Highlights, 1 (3) #7)., This study followed a sample of 500 boys born between 1924-1931 through to 1996. Originally part of a study carried out by Sheldon and Eleanor Glueck, these boys were subsequently traced until the 1990s by way of various death and (state and federal) offending records. The main focus of this research was to determine whether the age-crime relationship – an increase in crime from childhood into adolescence or early adulthood and a decline thereafter – was consistent across groups of offenders., The results are easy to describe., Conclusion. “The data are firm in signaling that persistent and frequent offending in the adult years is not easily divined from zeroing in on juvenile offenders at risk” (p.577). There is variation in the age at which certain groups of men will peak in their offending rates, but there are no identifiable groups whose level of offending does not drop off with age. “Crime declines with age even for active offenders” (p.585). As such, it was impossible to find a “life-course persistent group [that] can be prospectively or even retrospectively identified based on theoretical risk factors at the individual level in childhood or adolescence” (p.588)., Reference: Sampson, Robert J. and John H.

"When stopped by the police, blacks and Hispanics in the U.S. are more likely than are whites to receive a traffic ticket, be arrested, or be subject to the use of force.  However, they are not more likely to be carrying contraband.",", Background. “The practice of targeting racial minorities for routine traffic and pedestrian stops [in the U.S.] can be traced back to the war on drugs, which promoted profiling as an effective policing tactic to detect drug offenders” (p.50). At the height of this American era, “drug arrest rates were five times higher for blacks than for whites despite consistent evidence… of similar rates of drug usage by the two racial groups…” (p.52). Indeed, these types of findings have challenged the notion defended by profiling advocates that “it is reasonable and efficient for police to consider race in their decision making [on whom to stop]” (p.54). However, in order to conclude that the over-representation of black citizens among those stopped does not, in fact, constitute efficient policing, it is necessary to know the “hit rate” on these stops – the proportion of searches which produce contraband. The research on this issue is mixed, with 8 of 16 published studies showing higher “hit rates” for black and/or Hispanic citizens than for whites. Unfortunately, these studies have typically been carried out in single cities or states. As such, it is not known the extent to which the findings may be generalized., This study used data from a national survey of U.S. residents. Overall, black drivers were somewhat more likely than whites to have been stopped in the previous year. Further, blacks who were stopped also had a higher probability than white drivers of being given a ticket, searched, arrested, and subject to the use of force by the police (including the use of handcuffs). This relationship held even after the researchers statistically controlled for various characteristics of the driver (e.g., age, income), the stop (e.g., its stated purpose - an impaired driving assessment, traffic offence, vehicle defect) and the community (e.g., the location in which the stop took place - the centre of a large city, a non-central area)., More importantly, although blacks and Hispanics who were stopped were more likely to be subject to various police actions, “contraband was discovered on fewer minority drivers than on white drivers…. [Specifically,] 16% of the Caucasian drivers who were searched were found to be in possession of contraband, compared to only 7.5% of non-Caucasian drivers…” (p.76). Clearly, these findings are “[c]ontrary to the argument made by many law enforcement officials that minorities are more likely to be carrying drugs and/or weapons” (p.76)., Conclusion. The two major findings of this study – that blacks and Hispanics who are stopped are more likely to be subject to police actions but less likely to be found to be involved in any criminal wrongdoing – suggest that “targeting drivers solely or even partially on the basis of their race/ethnicity is not an effective, efficient, or responsible policing strategy at the national level [in the U.S.]” (p.82). It would certainly seem that it is not the drivers but the practice of racial profiling that needs to be stopped., Reference: Engel, Robin Shepard and Jennifer M. Calnon (2004).

Employment for young adults reduces crime largely because previously delinquent youths not only come into contact with prosocial peers in the context of their job but also stop associating with those who supported their delinquent activities.,", Background. Various life events – such as employment or marriage – appear to be related to reductions in criminal behaviour among young adults. There are at least two possible explanations for the effect of these changes. First, they may be associated with “an extensive set of obligations, expectations, and interdependent networks that can facilitate social control” (p.184). Alternatively, “prosocial work relations may restructure friendship networks by diminishing contact with delinquent peers” (p.185). More specifically, “entrance into a job introduces an employee to a new set of peers… [and the] quality and content of the relationships that occur between coworkers, not necessarily with an employer or the institution of work, may determine [the impact on crime]” (p.187). This latter explanation would be consistent with findings demonstrating that employment is often associated with an increased risk of offending for adolescents as youth coworkers are, themselves, not frequently committed to conventional values., This study used data from the U.S. National Youth Survey. In addition to various measures of the youth’s commitment to work, the survey included a measure of the respondent’s assessment of the degree of disapproval that would be felt by his/her coworkers upon discovering that he/she was engaging in any criminal behaviour. The main dependent variable was a self-report measure of offending. Youths were interviewed when they were 15-21 years old and again three years later when they were young adults (ages 18-24). When the researchers controlled for the level of offending at the first interview, they found that having “prosocial co-workers” and having a long period of stable employment were associated with lower levels of involvement in crime. Similar results were found with respect to drug use. More specifically, reduced rates of drug use were shown to be related to having prosocial coworkers, and especially, having stable employment with prosocial coworkers., Conclusion. Contrary to the view “that employment builds informal social control by establishing [successful association] with employers” (p.198), these results suggest that “employment may set in motion a process that reduces offending by affecting peer networks” (p.198). For these young adults, stable employment - on its own - was associated with reduced levels of criminal activity. However, the presence of prosocial coworkers was also directly related to lower rates of offending and drug use. Therefore, it would appear that employment alone may not be a central factor in the reduction of crime as much as is employment in settings in which coworkers are not likely to be involved in, or approve of, crime., Reference: Wright, John Paul, and Francis T. Cullen (2004).

"Peer networks, marriage and other significant life events only partially explain a reduction in crime among those who were serious offenders in their youth. The impact of these factors also depends on the ways in which these changes fit into an individual’s views of the kind of person that he/she wants to be.",", Background. It is well established that most young offenders cease criminal activity in early adulthood. Research on this “desistance” process has often suggested that marriage as well as other significant life events are important factors in explaining this reduction in offending. Similarly, the act of turning away from delinquent friends has also been found to be associated with diminished criminal behaviour. However, it may equally be that marriage and peer relations are linked whereby marriage may be important in understanding changes in friendship relationships which, in turn, affect offending. The difficulty with such structural analyses is that they do not take into account the manner in which people alter their views of themselves, particularly in terms of their identity as a ‘non-offender’. Indeed, one’s choices of partners and friends may reflect – rather than cause – changing perspectives of oneself., This paper reports the results of a longitudinal study of men and women initially interviewed when they were incarcerated as young delinquents in Ohio. Thirteen years later, 85% of them were located (both in and out of prison) and were asked questions about the nature of their lives in the intervening period. Detailed information was collected – and verified against official sources when possible - on respondents’ levels of criminal involvement as well as those of their friends and spouses. Additional questions were also asked about their peer networks –those people with whom they spent time and the degree of influence that these individuals had on them., Within this sample of (originally) serious delinquents, marriage per se was not significantly related to the level of criminal involvement of their friends. Rather, the more relevant factor seemed to be whether their spouses supported or discouraged criminal activity. Indeed, the level of offending of the respondent’s spouse was a relatively strong predictor of his/her own level of criminal involvement. Compared to their responses when they had been adolescents, people also indicated that peers influenced them less as adults. Further, people in adulthood tended to make conscious decisions about the type of friends that they wanted to have. Some participants claimed that they actively avoided people whom they knew were likely to commit offences while others maintained relationships with delinquent friends but were able to avoid engaging in crime because of perceptions about their own identity as non-offenders. Clearly, the life choices that people were making about friendships – more than attachment to one’s spouse or job stability – appeared to be important in predicting adult offending., Not surprisingly, women showed lower levels of involvement in crime than did men at the time of the follow-up interview. However, this difference can be explained by the fact that male respondents’ friends tended to have higher levels of criminal activity. In addition, women seemed to be less influenced than men by the illicit behaviour of their spouse or friends., Conclusions: This paper suggests that it may be worthwhile to rethink our assumption that certain life course events - such as marriage - are likely to have automatic effects on the probability that a person will cease to offend. The manner in which these events are interpreted appears to be crucial in understanding their effect on crime. Similarly, the impact of associations with previously delinquent peers can and does change over time - people become less influenced by the misbehaviour of those with whom they associate. As such, conditions imposed on offenders that prohibit contact with prior offenders should be considered in light of the somewhat complex manner in which these friendships are related to criminal behaviour., Reference: Giordano, Peggy C.; Stephen A.

"When given the opportunity to impose sentences that were explicitly longer than would be considered proportionate to the gravity of the offence, judges in Victoria, Australia largely declined to do so, despite the popularity of these provisions with the public and politicians.",", Background.  Previous research in England on the use of dangerous offender legislation by judges has suggested that “there was a judicial reluctance to apply the full force of provisions such as longer than commensurate sentences and automatic life sentences” (p.82). Generally speaking, “proportionality has been regarded as a fundamental tenet of the common law by the High Court of Australia” (p.82).  Nevertheless, the Victoria (state) government introduced legislation in 1993 that required the court “to regard protection of the community as the principal purpose for which the sentence is imposed”. In addition, it was stipulated that “in order to achieve this purpose, the court may impose a custodial sentence ‘longer than that which is proportionate to the gravity of the offence considered in light of its objective circumstances’”(p.83). It was further permitted that anyone over age 21 and found guilty of one or more of 50 “serious” offences could be sentenced to an indefinite term of imprisonment, notwithstanding the fact that other maximum sentence lengths would normally apply. Clearly, this legislation was a threat to the principle of proportionality in sentencing., Systematic examination of the effect of legislation such as this one has detected “a juridical tradition… which is generally resistant to such policies” (p.85). For instance, judges will limit the application of these laws to exceptional cases. Similarly, they will interpret the legislation in such a way as to restrict its use. In this study, researchers examined 553 cases appearing before the court between 1994 and 2002 in which the application of these special provisions was considered.  These cases largely involved serious sexual offences whose rate of guilty pleas was lower than that for the court as a whole., The experience in the courts in Victoria suggests that indefinite sentences are not imposed even when they could be. In fact, only 4 of these 553 cases resulted in such a sanction, and in only 11 additional cases were sentences handed down that were longer than proportionate, as allowed by this law. Only 5 of these sentences were upheld after appeal and all were for serious sexual offenses. Further, in those cases in which a disproportionate sentence was not imposed, judges typically indicated that a proportionate sentence would provide sufficient protection to the public. Interestingly, this judicial resistance to indefinite sentences appears to have also influenced prosecutors who have made relatively few applications for this type of sanction., Conclusions. “Judicial ownership of sentencing and the fierce way in which judicial discretion is defended by the judiciary may go part of the way to explain the reasons for why judges employ avoidance tactics so as not to apply provisions they do not agree with. But such reluctance may also be due to their recognition that the sentences that they are urged to impose will not protect the community, regardless of prevailing popular opinion” (p.98)., Reference:  Richardson, Elizabeth and Arie Freiberg (2004).

"Why does the U.S. imprison so many people?  Cycles of crime, sensibilities about criminal activity, moral panics, and governmental structures that allowed unthinking and unthinkable “tough on crime” policies to flourish coincided to create strategies whose purpose was to increase levels of imprisonment.",", Background. American imprisonment rates are exceptional. In the 1930s, they were comparable or lower than those of many European countries. Even until the 1970s (when the U.S. rate was approximately 144 per 100,000 residents), the difference between the U.S. and elsewhere was not substantial. In contrast, the current level of incarceration in America (700 per 100,000 residents) is dramatically higher than that in any western country. In explaining this phenomenon, it is easy to see what does not account for it:, Several alternative explanations are offered for the high rates of imprisonment in the U.S. today. First, the state bureaucratic apparatus - including the judiciary - is relatively powerful and autonomous in much of Europe and less subject to political pressures. Second, it is suggested that general crime policies – like those specifically related to drugs – have emerged as a response to a cultural climate in which any approach which was not (perceived as) punitive in nature was rejected because it was seen as ‘soft on crime’. For instance, drug use became associated with the poor and minorities in the public’s mind during the period in which drug issues were salient in the U.S.. Hence, drugs were consequently seen as being dangerous and/or evil, rendering punitive drug policies easy to exploit politically. As a result, although (drug) crime rates had already begun to reverse, repressive strategies were still implemented as the most ‘viable’ political response. Finally, the recent increase in the U.S. crime rate (1960-1990) occurred within a context of a much longer overall decline. This increase coincided with a series of short-term moral panics in the U.S. during which “problems are exaggerated, public attitudes are polarized, traditional values of moderation and balance are cast aside, moral entrepreneurs become influential, and extreme policies are adopted” (p.98). Not surprisingly, cultural sensitivities changed, with people becoming less sympathetic to the offender and more moralistic and judgmental about wrongful behaviour., Conclusion. In the past 30 years, “cycles, sensibilities, and moral panics coincided in ways that produced current crime control and penal policies. Crime rates rose… the world changed… [and] these things raised fears and anxieties that were in part displaced to people (criminals) and things (crime and disorder) that were ready objects of hatred and derision” (p.138)., Reference: Tonry, Michael (2004).

"The more firearms there are in a community, the more likely it is that high school students in that community will carry them.","Background. “When it comes to gun policy, one of the few uncontroversial assertions is that unsupervised adolescents should not carry them in public” (p. 27).  Two broad approaches have been used to limit the use of firearms by adolescents: reducing demand (the motivation to carry or use a firearm) and reducing supply (the availability of guns).   Some prominent scholars have suggested, however, that criminal gun use by teens is not affected by supply because those who want a gun can always find one. This “futility hypothesis” would suggest, then, that “restrictions on gun markets do not reduce the misuse of guns” (p. 28). Consistent with the “futility hypothesis” is the finding that many youths report that it is easy for them to find (illegal) guns., This study, using a national survey of adolescent males carried out in 1995, examines gun-carrying among 15-17 year olds, 10% of whom report having carried a gun at least once in the month prior to the survey.  Typically, teens who report having carried a gun indicated that they did so to protect themselves., Gun ownership rates vary enormously in the United States.  The estimated rates of ownership of guns in households in Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi (over 55%) are more than 4 times those of Hawaii and Massachusetts (about 12%).  In this study, local gun prevalence was estimated by using a measure that has been shown to have a very strong relationship to the rate of gun ownership in a community: the proportion of all suicides committed with guns.  The basic analysis, then, looks at the relationship between this measure of gun ownership and reported gun carrying by adolescents.   Various other factors were statistically held constant –   crime rate in the community, socio-economic status, age and race of the youth, whether the youth lived in an urban area, as well as measures of neighbourhood disadvantage.  The most notable finding is that “controlling for individual characteristics, the likelihood of gun carrying is positively related to gun prevalence in the county, and strongly so” (p. 40).   The findings suggest that “a 50% increase in county gun ownership is associated with approximately a doubling of the prevalence of teen gun carrying” (p. 41)., It could be argued, however, that places where guns are prevalent are simply more dangerous, and, therefore, youths are more likely to arm themselves for self-defence purposes.  Two facts argue against this as an alternative explanation for these findings. First, the violent crime rate was controlled for (using robbery rate as a proxy for violent crime).  More persuasive was the finding that “Gun prevalence has little effect on the likelihood that the teen carries any type of weapon, either a gun, knife, or something else…. While [gun prevalence]  does not affect the likelihood that a teen carries a weapon, the availability of guns clearly increases the likelihood that those teens who do carry weapons choose guns” (p. 41)., Conclusion:  It appears that the “futility hypothesis” is not confirmed: There is value in trying to reduce the availability of guns, since it appears to relate to the likelihood that teenagers will carry a gun.  “Where guns are prevalent, adolescents will find it easier to borrow or steal or buy them from family members or other people” (p. 49).  “Supply-side interventions [do not appear to be] inherently “futile” and should not be ruled out a priori by policymakers” (p. 50)., Reference:  Cook, Philip J. and Jens Ludwig (2004).

Policies relating to support for pregnant women and young children can reduce the likelihood of anti-social behaviour.,", Background.  There are data suggesting that physical aggression in children peaks at age 2 and declines thereafter. “This is an indication that most humans learn to control the use of physically aggressive behaviour before they enter the school system… Those who have not learned to control their aggressive reactions by the time they enter the school system enter a vicious circle of negative interactions, where rejection from their peers, because of their aggressive behaviour, leads to more reasons for aggression” (p. 207).  Hence intervention (prevention) programs during early childhood would appear to stand a good chance of having a substantial impact on future aggression., This paper reviews a number of different interventions in which delinquency or socially disruptive behaviour was typically the outcome variable.  Most of the studies involved randomized control design and had follow-up periods (after the intervention) of at least a year.  Some of the studies used delinquency as the outcome measure; others used measures that have been shown to be related to delinquency (e.g., the prevention of inadequate parenting). Some of the positive outcomes that have been found include the following:, In all, 28 studies are reviewed in this paper.  As a whole, the review demonstrates that “interventions with high-risk families can change the parenting behaviour which many theories identify as the first stop in a chain of events that can lead to anti-social behaviour” (p. 233)., Conclusion. “The review of the 28 prevention experiments [suggests] that early childhood interventions can have a positive impact on the three most important risk factors for juvenile delinquency: disruptive behaviour, cognitive skills, and parenting.  Furthermore, experiments with long-term follow-ups which have targeted at least two of these risk factors in childhood have shown a significant impact on criminal behaviour. From these results, it can be concluded that early and intensive preventive interventions can have the desirable impact which appears to be so difficult to achieve with disruptive elementary school children and juvenile delinquents” (p. 237)., Reference: Tremblay, Richard E. and Christa Japel.

Contact with the formal juvenile justice system increases the level of criminal activity in early adulthood.,", Background. The labelling perspective suggests that contact with the justice system increases the likelihood of further delinquency.  One explanation for this effect is that formal contact with the justice system has a “negative impact on conventional opportunities… and leads to cumulative disadvantage in future life chances…” (p. 1288)., This study followed a sample of Rochester, New York, youths through adolescence until they were 21-22 years old. Youths were asked if they had been arrested or had other contact with the police and whether they had experienced other, more formal, juvenile justice intervention.  When the youths were young adults,  self-report offending records were obtained on seven relatively serious offences (e.g., robbery, attacks with a weapon, break and enter, car thefts) as well as the youth’s involvement in drug sales., The results demonstrated that a youth’s likelihood of graduating from high school was lowered as a result of police or juvenile justice involvement even after controlling statistically for previous offending, parental poverty, and school ability (at age 12). A separate analysis found that “experiencing official [criminal justice] intervention in adolescence is significantly associated with reduced odds in favour of staying in school in a subsequent period” (p. 1301).    An analysis of self-reported criminal activity at age 19-20 demonstrated that police or juvenile justice intervention earlier in adolescence was associated with increased criminal behaviour in early adulthood.  The effect of police or juvenile justice intervention  “has stronger crime amplification effects among the disadvantaged [African American youths living in poverty]” (p. 1306).  The effects of juvenile justice interventions on drug selling were quite similar: police or juvenile justice intervention increased the likelihood of drug selling at age 19-20.  And again, “the effect of juvenile justice intervention on drug selling is stronger among those from impoverished family backgrounds” (p. 1306)., Looking at criminal involvement at age 21-22, it appears that an earlier intervention by the police increases crime rates generally through its effect of decreasing the likelihood of graduating from high school and increasing the likelihood of unemployment at age 19-21.  Juvenile justice intervention appears to have a direct effect in increasing drug selling and general crime at age 21-22, but also has an indirect effect by way of decreasing the likelihood of graduating from high school which, in turn, increases the likelihood of unemployment at age 19-21., Conclusion.  It appears that police or juvenile justice intervention with young people has a reasonable likelihood of increasing the probability that the youth will, as a young adult, be involved in crime and/or drug selling.  Generally speaking, these negative impacts on youths are more likely for those who come from impoverished backgrounds or are black.  The argument, therefore, that it is important to apprehend and prosecute young people in order to hold them accountable for their actions should  be questioned.  These data suggest that for many youths – especially those from impoverished backgrounds – the best strategy may be to do as little as possible and wait for them to outgrow their criminal behaviour., Reference:  Bernburg, Jön Gunnar and Marvin D.

"Why does Japan have low rates of violent crime?  Variation in Japanese rates of violence in the second half of the 20th century is associated with factors such as economic conditions that are known, in western cultures, to relate to crime rates. Cultural characteristics unique to Japan that are related to informal social controls do not seem to be very important.",", Background.  Impressed with the obvious cultural differences between Japan and western countries, many commentators have suggested that Japan’s low and generally decreasing crime rate is due to such factors as the manner in which Japanese social organizations (e.g., family, workplace, schools) highly value interdependency and thus achieve informal social control.   The only problem with this explanation is that while crime rates dropped between 1950 and 2000, “family and community ties, the supposed root of informal social control in Japan, have weakened…” (p. 181).  Divorce rates, the number of women in the work force, and urbanization have all increased dramatically in Japan during this period., This study examines Japanese homicide and robbery rates as a function of divorce, urbanization, females in the work force,  as well as traditional determinants of crime rates in the west: economic stress (income inequality, unemployment, and poverty),  the likelihood of apprehension for crime (as reflected in police clearance rate), and the proportion of young males in the population., The results suggest that violent crime in Japan is controlled in large part by economic factors: higher homicide and robbery rates during this period are associated with periods of higher income inequality, higher unemployment and poverty as well as with low apprehension rates and higher proportions of young males in the population.   One of the measures of informal social control (female labour force participation) was associated with the robbery rate, but not with the homicide rate.  A separate analysis, looking at individual areas of Japan across this same period had similar findings: changes in divorce rates, urbanization, or that proportion of women in the work force had no consistent impact on crime., Conclusion. “The results indicate that a comprehensive explanation for Japanese crime rates should include measures of economic stress, age structure and certainty of punishment.  The findings also suggest that social disorganization explanations, closely linked to the idea that Japan’s crime rates are due to its unique cultural characteristics, should not be overemphasized in accounts of Japanese crime trends” (p. 200-1).  These findings might be seen as suggesting that it is possible for other countries to follow the Japanese example and achieve relatively low rates of violence: “Other countries probably cannot reproduce Japan’s cultural milieu, but they may be able to create more favourable economic trends” (p. 201).  Nevertheless, for Japan, the economic changes that are taking place (e.g., the end of guaranteed lifetime employment) “threaten to substantially increase these [crime] rates” (p. 201)., Reference: Roberts, Aki and Gary LaFree (2004).  Explaining Japan’s Postwar Violent Crime Trends.  Criminology, 42(1), 179-209., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV6N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-6-no-5-%E2%80%93-august-2004,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 6, No. 5 – August 2004",Regular Issue,2004
A study of women felony offenders in the U.S. shows that a standard indicator of risk – the Revised Level of Service Inventory (LSI-R) – does not add to one’s ability to predict rearrest or supervision violations of women on probation or parole once the financial status of the woman is taken into consideration.,", Background.  What factors predict a woman’s risk of recidivism?  A commonly used instrument, the LSI-R (Level of Service Inventory-Revised) has been used with some success in order to predict the recidivism of men.  It is said to be an effective measure of “comprehensive risk and criminogenic needs” (p. 189) and was developed “to assist correctional administrators in distributing scarce resources across offenders based on a combination of recidivism risk and need for services” (p. 189).  However, there has been some dispute about the measure’s usefulness with respect to women, based in part on ideas concerning the “gendered nature of offending [suggesting that ] female pathways to crime are different from those of their male counterparts” (p. 187).  In particular it is argued that “the influence of poverty on recidivism among women offenders” (p. 187) has not been given sufficient attention., This paper looks at the recidivism risk of 134 female felony offenders on probation or parole in Minnesota.  Two dependent measures were examined: rearrest for any offence and reports by the women as to whether they had violated conditions of probation or parole.  The LSI-R had been administered to the women.  In addition, the woman’s financial status was assessed., The results show quite clearly that the LSI-R is related to both rearrest and parole or probation violations.  In a similar fashion, whether or not the woman was living in the community in poverty also predicted rearrest and parole or probation violations.  What is most interesting, however, is that above and beyond the woman’s poverty status, the LSI-R added nothing to the overall predictability of these two measures of recidivism., Looking only at those women whose income put them below the “poverty line,” it was found that two forms of state-supported help  – publicly subsidized housing and life skills programming  which included “assistance in areas such as identifying potential employers, filling out job applications and developing interview skills” (p. 200) – significantly reduced the likelihood of the woman being rearrested and/or violating probation or parole conditions.  Those women living in poverty without such assistance were three times more likely to recidivate than were those who did receive assistance (45% vs. 14%).  Looking only at those women living in poverty, receiving state support reduced recidivism, but the LSI-R score did not  help predict recidivism once the receipt of state aid was taken into account., Conclusion. It would seem that the most commonly used measure of  “risk” of recidivism (LSI-R) does not help predict recidivism above and beyond a woman’s economic status.  More importantly, however, the study focuses attention on the importance of the economic well-being of women serving sentences in the community and the importance of  “state-sponsored assistance to meet critical short-term economic needs” (p.202) of these women.  Investments by the state in reducing poverty (directly or indirectly through employment assistance programs or housing) appear to be good investments in reducing recidivism as well as improving the lives of an impoverished group., Reference.

Police officers who reject the traditional norms of the “police culture” are less likely than police who hold traditional police attitudes to use coercive behaviour in their interactions with citizens.,", Background.  “Police culture” is usually defined in terms of a number of quite separate attitudinal clusters:  the view that citizens are not to be trusted; that citizens would not support them if help were needed; that police supervisors are more interested in procedural rules and regulations than in the officers’ well-being; and that procedural rules (e.g., relating to search and seizure) sometimes need to be broken., This study examines the relationship between the strength of a police officer’s adherence to traditional police culture and the officer’s use of coercive techniques in their interaction with citizens.   A total of 638 police officers in Indianapolis, Indiana and St. Petersburg, Florida were interviewed.  Each officer was also observed during 12 separate shifts in areas where police citizen interactions were thought to be most frequent.  The analysis of the officers’ style of interaction with citizens is based on encounters with 3223 citizens whom the police identified as suspects (wrongdoers, peace disturbers or people who had been the subject of a citizen complaint).   Police officers were classified as adhering to traditional police culture on the basis of an analysis of clusters of attitudes.  Generally speaking, for example, if they tended to distrust citizens, hold negative views of supervisors and police management, endorse the view that sometimes rules had to be broken and that patrols should be carried out aggressively, they would be classified as endorsing a traditional police culture., In the observed encounters between police and citizens, use of force was scaled from none, through verbal commands or threats, to physical constraints (e. g. pat downs and handcuffing) through “impact methods (pain compliance techniques…)” (p. 1019).   Generally speaking, pro-police culture officers used each type of force more often than did those officers who did not endorse police culture.  In order to control for other (legal) determinants of the use of force, independent observers recorded whether the suspect showed resistance, the strength of the evidence against the accused, whether the suspect was subsequently arrested, whether the citizen showed disrespect to the police, as well as other factors that might explain the use of force by the police officer (e.g., whether the suspect showed evidence of the effects of drugs or alcohol)., Results.  While many of these control variables (e.g., whether the suspect resisted the police officer, the race and gender of the suspect) had effects on the use of force by the police officer, above and beyond these “control” factors, the use of force was positively associated with the officers’ adherence to traditional police culture.  “Pro [traditional police] culture officers in both cities were significantly more likely to use force compared with the [anti-police] culture group…” (p. 1026)., Conclusion. It is clear that those officers who endorse what might be called the “police culture” are more likely to use force (verbal and physical) in their interactions with citizens.  On the other hand, it was clear in these two U.S. police forces that a substantial number of officers did not hold these views.  The notion of a “universally shared police culture [may, therefore,] have been overstated by police scholars” (p. 1030)., Reference: Terrill, William, Eugene A.

"There is not a simple relationship among adolescents between working and deviance (e.g., alcohol use, arrest for a crime).  The effect of working on deviance depends on the nature of the job: some jobs increase involvement in crime; others decrease criminal involvement.",", Background. The relationship between work and crime appears, to some extent, to be age related. “Although even marginal employment reduces the likelihood of adult crime, working more than 20 hours per week appears to increase delinquency and problem behaviours for adolescents” (p. 264).  Previous research has suggested that the peers one encounters at work may affect delinquency levels (see, for example, Criminological Highlights, 6(4)#5).  However, little research has been done on the impact of different kinds of work on delinquency., This paper analyzed data from a longitudinal study in Minnesota in order to try to understand the impact of work on three measures of adolescent deviance during the final year of high school: breaking school rules, alcohol use, and arrests.  The work characteristics that were examined were wages, whether youths viewed their jobs as giving them higher status among their friends, whether youths felt that their jobs provided learning opportunities, whether the youth was highly supervised at work, work stress, and whether youths thought that their jobs increased, decreased, or did not affect their school marks., The results showed that various work characteristics did have impacts on the various measures of deviance.  For example, looking at arrests in Grade 12, those youths who thought that their work reduced their grades in school were more likely to report being arrested than were those youths who reported that they had a great deal of autonomy in the work place.  Alcohol use in Grade 12 was associated with longer work hours, a belief that the job did not provide useful skills, more autonomy in the workplace, a belief that the work was interfering with grades, and the belief that the work enhanced one’s reputation with peers.  Misbehaviour in school was most common among youths who were involved in long hours of work, who saw work as interfering with their grades, and whose work provided a great deal of autonomy in the workplace., Clearly it is not simply the number of hours that is important in understanding the impact of adolescent work on deviance.  Certain characteristics of the work environment are important in understanding whether it will increase, decrease, or not affect adolescent deviance.  But in addition, there are “certain dimensions of adolescent employment [that appear] to exacerbate the “harmful” effects of long hours on adolescent delinquency” (p. 280).  Although long hours of work (e.g., more than 20 hours per week) generally appear to increase deviance in high school students, long hours of work that helped the students’ grades appears to decrease use of alcohol in Grade 12., Conclusion. “Job conditions are likely to exert very different effects in adolescence and adulthood.  To reduce delinquency, ‘good jobs’ in adolescence must support rather than displace academic roles and offer genuine opportunities to learn something useful.  Such jobs should also provide extensive controls, with circumscribed levels of autonomy, wages, and status among peers” (p. 283).  “Work experiences that are expected to decrease arrest, recidivism, and substance use in adults…. actually increase delinquency in adolescence” (p. 284)., Reference: Staff, Jeremy and Christopher Uggen.  The Fruits of Good Work: Early Work Experiences and Adolescent Deviance (2003).  Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency, 40 (3), 263-290., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV6N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-6-no-5-%E2%80%93-august-2004,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 6, No. 5 – August 2004",Regular Issue,2004
"Not all women victims of spousal assault want the police to arrest the man who attacked them.  Generally speaking, disadvantaged women who have been victims of more severe violence are more likely to want the police to arrest the man who attacked them.",", Background.  It is now reasonably well established that a large proportion of women victims of spousal assault do not call the police when they are assaulted. Furthermore, of those women who do call the police, only a portion want the police to charge and prosecute “their” offender (See, for example, Criminological Highlights, 3(2)#8 and 3(5)#6).  Instead, they may have called the police for other reasons – e.g., to get their attacker to stop. “Whether it is desirable to remove all victim input from decision making [on filing and dropping charges] is a subject of dispute” (p. 316).  However, it is reasonably clear that arresting the offender cannot be counted on to have a deterrent impact on his future behaviour., This study examines the views of 419 women in Charlotte, North Carolina, who were cohabiting with a male and had been assaulted by him.  In all cases, the police had been called in to deal with what was deemed to be a misdemeanour spousal assault.  Some days after the incident in which the police had been called, the woman was interviewed.  The women tended to be poor and black. About half were married and half were cohabiting., The results are consistent with previous studies: only about 30% indicated that they wanted their offender to be arrested.  Most wanted him taken away or warned.  A victim’s desire to have the offender arrested was associated with the victim being poor and black, having been assaulted many times by him in the previous 6 months, living with an offender who had previously been arrested, and being the victim of a more severe attack.  In other words, women who had been attacked more severely or who had been attacked by someone with a longer history of violence were more likely to want him to be charged., Previous research has shown that victims are just as good as actuarial methods in predicting future offending in circumstances such as these (Criminological Highlights, 3(2)#7).  Consistent with this finding is the fact that women in this study who wanted their offender to be arrested were more likely to be re-victimized than were victims who did not want arrests to be made.  Seven different measures of “re-victimization” were examined (e.g., a subsequent threat to the victim or her family, a subsequent attack on the victim or her family, etc.).  A fairly consistent predictor of re-offending was the number of times the victim had been previously hit.  Hence it is not surprising that it was these cases in which women were most likely to want “their” offender to be arrested., Conclusion. As with previous studies on this topic, it appears that a woman’s views on what should happen to the man who victimized her in domestic assault cases are not random.  Instead, such decisions appear to be predictably related to the facts of the case.  It can be argued that these data “support the argument that officials should pay attention to the preferences of victims of domestic violence when deciding whether to effect an arrest… Victims may possess knowledge that is of importance in predicting future danger” (p. 332)., Reference: Hershel, David and Ira W.

"“Since the 1970s, U.S. criminal victimization has become markedly more concentrated in the poorest economic groups, as the overall drop in crime since 1974 has benefited upper-income households much more than it has benefited the poor” (p. 89-90).","Background.  The National Crime Victimization Survey in the U.S. has been collecting information about individual and household victimizations since 1974.  This study looks at those data (between 1974 and 2000), focusing primarily on violent crimes (assaults, robberies and rapes).  Generally speaking it has been well established in the U.S. that violent crimes tend to be concentrated among the poor, whereas household thefts and motor vehicle thefts tend to be crimes disproportionately experienced by the wealthy (in part, of course, because the poor are less likely to have goods worth stealing).  The study focuses on the ‘20-20’ ratio – the victimization rate of people in the poorest 20% of households in the U.S., divided by the victimization rate of people in the wealthiest 20% of households in the U.S. As this number increases, the concentration of crime among the poor increases., The findings demonstrate that violent crime has become more concentrated within the poorest part of American society.  “For violent crimes, the 20-20 ratio grew from 1.15 [the victimization rate for poor people was slightly higher than the rate for rich people] during the 1974-1980 period to 1.76 in the 1994-2000 period (a 53% increase)” (p. 95-6). This finding was consistent across various indices of the inequality of violent victimization rates. For burglary there were similarly consistent results, though the pattern for thefts (household and motor vehicle) was less consistent across measures., When one looks at serious violent crimes (rape, robbery, aggravated assault), the 20-20 ratio increased from 1.59 to 2.54 across this same 20 year period.   An analysis of the actual rates of victimization for rich and poor Americans shows that during the period of decline in rates of violence in the U.S., the increased inequality in rates of violent victimization is the result of “especially large drops in victimization among the wealthy” (p. 102). In addition, violent victimization inequality grew most dramatically for violent crimes where the victim knew the offender., During the latter part of the 20th century, there were demographic changes amongst the poorest and richest groups of Americans that appear to account for part of this change. Two-thirds of the growth in inequality of victimization for violent crimes (p. 112) can be accounted for by demographic changes. During this period the richest group became relatively older (compared to changes in the poorest group), more likely to be married, and more likely to be working and living in a suburban setting.  Each of these characteristics of the wealthy is associated with being relatively less likely to be victimized., Conclusion. “The decline in crime that the U.S. has experienced over the past 3 decades has not been shared equally: The wealthy have enjoyed the benefits of this decline much more than the poor have” (p. 109).  “For the most serious violent crimes, the disparity between rich and poor has become quite large” (p. 110)., Reference: Thacher, David (2003) The Rich Get Richer and the Poor Get Robbed: Inequality in U.S. Criminal Victimization, 1974-2000.  Journal of Quantitative Criminology, 20, 89-116., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV6N6_0.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-6-no-6-%E2%80%93-october-2004,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 6, No. 6 – October 2004",Regular Issue,2004
"Advocates of restorative justice (RJ) have created at least four myths about the origin and nature of RJ practices in the criminal justice system.   In the long run, RJ approaches may have a better chance of surviving if they are grounded in reality rather than myth even though the myths may, initially,  help sell the approach.",", strong mythological beliefs about the approach.   These myths include unsubstantiated claims that, in the long run, may well bring all restorative attempts in criminal justice into disrepute.

U.S. courts have used different rules to interpret ‘requests’ by the police to carry out a ‘voluntary’ search of a suspect and ‘requests’ from suspects who want to speak to a lawyer.,", Background.  How should the following be interpreted?, Linguistic theory would suggest that courts have used “selective literalism” (p. 231) in interpreting the language of police and accused people. The difficulty in separating commands from requests is that for reasons of politeness, we often make requests and commands indirectly.  Nobody thinks that the words, “Could you pass the salt?” is a request for information about the ability of the listener to pass the salt.  Yet the meaning of “Don’t you think it would be a good idea to shine those shoes?” (p. 236) depends completely on whether the statement comes from a sergeant in the army who is inspecting his troops or a friend talking to someone who is about to go to a job interview.  The sergeant inspecting his troops is not asking a question; he is giving a command. “No” is almost certainly not an acceptable answer in this context.  The friend may be either asking a question or giving advice.   And when the police officer asks “Can I have a look in your trunk?” (p. 237) it seems likely that the officer isn’t asking the driver whether the driver thinks the officer has the ability to look in the trunk.  Similarly, when a police officer asks a suspect if he “minded” if the officer searched his person, it seems likely that few people would interpret this as a request for information about the suspect’s preferences.  Even the imperative form is often not a command:  While “Ready, Aim, Fire” is a command, “Shut the door, please” is usually seen as a request, and “Come in and sit down” is normally an invitation, “Watch out” is probably a warning, and the words “Enjoy your meal”, coming from a waiter in a restaurant,  is almost certainly more likely to be a wish than a command (p. 240). “The most common way to make a polite command is to phrase it as a request.”   A judge might issue a command to a law clerk by saying “Could you draft me a memo” (p. 241),  and few law clerks would try to turn an affirmative reply into a statement of the clerk’s memo-writing ability., In U.S. courts, however, judges have been selective in the manner in which they interpret language.  “May I see your driver’s licence” is almost certainly, coming from a police officer, an order (p. 241).   “When a person in a position of power ‘asks’ or ‘requests’ us to do something, it will normally be interpreted as a command” (p. 241). In part, this is the case because many people will assume that it is a legitimate command., A similar problem occurs when police officers ask about illegal substances (e.g., drugs, guns). When a suspect indicates that he has none, and then the officers asks, “Would you mind if I search your vehicle and contents to be sure there is no contraband in the vehicle?” (p. 246) this statement, which literally is a request for information about the suspect’s feelings,  is not likely to be interpreted in those terms.  In such a case, the citizen is primed to agree to the search in part because “Refusing consent will only make them appear suspicious, so that if the officer did not have a legal reason to search them previously, he would certainly have one now.  Add to this the inherent coerciveness of the situation, and it ceases to be surprising that such large numbers of people consent to searches during traffic stops” (p. 246).  “It was only if the occupants of the car were aware that the police had no authority to order them to open the trunk that the ‘request’ to search the trunk could be interpreted as a true request with an option of refusal” (p. 247).  Courts in the U.S., however, have tended to interpret words that are almost certainly received as commands as being requests.  As if by magic, the context disappears and words which are heard as commands are turned into requests., When a patron in a restaurant says “I’d like the salmon special” or “I feel like trying the salmon” it would be the waiter who was ideologically opposed to tips who would interpret this as being mere expressions of desire and reply, “That’s interesting. What would you like to order me to bring you?”.  Similarly, it would be our same tip-free waiter who would think that “Could you bring me a glass of water?” (p. 249) was a question about his ability to carry water across the room., When a person being interrogated for 6 hours without break suddenly says, “I need to use the toilet” (p. 250), the chances are that this is interpreted as a request, and perhaps even an urgent request.  But when a defendant says that he “might need to see a lawyer” or “would like to have a lawyer” courts have said that this is not the invoking of the right to counsel because (in the latter case) it is a statement of desire, not a request.  Thus when the question arises as to whether an accused person has invoked his or her right to counsel, U.S. courts suddenly force the speaker to use words whose meaning is not dependent on the context. The words, “I think I might need a lawyer” or “Maybe I need a lawyer” or “If I’m going to be charged with murder maybe I should talk to an attorney” (p. 251-2) are not seen, by U.S. courts,  as invoking the right to a lawyer because they are hedged just as “Didn’t you say I have the right to an attorney” was deemed by an appeals court not to be an invocation of the right because it merely asked a question., “Research by linguists over the past two or three decades has shown that an indirect speech style and greater use of hedging tends to be associated with people of lower socioeconomic status” (p. 253). Furthermore, while “men are more likely to make direct orders or requests, such as “close the door” or “Please close the door” women tend to use what are considered more polite formulations, “Will you close the door?” or “Won’t you close the door?” (p. 253).  This use of less powerful speech tends to be located primarily among those of lower social status.  Hence, the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision that “Maybe I should talk to a lawyer” was not an invocation of a right is likely to disadvantage certain groups within society., Conclusion. “Judges are selective in [their decisions about] when they take pragmatic factors into consideration… Their interpretive practices tend either to ignore or to take into account pragmatic information when it benefits police and prosecutors.  The utterances that police officers make in seeking consent to a search are almost invariably interpreted as requests, even if the officer poses what is literally an informational question or if the circumstances are such that the suspect is likely to interpret the utterance as an order that should not be refused….  In contrast people subject to interrogation are held to a higher linguistic standard than are the police: they must be quite literal in invoking their right to counsel” (p. 256)., Reference: Tiersma, Peter M. and Lawrence M.

"If ordinary Canadian citizens really think that sentences and the parole system are not harsh enough for the most serious cases, why don’t they act that way?",", Background. Public opinion surveys in Canada and elsewhere have suggested, for the past 35 years, that the public is dissatisfied with sentencing and with parole decisions, and would like both processes to be made harsher. In the area of parole, therefore, it would be easy to conclude that the public is “implacably opposed to granting parole [especially] to offenders convicted of those most serious crimes” (p. 104).  Most Canadians, in a public opinion poll conducted in 1987 said that murderers should not be eligible for parole (p. 108). Nevertheless, Canadian law allows all those serving life sentences to apply for parole.  Those convicted of murder and given parole ineligibility periods of more than 15 years can apply, after they have served 15 years, to go before a jury of 12 citizens and have the parole ineligibility period reduced – from an initial period of up to 25 years down to as little as 15 years., This study examines the results of the hearings held under S. 745 of the Criminal Code – best known in Canada as the “faint hope clause.”  Until 1 January 1997, the prisoner was successful in having the parole ineligibility period reduced if at least 8 of the 12 jury members were in favour of this outcome. Only about 25% of those eligible for a hearing applied. But of those cases (before 1 January 1997) in which hearings were held, 80% were successful in achieving at least some reduction in their parole ineligibility periods., After 1 January 1997, the rules were changed for those serving life sentences such that those convicted of multiple murders are ineligible to apply for an earlier parole hearing and a superior court judge must agree that there was a “reasonable prospect” for success.  Finally, the jury of 12 citizens has to be unanimous.  These changes were legislated immediately after one of Canada’s most notorious serial killers (Clifford Olson) had applied (unsuccessfully) to have his 25 year parole ineligibility period reduced.  The main effect of these changes appeared to have been to reduce the number of hearings: In the first three years after the rules changed, only about 12% of eligible prisoners had hearings.  But of those who did apply, 77% were successful., Conclusion.  Most Canadians indicate, in public opinion polls, that, in the abstract, they are in favour of keeping those convicted of murder in prison forever without allowing them to be eligible for parole.  Nevertheless, when given a chance to respond to individual cases, juries – by majority vote before 1997 and unanimously thereafter – are very likely to reduce the parole ineligibility period for those convicted of murder, even for those convicted of first degree murder.  When placed on juries, members of the public appear to be able to “discharge their duties to react as disinterested decision makers, even in cases involving prisoners serving life terms for the most heinous crimes” (p. 110).   “There may be an advantage in allowing jurors, rather than criminal justice professionals to make this decision.  If the decision to reduce the time served prior to parole eligibility is made by members of the public, the criticism that the parole system is too lax… loses much of its power” (p. 111).   Canadians, it seems, are not as tough as they sometimes sound., Reference: Roberts, Julian V.  (2002).

"The ideology, discourses, and policies having to do with imprisonment may have changed in the U.S., but for women in one of California’s women’s prisons, ‘doing time’ is pretty much the same as it was 40 years ago.",", Background.  Forty years ago, the U.S. federal and state imprisonment rate was approximately the same as Canada’s overall imprisonment rate.  It is now more than 4 times higher.  But the rate of imprisonment in the U.S. is not the only thing that has changed.  In the early 1960s, “the rehabilitative model dominated official penal discourse [in California]” (p. 268) but by the 1990s, there was, in the U.S.,  a “rejection of rehabilitative and normalizing goals [and] a growing emphasis on managerial goals and actuarial techniques to efficiently classify and contain what is seen as an essentially irredeemable population….” (p. 270).   But did this change in ideology have an impact on the day-to-day lives of those subject to it – the prisoners?, This study examines women’s experiences ‘doing time’ in the California Institution for Women (CIW) at two points in time: the early 1960s (the height of the rehabilitation era) and the mid-1990s (during the ‘get tough’ era).  The 1960s data came from a study by Ward and Kassebaum; the 1990s data were collected by the current authors, using interviews, informal discussions, and a survey of 887 inmates., In many ways, CIW changed over this 35 year period. In the 1960s, the assumption was that, compared to male prisoners, women “had different problems and consequently, they needed different treatment” (p. 279). “CIW… relied on maternal and therapeutic methods in its efforts at rehabilitation” (p. 279).  Correctional workers (all women), most of whom had college degrees and training in social work, and prisoners were expected to develop relationships “of genuine professional interest, seasoned with warmth and friendliness” (p. 279, quoting the staff manual of the period). In 1995, there were twice as many women in CIW as there had been in 1963.  Half of the correctional officers were men.  Local rules had been replaced by state rules which demonstrated clear evidence of a “shift from the rehabilitative model to a managerial model” (p. 281).  Rehabilitation, though talked about as a goal of imprisonment, “had become an individual, not an institutional, responsibility” (p. 282)., But how did all of this affect the experience of ‘doing time’ in CIW?  Prisoners in the two periods were interviewed and, on a survey, were asked a number of identical questions.  Generally speaking, in both periods, prisoners saw the best way to do one’s time was to mind one’s own business.  Detachment from and distrust of other prisoners was seen as the best strategy.  There were some differences in the results from the two time periods, but overwhelmingly, it was a matter of degree. As one woman who had been in CIW for 25 years noted (in 1995): “The faces have changed, the words have changed, the clothes have changed.  But the way women do time has not changed that much” (p. 298)., Conclusion: “Whether subject to the maternal, therapeutic regime of the 1960s that promoted rehabilitation through individualized treatment or to the neoliberal regime of the 1990s that shifted responsibility for rehabilitation onto prisoners, women at [the California Institution for Women] lived with and negotiated features of imprisonment  that shaped their experiences in comparable ways” (p. 299)., Reference: Gartner, Rosemary and Candace Kruttschnitt (2004).

Ordinary people are able to overcome their negative views of people with criminal records if they are given information about the person from a previous employer who indicates a willingness to rehire the former offender if given an opportunity to do so.,", Background. Political scientists in the U.K. have noted that “domestic social policy [in Britain] has more and more involved the importation of ideas from abroad, particularly from the United States” (p. 165).  In the area of criminal justice policies, this is particularly interesting in light of assessments such as that of an American historian who remarked: “The least controversial observation about American criminal justice today is that it is remarkably ineffective, absurdly expensive, grossly inhumane, and riddled with discrimination” (p. 166).  Why, then, do British politicians find these policies so seductive when they talk about “evidenced based” policy making?, The list of American criminal justice policy imports into the U.K. includes the following:, Why have these changes occurred? Various reasons are offered, including the following:, Conclusion. The U.K. has imported some U.S. criminal justice policies in part because they work, politically.   But “there remain some quite important differences between the two systems of social control… It [is] abundantly clear that penal rhetoric was generally a more successful import than penal policy. [For example] In the UK there has been significantly more talk of ‘zero tolerance’ than there has of [actual] zero tolerance policing.  A drug Czar has been appointed but as yet the punitive practices of the ‘war on drugs’ have been held largely at bay” (p. 184-5) though in other areas serious toughening appears to have occurred., Reference: Newburn, Tim.

New South Wales has managed to enact legislation that reduces the use of youth court proceedings.,", Background.  Australian states, like many jurisdictions (including Canada) have, in the past 40 years, moved away from a quasi-welfare model of responding to young offending toward a more justice orientation.  Along with this change has come a movement towards pre-court diversion and various forms of restorative conferencing.  New South Wales’ (NSW) Young Offenders Act 1997 (YOA) attempts to regulate police discretion and to use the courts only as a last resort.  The challenge faced by those drafting the YOA was that although  “the need to guide and regulate police discretion is… rarely disputed, … the appropriate mechanism for this regulation has been the subject of much debate and research” (p. 74).  Prior to 1997, NSW police instructions set out procedures and guidelines for the use of warnings and cautions by the police, but “these discretionary options were not well utilised” (p. 76)., The YOA provided “specific rules guiding police discretion in referral decisions” (p. 77). Warnings (in which admissions of guilt were not required) and cautions (where the youth had to admit guilt) were to be used for minor offences, whereas conferences were not supposed to be used for these offences.  If an investigating police officer thought a youth was not eligible for a warning/caution, a Specialist Youth Officer (SYO) would decide if the case should go to a conference or to court.  The decision of the SYO can be challenged by conference administrators.  Ultimately, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) “makes the final decision on whether the young [person] should be cautioned, dealt with by way of conference or referred to the court” (p. 79).  Finally, if the “court considers that a less intrusive intervention should have occurred, the magistrate can either administer a caution or refer [the case for a conference]” (p. 79)., The impact of the YOA on the use of youth court in NSW appeared to be quite dramatic.  In the first three years of the new law, there were approximately as many cases that came to the attention of the police as there had been in the previous three years.  Prior to the implementation of the new law, 82%-85% of these cases were sent to court.  In the three years after the implementation, 59%-68% went to court.  Some of this shift was due to the use of conferences, but about four times as many cases were diverted from court to cautions than were going to conferences.  The findings “provide no evidence that the introduction of the YOA has resulted in net widening of the overall juvenile justice system” (p. 84) – the increased use of cautions and conferences were offset by a reduction in the use of court., Conclusion. It would appear that having explicit rules about the exercise of discretion by police can make a difference.  Because the law governing discretion was an Act of Parliament (rather than a set of police directives) “the majority of officers took it seriously” (p. 90). In addition, the involvement of trained specialist youth officers in the decision making process along with various checks and balances for resolving disagreements meant that decisions were always being scrutinized. Finally, the legally mandated involvement of the prosecutor and, ultimately, the judge as gatekeepers to the court process meant that decisions by a single investigating police officer could not guarantee that a youth would end up in court., Reference: Chan, Janet, Jenny Bargen, Garth Luke and Garner Clancey.

An analysis of data from ten samples of sentenced sex offenders demonstrates that most sexual offenders who have been apprehended and sentenced do not commit further sexual offences.,", Background. For reasons that are not clear, many commentators seem to assume that once a person commits a sex offence, he will, if not imprisoned, continue committing these offences until he dies.  One difficulty in assessing the likelihood of recidivism is that recidivism is defined in different ways across studies.  Different follow-up periods and different criteria of offending (typically either charges or convictions) are used in different studies. In addition, different definitions of sex offences are used.  Different types of victims (children vs. adults, gender, incest vs. other types of relationships) are also studied. A previous study (Criminological Highlights, 6(3)#3) showed that recidivism rates for sexual offenders were generally no higher than recidivism rates for other types of offenders. This would suggest that a special focus on sex offenders (as opposed to other serious offenders) seems misplaced., Rather than looking at recidivism rates in a single sample, this study looked at 10 different sub-samples of adult male offenders (total N=4,724; 7 Canadian, 2 U.S. and 1 U.K. sample) with follow-up periods ranging from an average of 2 years to an average of 23 years. Most used re-conviction as the measure of recidivism, but there did not appear to be dramatic differences between the studies that reported only charges and those that reported convictions., The results demonstrate that pooling across all studies, 14% of the offenders had recidivated with another sexual offence after 5 years, 20% after 10 years, and 24% after 15 years.  When one looks at the recidivism rate for different types of victims, “boy victim child molesters” showed a 10 year recidivism rate of 28% as compared to 13% for “girl victim child molesters.”  Incest offenders had the lowest rate (9%) and rapists were about average (21%).  Not surprisingly, those with a previous conviction for a sexual offence were considerably more likely to re-offend sexually than those without a previous sexual conviction (32% vs. 15%).  Offenders over age 50 were considerably less likely to re-offend sexually within 10 years (11%) than were younger offenders (21%).  Generally speaking, the longer a person had been in the community, the less likely it was that he would re-offend., The recidivism results reported here are quite similar to those reported elsewhere.  A recent U.S. study, for example, found a sexual re-offending rate after 3 years of only 5.3% (See also Criminological Highlights, 3(3)#3;  5(1)#4; and 6(3)#3)., Conclusion. It is suggested that in considering policy on how to deal with convicted sex offenders, there is a need to “differentiate between the high public concern about these offences and the relatively low probability of sexual re-offence” (p. 11). Other studies would suggest that incapacitation is an inefficient approach to crime prevention for these offences, in part because of the unpredictability of who will, if not incapacitated, re-offend (see Criminological Highlights, 3(1)#1).  Given the difficulty in predicting re-offending, it would appear that incapacitating sex offenders will not be a more effective crime control measure than incapacitating any other type of offender., Reference: Harris, Andrew J.

"Carefully planned, well-motivated, social interventions for youths can have serious long-term negative impacts on this population. More specifically, they can lead to increased involvement in crime, alcoholism, mental illness, and early death.","Background.  Various programs are imposed on delinquent youths. When considering the impact of a program, the worst-case scenario is typically thought to be that an intervention will have no effect on young people. As such, many intuitively sensible programs run for years without being evaluated.  The problem is that they can harm as well as help. Starting in 1939 and for approximately 5.5 years thereafter, youths in “congested urban areas” of Cambridge and Somerville, Massachusetts, were interviewed and each was matched with another similar young person. As a result of a flip of a coin, one of these individuals was assigned to a control group in which normal social services in the community were provided. In contrast, the other youth was given intensive interventions including guidance, after-school activities, social support, tutoring, and medical and psychiatric attention. By the end of the program in 1945, the boys in the treatment group had generally received a variety of services and help -- from tutoring to medical intervention, being sent to summer camp, or assistance in finding a job. Many of them showed dramatic improvements and suggested - in a formal follow-up study conducted 20 years later – that the program had been beneficial to them. Based simply of these findings, one could not help but consider this program to have been a success., The results are not, however, as simple as one may have initially thought. Indeed, the improvements in the treatment group have to be compared to those in the control group before any confident conclusions regarding the success of the program may be drawn. In fact, it was found that almost equal numbers of youths in both groups showed unexpected improvement. Similarly, the overall involvement of the two groups in the criminal justice system was nearly identical. However, when these individuals were re-examined in a follow-up study between 1975 and 1981 (the youths were middle aged at this time), disturbing differences emerged. Those in the treatment group were more likely to have been convicted of serious crimes, to have died early, to have serious mental illness problems, and to be alcoholics than those in the control group. In fact, the deleterious effects of treatment appeared to occur most often with those youths who had cooperated most with the youth study staff. Indeed, the more frequently that they received treatment, the worse off they were. These harmful effects of the program were only evident because an equivalent control group was used.  Without the control group, a program that appeared to have had harmful effects would have been seen as a success., Unfortunately, this is not the only study that has demonstrated adverse effects of treatment. Other counseling programs (e.g., a court counseling program in the U.S., a social skills program, and a peer counseling program) have also been shown to have similar negative impacts., Conclusion. The lesson from interventions such as the 1939-45 Cambridge-Somerville program for young people is that programs which sound good can still have negative impacts. Said differently, we cannot automatically assume that interventions will have beneficial effects or at worst will have no effects. While the reasons for the adverse impacts are not clear, the lesson from this study is:  social interventions into the lives of youths need to be assessed carefully before they can be presumed to be safe, let alone helpful., Reference: McCord, Joan (2002).

"African-American automobile drivers are more likely to be stopped and questioned than other drivers, when taking into account the racial makeup of those who drive.  In addition, African-American drivers are particularly likely to be stopped in areas which are predominantly white.",", Background. Racial profiling - or “a police initiated action that relies on the race… rather than the behaviour of an individual…” (pp. 403-4) - has been the subject of considerable controversy and research. There is substantial evidence that a black American automobile driver is more likely than a white person to be stopped and questioned by the police. To the extent that the police believe that blacks are more inclined toward criminality, they can explain such a propensity to stop/question blacks as “good police work” (p.402). This explanation should be particularly salient if the black drivers are not in a “place” in which they might be seen as “belonging.” More specifically, if a driver is seen as being “out of place,” he or she may be especially subject to surveillance in the form of proactive police stops. To the extent that blacks are seen as having a low probability of living in the suburbs or middle class areas (and, therefore, are “out of place”), they should be particularly subject to proactive police stops in these locations., This study took advantage of the fact that police in the jurisdiction under examination have access to in-car computers, permitting them to check citizens directly without consulting anyone. Given that such computer verification can be seen as a form of surveillance and that the computer can be programmed to keep records of those persons (by way of the license plate number) who are queried, accurate records of the individuals who are subject to proactive record checks can be obtained. The department under study – in a city of 75,000 which is characterized as largely white and blue-collar, with a police force with few women and no minorities – borders a city that is predominantly black., The results are based on comparisons drawn between the race of those proactively stopped and questioned and the race of others driving on the roads in those neighbourhoods.  Thirteen percent of the drivers were African-Americans, but 27% of all proactive queries (on the mobile computer) were of this group. However, the proactive stopping of blacks was not uniform across the city.  The relative ratio (i.e. relative to the proportion of drivers of each race) of blacks to whites being stopped was highest in the areas of the city located furthest from the black residential areas. “As African American drivers move from [the sectors of the city that border black residential areas] their chances of being the subject of a query increase dramatically” (p.417). In fact, they are three to four times as likely to be stopped and questioned as their numbers in the driving population would suggest. 
  
The “hit rate” (i.e. the rate at which the computer indicated a legal problem with the car or driver) for African Americans was not significantly higher than that for whites. However, the “hit rate” for whites was higher than that for blacks in the white areas (i.e., locations distant from the black residential areas).  Finally, the proactive stops of blacks were particularly pronounced for those police officers who made frequent use, generally, of the in-car computers during proactive stops. It would seem that racial profiling is most frequent for those officers who carry out the most proactive stops., Conclusion. Compared to their numbers as drivers, blacks appear to be more likely than whites to be subject to proactive stops. This phenomenon is most pronounced when blacks are driving through white areas. These results suggest that “a focus on individual attitudes and behaviour [of police officers] misses the underlying societal and occupational structural problems that produce racial profiling” (p.423) since racial profiling was responsive to place., Reference: Meehan, Albert J. and Michael C.

House arrest reduces recidivism.,", Background. It has been repeatedly argued that the imprisonment of offenders may increase the likelihood of recidivism in part because imprisonment cuts off “conventional bonds and opportunities” (p.165). In contrast, intermediate sanctions may be effective because they can “preserve or strengthen conventional social bonds and help enmesh offenders in networks of informal social control” (p.166). As such, these non-custodial alternatives to incarceration have the virtue of providing reintegrative opportunities for an offender while simultaneously permitting closer monitoring and supervision than is typically available from traditional (less restrictive) forms of probation., This study examines the impact of various sanctions on recidivism independent of the effect of other factors known to be highly related to recidivism (e.g., criminal record, age, gender, marital status, race/ethnicity and level of education). The data were collected from a county in Indiana which, generally, had lower than average (state or national) crime rates and unemployment levels.  In addition, it had a relatively well-funded and staffed community corrections program that was seen as one of the state’s “flagship” (p.170) initiatives. The offenders in the study were those sentenced to one of the following: the county’s intermediate sanctions program, traditional probation, or the county jail or state prison. All subjects had a minimum follow-up period of two years (with the maximum “at risk” period being 6 years) during which time they had the opportunity to re-offend. The analysis controlled for the offender’s length of time “on the street.”, Qualitative data from interviews of criminal justice personnel in the county suggest that those offenders seen as less problematic tended to receive probation only (rather than house arrest alone or in combination with another sanction). House arrest was seen as being appropriate for those whose records precluded traditional probation. Therefore, those receiving house arrest were more likely than were simple probationers to be seen as problematic offenders., The results show that recidivism patterns were consistent with those found in other studies. More specifically, males, those with less education, property offenders and those with longer prior criminal records were more likely to re-offend. Over and above these factors though, those who had received house arrest – alone or combined with other sanctions – were less likely to be re-arrested than were those sentenced to probation alone. Other sanctions – incarceration and work release – did not appear to differ from probation. This generalization held true for those given house arrest in combination with either incarceration or probation. Indeed, “[e]ach sentence combination that includes house arrest [was] associated with significantly decreased likelihood of arrest” (p.178). Interestingly, when looking at offenders who had received probation as part of their sentences, those given house arrest were more likely to have their probation revoked., Conclusion.  House arrest appears to be an effective sanction for offenders. “The sentence combination associated with the least likelihood of re-arrest was house arrest/probation” (p.184).  One explanation for this finding might be that house arrest puts offenders in touch with various rehabilitative services while simultaneously providing close monitoring. It may be precisely this combination which is critical for achieving positive results., Reference: Ulmer, Jeffrey T. (2001).

The drop in Canada’s homicide rate over the past 25 years is not closely related to changes in the age distribution of the Canadian population.,", Background. U.S. and Canadian homicide rates have had similar trends over the last 40 years, even though rates in Canada have always been lower than those of its closest neighbour. In each country, rates doubled from the early 1960s to the mid -1970s. After subsequently declining to some extent but peaking again in the early 1990s, both Canadian and U.S. rates have been dropping ever since. Having said this, homicides in the U.S. tend to have somewhat different characteristics from those committed in Canada. For example, American homicides are roughly twice as likely to involve firearms (especially handguns) and are more concentrated in large cities than are Canadian homicide rates. Various explanations have been proposed for the drop in homicides in the U.S. (e.g., changes in gun availability, an increase in the prison population, changes in the crack cocaine markets in inner cities). However, an American study (See Highlights, Volume 2, Number 6, Item 7) has demonstrated that changes in the demographic makeup of the U.S. accounted for only a small proportion of the decline in homicide rates., This study looks at age specific rates of homicide offending and assesses the impact of changes in the age distribution of the Canadian population on overall homicide rates. “Age specific rates” of homicide are the rates at which particular age groups (e.g., those in their 20s) commit homicide offences. Changes in “demographics” would appear to provide a plausible explanation for decreases in homicide rates in Canada: the proportion of individuals over thirty years old (typically people not involved in serious crime) has increased over the past 40 years while the proportion of those in their late teens and 20s (those more likely to be involved in serious crime) has decreased., The results do not support this theory. More specifically, they suggest that the most important changes in Canada since the mid-1970s are the rates at which individuals of almost all ages commit offences. In fact, Canadians 20-24 years old, 25-29, 30-39, and 40 and over all committed homicides at a lower rate in the late 1990s than they did in the mid-1970s. In contrast, the rates for 15-19 year olds increased slightly during this period.  If Canadians of each age group during the period 1995-9 committed homicides at the rates that the same age cohort did in 1974-9 (i.e. if the age specific rates had not changed), the overall rate of homicide offenders in the population would have declined by 4.3%. In actuality, there was a 31.8% decrease in the proportion of individuals identified as homicide offenders. “This means that of the total decrease… roughly 14% was due to changes in the age structure of the Canadian population” (p.355)., Conclusion. Homicide trends in the U.S. and Canada have been fairly similar in the past 25 years, though overall rates have been higher in the U.S. than in Canada. Further, in neither country are changes in the age structure important in understanding changes in homicide rates. More intriguingly, the changes in age specific rates of homicide offending appear to be similar (the exception being Canadians aged 15-19 years old). Therefore, explanations which focus on the activities of specific sectors of the population (e.g., those in their 20s) or their proportion in the population are not particularly useful in looking at the overall changes taking place across age groups., Reference: Sprott, Jane B. and Carla Cesaroni (2002).

Police officers are no more accurate than naïve or trained university students at detecting whether or not a person being interrogated is telling the truth.,", Background. Previous research has failed to support the claim that individuals are accurate in making judgements about whether others are being truthful or deceptive. Generally speaking, people do not score above “chance” in detecting deceit in individuals whom they did not previously know. Furthermore, training does not appear to improve the rate of success of those attempting to detect deception. Indeed, other emotions – e.g., fear or embarrassment – are often confused with deceit. A summary of 6 independent studies shows that overall accuracy did not exceed chance and that training did not increase participants’ ability to discriminate truth from deception. Interestingly though, training and prior experience (e.g., as a police officer) in attempting to discern deceit seemed to increase the likelihood that people would perceive deception.  In addition, it appeared that people who had received standard police training in detecting deceit were more confident in their abilities to succeed at this task even though their performance was not more likely to be accurate than that of lay persons., This study - building on previous research (See Highlights 2 (6) Item 8) - assessed the deception-detection abilities of a sample of American and Canadian police officers.  The police officers were shown a set of videotapes of interrogations involving people who either had or had not participated in a staged crime. All suspects denied involvement in the criminal activity. Participants in the study were told that between ¼ and ¾ of the suspects were lying., The results show that police officers’ overall accuracy was no better than chance. Compared to naïve and trained students who had - in the previous study - viewed the same tapes, the police officers were no more likely to correctly detect deception. However, they were more confident in their performance. Unfortunately, judgement accuracy and confidence were not related. Indeed, police officers who were confident that they had correctly judged a suspect to be telling the truth or lying were no more likely to be accurate than officers who were not certain in their judgements. The number of years of experience as a police officer was also unrelated to accuracy in detecting deception.  Nevertheless, participants in the experiment with the longest time on a police force had a greater tendency to judge suspects as deceitful and, as such, were more likely than less experienced officers to decide that honest suspects were lying., Conclusion. Neither police officers nor university students are good at judging whether individuals whom they do not know are lying or telling the truth. In fact, police officers appear to be no better at this task than chance or than ordinary people. Nevertheless, the police are more confident in their abilities to detect deception. This finding is of particular concern when one considers that a confident - but incorrect - police officer may conclude that an innocent person is guilty. In this case, not only does a miscarriage of justice become a real possibility, but the police officer may also discontinue investigations which could lead to the apprehension of the real offender., Reference: Meissner, Christian A. and Saul M.

High concentrations of Black and Latino immigrants in U.S. cities are not reliably linked to increases in homicides involving members of those groups.,", Background. Even though research on early 20th-century immigration to the U.S. suggests that immigrants were less involved in crime than their native neighbours, the stereotypic notion of the black (or, in the U.S., Latino) immigrant being a source of serious violent crime has persisted. While certain sociological theories (e.g., the “culture of poverty” hypothesis, social disorganization, opportunity structure theories) would predict that these groups were likely to participate in criminal activity, it could be equally argued that immigrants -- who typically have strong ties to the labour market and to family -- should be less involved in crime., This study examines homicides (probably the only crime in which reasonably reliable data exist on the race/ethnicity of the offender) at the “census tract” level in each of three cities (Miami, San Diego, and El Paso) between 1985 and 1995. This research assessed whether the proportion of “new immigrants” (those arriving in 1980 or later) was related to the number of homicides apparently committed by Blacks and Latinos. The effects of “standard” predictors of crime -- poverty, proportion of young males in the population, unemployment, residential instability (vacancy rates and population turnover), etc. – were held constant., The results show no consistent impact of immigration patterns on homicide offences across the three cities. More specifically, the proportion of new immigrants in a census tract in El Paso was negatively associated with Latino homicides (i.e. an increase in the number of immigrants was related to a reduction in the number of homicides). No effects of immigration on Latino homicides were found in Miami or San Diego., The data for black homicides was equally inconsistent. The proportion of new immigrants was negatively associated with black homicides in Miami, positively associated with black homicides in San Diego and had no significant effect on them in El Paso., Other factors showed stronger impacts. For instance, the proportion of those members of the group (Black or Latino) in the census tract living in poverty was positively associated with homicides in 5 of the 6 comparisons (i.e. Blacks and Latinos in each of three cities).  Residential instability was also positively associated with Black and Latino homicides in El Paso and San Diego (but not Miami). Further, while the proportion of unemployed black males in the census tract was positively associated with black homicides, the proportion of unemployed Latino males was not related to Latino homicides., Conclusion. The factors that shape group-specific homicide risk appear to vary across groups and across cities. Furthermore, the proportion of new immigrants was as likely to be negatively associated with homicides as it was to be positively related. Hence, when looking for explanations for homicide rates, it would appear more sensible to examine factors other than immigration patterns. As this research has shown, measures of economic deprivation, labour market involvement, and residential instability seem to offer more promising explanatory factors. However, social policies aimed at reducing violence may also need to be considered and evaluated in line with the local context., Reference:  Lee, Matthew T.; Ramiro Martinez, Jr., and Richard Rosenfeld (2001).

"Heroin users get their money from various sources -- legal and illegal.  However, only a relatively small portion of their income comes from property crime.",", Background.  Research carried out in a number of western countries suggests that heroin users - and presumably other “hard drug” users - engage in significant amounts of property crime.  Similarly, several studies of imprisoned adult property offenders have found that as many as two thirds spend at least part of their income on drugs. While informative, this literature clearly lacks systematic studies of heroin users which focus on the identification of the sources(s) of their total income., This study draws on data from 202 heroin users who agreed to participate in in-depth interviews which inquired into a wide range of issues surrounding their lives and incomes. Subjects were residents of Sydney, Australia and were primarily male, young, relatively uneducated (average: 9 years of schooling) and unemployed (76%). When interviewed, most participants were not in a drug treatment program, although the majority had participated in one at some point in the past. To minimize problems of recall, respondents were only asked about income and expenditures relative to the previous week. In addition to drug use, almost all (91%) subjects reported illegal behaviour in the week prior to being interviewed., Results of the interviews show that 70% derived at least a portion of their income from acquisitive property crime, with the median amount obtained during the previous week being A$450 (mean=A$782). Approximately one quarter (28%) of participants had committed a burglary in the week prior to being interviewed. Surprisingly though, property offences accounted for only 38% of their total income. This proportion is comparable to the findings from 7 other studies carried out in 6 different countries in which the range was found to be between 19% (Norway) and 65% (England). Beyond this source of revenue, 70% of respondents also indicated that a portion of their total income (in the form of drugs or money) was obtained from the drug trade. More specifically, transactions in the drug market were found to account for 44% of their income. In contrast, 59% reported having received some legitimate income. “In kind” income was reported by 28%. Women were more likely than men to obtain income from prostitution and legitimate sources., Conclusions.  The income needed to purchase heroin did not appear to come from any single source. Rather, sources of income were fluid and depended on opportunity. Like many people with no obvious sources of income, drug users draw on any available means. They include illegal activities such as property crime. However, drug users also receive income from the drug trade itself and from legitimate activities. Said differently, the findings of this study challenge the widely held assumption that the income of drug users is largely derived from property offences. Thus assessments of the value of the drugs used daily by addicts should not be used to estimate the amount obtained through acquisitive property crime., Reference:  Maher, Lisa; David Dixon; Wayne Hall and Michael Lynskey (2002).

"“Getting tough” on juvenile crime has its costs.  When compared to the benefits, it may not be worth it.",", Background. Those who support “getting tough” on young offenders rarely think about the costs of that which they advocate. Given that those areas of social life which are supported, in part, by government -- health care, education, transportation, housing -- are all in need of money, it is important to consider the costs and benefits of “tough approaches” to youths. Unfortunately, there has been little serious “cost-benefit” analysis of youth justice policies. In this light, this case study is interesting not so much because of its conclusions but rather because it helps to identify some of the variables that need to be assessed when evaluating the utility of youth justice policies., This study compares “tougher” responses to their less punitive alternatives. More specifically, this research examines: probation vs. diversion, intensive vs. regular probation, open custody vs. probation, and prison vs. open custody. The principal data for the study come from the records of 13,144 youths referred to the Texas Youth Commission in Dallas County., The results suggest that the following factors are important when thinking about the costs and benefits of “tough approaches” to young offenders:
Apprehension rates may increase as a function of surveillance (e.g., probation rather than deferred prosecution or diversion). As such, additional justice costs “down stream” of an initial decision may exist. Similarly, offending obviously decreases temporarily as a result of incarceration.
Second or subsequent dispositions tend to be more severe than earlier dispositions. This is also the case in Canada: See Criminological Highlights, 4(4), Item 3. Hence, criminal justice costs increase at the second disposition largely as a function of the disposition handed down in an earlier case. The “costs” of a harsh disposition, therefore, may appear later in a youth’s court career. 
The first time someone is apprehended, police, court, probation, prosecution, legal aid, and detention costs have to be initially considered in terms of additional costs for the harsher of two sentences. However, there are likely to be additional costs in each of these domains at subsequent apprehensions. In this study, it was found that these expenditures tended to increase - sometimes dramatically - as a function of the disposition that was being sought. Of course, the costs largely reflect what happens after the decision is made on how to dispose of the case. 
Costs to victims and others of additional crimes clearly also have to be taken into consideration. Estimates of these factors vary enormously.
Benefits to victims can be found in the form of short term incapacitation effects. For instance, it was found in this one case study that placement in a local facility could reduce victim costs (including estimated “quality of life” costs) by as much as $1718 per offender (but only $666 if “quality of life” cost estimates were not included). The difficulty is that this “saving” was far outweighed by the additional criminal justice expenditures involved ($15,190 or $23,680 per offender depending on certain assumptions)., Conclusion. The results of any estimation exercise such as this one have to be considered with caution. However, this simulation suggests that there were no criminal justice savings obtained from harsher policies compared to alternatives.  In addition, the authors’ estimates of gains for victims and others are only substantial when “quality of life” factors are included in the equation. In some instances, tough penalties may even increase estimated costs to victims. Indeed, harsh policies appear to augment crime and criminal justice processing in the long term, despite temporarily deferring criminal activity as a result of the sentence that is handed down., Reference: Fass, Simon M. and Chung-Ron Pi (2002).

"Crime is more of an election issue in the U.S. than one may initially think. Indeed, the policy of disenfranchisement of anyone in prison or on probation/parole as well as those who were ever convicted of a felony has ensured Republican control of the Senate and was one of the ways in which George W. Bush managed to win the presidency in 2000.","Background. In contrast with Canada in which the Supreme Court has recently returned the right to vote to those serving sentences, all but three of the 51 U.S. electoral jurisdictions (i.e. Maine, Massachusetts, and Vermont) disenfranchise at least some of those who have had contact with the criminal justice system (i.e. prisoners, parolees, felony probationers, jail inmates and/or those who have served their complete sentence for a felony). For example, it is estimated that 7% of adult American citizens in Florida cannot vote because of felony disenfranchisement. In addition, the U.S. is unique in restricting rights of non-incarcerated felons including those who have served their full sentence. This group makes up ¾ of disenfranchised Americans. Further, because black Americans are particularly likely to be imprisoned or placed under criminal justice control, their right to vote is disproportionately affected. Clearly, it is important to examine the impact that voting rights policies can have on the democratic process. Historically, the establishment of the formal right to vote “has varied from country to country [and] has always been a slow, contested and uneven process” (p.777). While other groups in the U.S. (e.g., women, African-Americans) have won the right to vote over the past 200 years, felons (current or past) have slowly lost this same right. Particularly in recent years, felony disenfranchisement has become a serious issue because of the U.S. enthusiasm for prosecution (e.g., drug offences) and imprisonment. Indeed, the result is that 2.3% of American adults could not vote in 2000 compared to only approximately 1% in 1975., This paper carefully estimates – using voting data, election surveys and demographic information about voters and felons – the likelihood that felons would have voted (if permitted) and for whom they would have been likely to vote. From surveys, it is clear that those who constitute the “felon” population are considerably less likely to vote than other Americans. For those who do, in fact, vote, they are considerably more likely to vote Democratic than most U.S. citizens. The validity of the voting assumptions made in this paper was tested in a longitudinal survey in Minnesota. The demographic variables used in the larger study to estimate voter turnout and party preference accounted completely for the differences between “felons” and others. In other words, the estimates used in this study appear to be valid., The results of this study suggest that the U.S. Senate - in the 2000 election - would almost certainly be under Democratic control if felons had been able to vote. Aside from other problems with the election in Florida, Gore would also have easily won if this population had had the right to vote. In fact, Gore would still have beat Bush if only ex-felons had been allowed to participate in the election or only half of the estimated voter turnout rate for this group had been permitted to vote. While this paper focuses exclusively on presidential and senate elections, one would expect that the effects of felony disenfranchisement would be even larger at the local level., Conclusion: Crime policy is, naturally, the result of a political process. Conservative governments that wish to remain in power are clearly aided by policies that disenfranchise individuals serving sentences and those who have been convicted of a felony at least once during their life. A previous study (see Criminological Highlights, Volume 1, Number 4, Item 1) demonstrated that imprisonment policy has a distorting impact on unemployment figures. This paper demonstrates that crime policies impact on the political process itself., Reference: Uggen, Christopher and Jeff Manza (2002). Democratic Contraction?

"Compared with offenders who are not caught, those who are, in fact, apprehended are less likely to believe that they will be caught again in the future.",", Background.  If specific deterrence “works”, punished offenders should be less likely to believe that they can get away with crime than those not apprehended.  However, recent studies show the opposite. More specifically, it has been found that “punished individuals believe the certainty of being sanctioned in the future is lower than do their less punished colleagues” (p.96). Clearly, they seem to think that “the punishment experience helps insulate them from future apprehension” (p.96). There are two possible explanations for this assumption. On the one hand, those who are apprehended may be individuals who generally consider the likelihood of being caught as low. On the other hand, offenders may believe in the “gambler’s fallacy” – that is, the belief that relatively rare events are unlikely to reoccur, especially soon afterward. Accordingly, the apprehended individual may believe that because he/she was caught “this time” (in contrast with the multiple times in which he/she had offended and was not caught), he/she will not be apprehended again., This study asked university students to consider a hypothetical situation in which they had been drinking, were probably intoxicated, and had to decide whether to drive home. These subjects estimated the likelihood that they would, in fact, drive. They were also asked to report the number of times that they were “stopped by the police when they believe their blood alcohol content was above the legal limit” (p.103). In order to control for other relevant factors, the subject’s “risk status” was estimated by determining whether each respondent fit a “drunk driving risk profile” (p.103). This profile included such variables as the amount of alcohol that he/she typically consumed, prior offending and drinking-driving by peers, as well as various individual characteristics such as gender and impulsivity., A measure of belief in the gambler’s fallacy was obtained by having respondents imagine that a coin was flipped and it came up heads four times in a row. They were subsequently asked “whether on the fifth flip, the coin was more likely to land heads, tails, or whether both outcomes were equally likely” (p.105). Twenty percent of the subjects answered “tails” – the response consistent with the gambler’s fallacy., The results initially showed that those respondents who had previously been caught were more likely to indicate that they would drink-drive than their non-apprehended counterparts. However, a more detailed analysis reveals that this effect is attributable largely to low risk offenders. Compared with low risk individuals who had not been apprehended, those (low risk) people who had previously been caught were considerably less likely to think that they would be apprehended if they drove while impaired. Said differently, those with a relatively low risk of offending appear to believe in the gambler’s fallacy whereby their initial apprehension is seen by them as a shield from being caught in the future. In contrast, there was no impact of previous apprehensions and no evidence that the belief in the gambler’s fallacy was related to the perceived likelihood of future apprehension for those at high risk of offending., Conclusion. These findings “raise questions about whether punishment is as efficacious a specific deterrent as deterrence theory suggests” (p.114). It may be that vicarious punishment – the perception that others are likely to be apprehended – makes individuals less likely to offend. However, the personal experience of being apprehended appears to make low risk people believe that - next time - they can get away with it., Reference: Pogarsky, Greg and Alex R. Piquero (2003).

Sentencing youths as youths makes crime control sense: A study of transfers to adult court demonstrates that adult court and adult sentences are criminogenic,", Background.  For some, treating young offenders as adults is seen as an attractive “solution” to youth crime. In fact, many state legislatures in the U.S. have increased the ease with which young offenders may be considered - for criminal justice purposes - to be adults. However, the usefulness of such harsh treatment has been challenged by a growing body of research suggesting that the transfer of youths to adult court does not, in fact, reduce recidivism or deter other youths (see, for example, Criminological Highlights, Volume 1, Number 3, Item 2; Volume 1, Number 5, Item 5; Volume 2, Number 4, Item 3; Volume 3, Number 5, Item 5)., This study examines the notion that the transfer of young offenders to adult court reduces the re-offending rates of this population. To rule out a potential selection bias – that is, the possibility that high recidivism among transferred youths merely reflects the fact that only the worst youths are treated as adults – this paper controlled, to some extent, for offence by looking only at robbery and aggravated assault. Further, this study statistically holds constant other variables known to be associated with recidivism in order to assess the impact of transfer on re-offending. Recidivism was defined in this research as arrests that occurred after the final disposition of the case. Not surprisingly, a number of differences (e.g., criminal record of the youth) existed between the transferred population and those retained in youth court., The results are easy to describe:  “Waived [transferred] youths were more likely to be rearrested following final disposition than were their counterparts in juvenile court” (p. 90). In fact, “[b]eing waived to adult court more than doubled the simple odds of a postdisposition arrest” (p. 90).  Furthermore, “youths transferred to adult court were rearrested more quickly following final disposition than were their counterparts who remained in juvenile court” (p. 92). In addition, this same population was more likely to be rearrested for a violent offence than the young offenders who remained in youth court., There are a number of possible explanations for this effect. One possibility is that appropriate treatment facilities may be more available in youth court than in adult court. It is also plausible that those youth transferred to adult court gain the opportunity to learn from more experienced adult offenders about how to commit crimes. Finally, it is possible that the impact of being publicly labelled as a criminal has negative repercussions., Conclusion. These findings are similar to those from other studies. “It seems, then, that legislative waiver laws… can realistically be expected to have little or no deterrent utility. In fact, the evidence suggests a criminogenic effect – or that these laws may serve to increase the frequency and seriousness of future offending by those youths who are excluded from juvenile court” (p.94)., Reference: Myers, David L.

Nations that spend a high proportion of their gross domestic product on health care and public education and have relatively low income inequality tend also to have lower homicide rates.,", Background.  Studies of social support have shown that communities which are cohesive and whose members are willing to help others as well as support those in need tend to have relatively lower crime rates (See, for example, Criminological Highlights, Volume 1, Number 1, Item 1; Volume 1, Number 5, Item 1; Volume 1, Number 6, Item 4). Within the U.S. and Canada, states and provinces with low income inequality also have low homicide rates (See, Criminological Highlights, Volume 4, Number 2, Item 3)., These papers look at homicide rates across nations as a function of three structural variables: the proportion of GDP spent on public education, the proportion of GDP spent on health care and, finally, the level of income inequality in the country.  Public education and health care expenditures were highly related (i.e. countries that spent a substantial amount of money on one also tended to invest a great deal in the other). The first paper (on the impact of health and education expenditures) also controlled for such factors as economic inequality and the level of general socioeconomic development in the country., The results show that the three structural variables under study are, in fact, associated with homicide rates. Looking across 46 nations over the period 1989-1995, countries that had relatively high expenditures on public education and health tended to have low homicide rates. This relationship continued to exist even after economic inequality and the proportion of the population living in urban areas were statistically held constant., The second study examined income inequality. Part of the difficulty with any cross-national study has to do with the quality of the data. In this study, analyses were repeated using only data from nations in which it was believed that highly reliable figures could be obtained. Regardless of the analysis, “[n]ations with high levels of income inequality exhibit relatively high homicide rates, controlling for other socio-demographic characteristics of nations” (p.386). Interestingly, when one looks longitudinally (i.e. at changes across five-year periods) instead of cross-sectionally at the data, short term (and presumably fairly small) changes in income inequality did not make a difference., Conclusions: As with other studies, income inequality and measures of expenditures on basic health and education programs were found to be important in understanding homicide rates. Sometimes described as indicators of social support for those individuals in society who are the most disadvantaged, these types of measures clearly appear to affect the level of lethal violence in a country., References: Pratt, Travis C. and Timothy W.

Warnings given by police to suspects concerning their rights have had a “negligible effect on the ability of the police to elicit confessions and on the ability of prosecutors to win convictions” (p. 203).,", Background. When the Miranda warnings were imposed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1966, police and prosecutors suggested that it would no longer be possible to obtain confessions and that offenders would go unpunished. However, early studies on the actual use and effectiveness of this legal requirement did not find strong empirical support for the belief that prosecutions would be made more difficult. Rather, they suggested that warnings tended to be given most often in important cases “when failure to do so might jeopardize the admissibility of a highly valued confession” (p.233). At the same time, it was noted that most suspects did not appear to fully understand the impact and importance of the material in the warning. Furthermore, some research suggested that the required warnings neither affected the likelihood that an accused would confess nor the success of prosecutions (p.234). Although other work found a somewhat lower confession rate for certain offences, this phenomenon did not invariably translate into a lower conviction rate. In fact, it was concluded in one study that “police interrogators used the warnings to their advantage to create the appearance that a voluntary statement had been obtained” (p.234). Generally speaking, the early studies suggested that “the Miranda rules had only a marginal effect on the ability of the police to elicit confessions and on the ability of prosecutors to win convictions, despite the fact that some detectives continued to perceive a substantial Miranda impact” (p.238)., This paper contrasts these early conclusions regarding the use and effectiveness of Miranda warnings with those from more recent studies. While “quantitative claims [made by those arguing that the warnings have impeded prosecutions] have not been generally accepted in either the legal or social science community” (p.244), they underline the controversy which still surrounds this legal requirement. In an attempt to synthesize the current consensual view of the Miranda warning, this study notes the following points:
While the police give warnings in almost all cases in which they are legally required, questioning does occur “outside” Miranda.
The police have developed strategies which induce Miranda waivers in part by downplaying the significance of the warning or suggesting that benefits may be attributed to those individuals who talk to them.
Waivers are given in most (78-96%) police interrogations although this percentage drops with suspects who have a criminal record. As one researcher noted, “[n]ext to the warning label on cigarette packs, Miranda is the most widely ignored piece of official advice in our society” (p.247). 
In some jurisdictions, police are trained to violate the warning.
There appear to be fewer seriously abusive interrogations than there were 40 years ago.  Nevertheless, “Miranda has not changed the psychological interrogation process that it condemned but has only motivated police to develop more subtle and sophisticated – and perhaps more compelling – interrogation strategies” (p.255)., Conclusion: The Miranda warning may “tap into a basic vein of fairness that transcends the [Supreme Court’s original] assumptions about the diminished free will of suspects facing police interrogation” (p.265). However, there is no consistent evidence that it has affected the ability of an accused person to resist giving a confession. Part of the reason for this reality appears to be because “the police adjusted to [the necessity of giving] Miranda [warnings] and learned how to comply in a way that minimizes the chance that the suspect will resist interrogation” (p.207). In other words, it would seem that police clearly include the right to confess as part of the Miranda warning., Reference: Thomas, George C. III, and Richard A. Leo. (2002). The Effects of Miranda v.

"“Home detention” may be seen as an appealing alternative to prison. However, it has serious problems that may easily be overlooked by those searching for a “quick fix” custodial substitute.",", Background. Home detention has seen a dramatic increase in popularity not only in Canada but in other jurisdictions as well (e.g., the State of Victoria, Australia recognizes it as an explicit sentencing option). Its attractiveness would seem to reside in its ability to reduce state costs and avoid the harmful effects of prison while simultaneously still being associated with the general ‘tough on crime’ approach to sentencing which is currently in vogue. Unfortunately, this justification not only lacks empirical support but also ignores other problematic issues related to this sentencing option., This paper discusses a number of problems which emerge from a more careful examination of “home detention”. These include the following:, Conclusion: If the main purpose of implementing a home detention policy is to save money and/or reduce imprisonment, there are other, potentially less problematic, ways in which this objective could be accomplished. For instance, proportionate sanctions could be imposed and the overall level of punishment reduced. Further, other sanctions (e.g., community service, fines, etc.) may be more appropriate, particularly for low risk non-violent offenders. Indeed, it would seem more sensible to explore the adaptability of existing sanctions before jumping on the bandwagon of new – not yet fully tested - sentencing options., Reference: Bagaric, Mirko (2000).

"About half of the criminals in adult courts were never, officially, young offenders.  Nevertheless, the characteristics of adult-onset offenders and those who committed crimes both as children and as adults are quite similar.",", Background. It is often assumed that a person who is found to have committed an offence as an adult must have also had contact with the justice system as a youth. As a result, “adult onset” offending has lacked careful examination. However, most offending – judging from official records of arrest – can be attributable to adults rather than youths. Therefore, even if a high portion of these adults does not have young offender records, their actual (raw) numbers may be large. In fact, an assessment of 15 longitudinal studies using official records show that while approximately 52% of delinquent youths apparently went on to commit at least one offence as adults, the portion of adult offenders who had no record of offending as youths was still about 50%. Clearly, adult onset offending (at least as measured by official records) accounts for a substantial amount of crime., This study examines the determinants of early (as youths) versus late (as adults) onset offending in an attempt to discover whether the factors predicting adult onset offending are similar to those of youth onset offending. It employs a set of data involving people born in the 1940s in Racine, Wisconsin. Police contacts for non-traffic and non-status offences were examined until the sample subjects were in their 30s., The findings were quite consistent: The factors associated with youth onset offending were the same as the factors which predicted adult onset offending. Said differently, certain demographic variables (i.e. race, gender, social class, family size) were correlated with whether or not a person offended as an adult - both for those who had committed crimes as a youth and those who were not young offenders. In a similar vein, various aspects of the person’s adolescent life (i.e. whether the person had dropped out of school or used marijuana during adolescence) had the same relationship to adult offending for those with and without criminal records as a youth. Characteristics of the respondent as an adult (e.g., whether the respondent had friends who offended) also had the same relationship to adult offending for both individuals with youth records and those with no youth criminal history. In other words, the predictors of adult offending were the same for those who had also offended as youths and for those who had a clean youth record., Conclusion: Although adult onset offending is relatively rare compared to youth onset offending, the individuals who do not get around to committing offences until they are adults are still important as they constitute approximately half of the offenders brought to adult court at least once. However, it is equally true that social policies aimed at decreasing the likelihood of one type of offending would appear to have the same positive effect on the other type of offending. In other words, it may be possible to prevent two jail birds with one policy stone., Reference: Eggleston, Elaine P. and John H. Laub (2002).

"Press coverage of crime waves may not only describe the phenomenon. Rather, the way in which the media ‘constructs’ or defines crime may also have a direct impact on the frequency in which it occurs.",", Background. The existing research on crime waves has tended to focus attention on either the objective (i.e. measurable shifts in frequency or seriousness) or the subjective (i.e. claims made by media, public perceptions, and other experiential components) characteristics of this phenomenon. The problem with this approach is that it ignores the interconnections between these two dimensions. As a consequence, social analyses tend to be partial, lacking “balance or comprehension” (p.56)., This paper is an attempt to overcome this difficulty. More specifically, it examines the newspaper coverage of the “black hand” crime wave of violence and extortion which came to be associated with Italian communities in American and Canadian cities during the first two decades of the 20th century. As press reports of blackmail and violent crime in the “Little Italys” of North America multiplied, the image conjured up was that of a mysterious criminal organization that was controlled in Sicily but extended to every sizable North American city with an Italian community. This notion of dangerous organized crime was fueled by media accounts claiming widespread reluctance on the part of victims of ‘black hand’ extortion to reveal the names of offenders. In fact, this ‘tendency’ not to cooperate with the police was portrayed by the press as further evidence of the “viciousness of ‘black hand’ criminals and … the vulnerability and susceptibility of their victims” (p.68) rather than a reasonable response from this particular population. Especially in light of the low level of police protection afforded to residents of Italian communities, the small number of Italian officers in the police department, the realistic nature of so many of the extortion threats, and the inability of many potential victims to arm themselves, their reluctance to assist police may, in fact, simply constitute a rational and justifiable course of action., The findings from this study’s examination of the ‘black hand’ press coverage suggest that the media “construction” of this crime wave served, in fact, as a “cultural resource” (p.68) for both predators and their prey. More precisely, offenders could use it “to facilitate extortion demands of various sorts” (p.68) while it provided victims with a means of understanding “a variety of forms of predation to which they might be subjected” (p.69). In this way, “the publicity associated with ‘black hand’ crime may have widened the opportunity structure for extortionate crimes by allowing offenders to present themselves as dangerous, and by encouraging them to think of their victims as easily manipulated” (p.71). Indeed, the significant coverage associated with this particular crime and the widespread use of the ‘black hand’ label may have had a direct impact on the frequency in which this crime occurred by “encouraging its utilization by offenders as a coercive technique” (p.70)., Conclusion. Because “many crime waves likely involve the dynamic interplay of changes in crime levels and changes in the social definition of crime,” it is important that “both the content and the meaning of criminal events be made problematic” (p.56). The analysis of the ‘black hand’ crime wave suggests that “the role that social problems constructions makes available to offenders (and to victims) can, under certain circumstances, facilitate these predator interactions” (p.74). Recognition of this feedback model may serve as an important warning within a contemporary context. Media claims surrounding the reluctance on the part of some groups to name offenders (e.g., blacks in Toronto) may have the effect of broadening the opportunities for the commission of subsequent offences. Further, it may distort reality by ignoring other more reasonable – albeit less sensationalistic – explanations for the non-reporting of certain kinds of crimes., Reference: Sacco, Vincent F. (2002).

"Restorative justice approaches which are tied to the criminal justice system raise important questions about “the proper division of functions between the state, victims, offenders, and ‘communities’” (p.578). Further, “greater emphasis upon procedural safeguards and substantive limits in the pursuit of the apparently beneficent goals of restorative justice” (p.578) becomes vital.","Background. Restorative justice (RJ) practices have developed largely without careful consideration of their implications. Substituting “community” for “state” justice raises important issues. The most basic concern is obvious but sometimes ignored: Does the state -- or the community at large -- have an interest in ensuring that people who commit certain wrongs are punished? If crime control and punishment for offending are seen by members of the public as a state responsibility, what happens when a ‘crime’ is defined as the exclusive property of victims (perhaps broadly interpreted) and offenders? Clearly, the state has not pleased everyone in its control of crime and punishment. Issues of its legitimacy have been raised. Nevertheless, both public interest and human rights issues are part of the debate on state involvement in criminal justice., Restorative Justice approaches can be seen as sacrificing “the rule of law” and the values associated with it (e.g., consistency, impartiality, proportionality). One issue that arises when matters are turned over to the “community” is that RJ advocates have seldom addressed what is meant by the “community.” If a resolution has to be acceptable to the “community”, it would seem necessary to define those who constitute this collectivity. Victims’ interests in reparation are obvious. However, does a victim or a “community” have special powers over that which is defined as the “public interest” when dealing with an offender (e.g., through punishment or otherwise)? If “victim satisfaction” is a primary goal of RJ, it necessarily follows that proportional penalties are sacrificed. Further, matters such as proportionality or impartiality might be deemed irrelevant for an offender if he/she consents to a RJ procedure instead of a “normal” criminal justice procedure. However, is consent freely given if an offender contemplates harsher treatment because he/she rejects a RJ process? Should “one victim’s forgiveness of an offender [or] another’s desire for vengeance” (p.588) be relevant to the outcome of a case? These questions amongst others need to be addressed if RJ is going to become more closely associated with the justice system. Prejudices and inequalities are clearly not left at the doorstep of the RJ forum., Conclusion. It is argued that “a fundamental role of the state [is] to maintain a system for the administration of justice and to ensure that proper standards of procedural protection are applied” (p.590) (See Criminological Highlights  4(4), Item 1 for a related article). Values such as independent and impartial tribunals, proportionality, and human rights are central to the justice system (whether delivered or not) but largely irrelevant to RJ. “Too often… enthusiasm for… processes [such as restorative justice] leads proponents either to overlook the need for safeguards or to imply that they are not relevant” (p.591).  It is argued that “governments must retain a primary role [in criminal justice], and that the proper role of the victim in criminal justice processes should be reappraised” (p.591). Even though “most of those interested in promoting RJ seem to oppose penal severity… clear limits are important to prevent violations of rights behind a mask of benevolence…. The relationship between the formal system and any restorative justice processes must be carefully crafted so as avoid inequities” (p.592). Said differently, the ‘justice’ in RJ may need to be restored., Reference:  Ashworth, Andrew  (2002). Responsibilities, Rights, and Restorative Justice.

Poverty and delinquency are related. Children who experience long periods of poverty between birth and age 5 or in the early teenage years (ages 11-15) are more likely to engage in both property and violent offending.,", Background. Much of the research on poverty and delinquency does not show a simple connection between these two phenomena. Part of the explanation for these inconclusive results may be that researchers have tended to look for simultaneous effects: the impact of poverty at a particular time in a child’s life and delinquent behaviour at that same point in time. This approach may be problematic because it does not distinguish between more common short spells of poverty (under a year) and less frequent chronic poverty. Indeed, some studies have shown that as many as one-third of children experience poverty during at least one year of their lives, whereas only about one in twenty children experience ten or more years of poverty., This paper identifies youths growing up in persistent poverty as well as the time during their lives in which it occurred. Data are from an American longitudinal study of youths which followed a cohort of individuals from birth to age 10-15 (in 1992). Complete information about their household’s financial status from birth onward was available from annual interviews of their mothers. The sample tended to over-represent children born to mothers who were young, poor, and members of minority groups. Self-report delinquency data were obtained from the children., The findings suggest that chronic poverty is more important in understanding delinquency than is poverty at the time that delinquency is assessed. More interesting is the fact that “after controlling for persistent poverty [defined, in one analysis, as those who experienced poverty for 8 or more years], the cross-sectional measure of poverty status [at the time of the assessment of delinquency] was no longer related to delinquent involvement” (p.179). Long term poverty is clearly more serious in its effects than short term spells., The length of time in which a child experiences poverty is related to both property and violent offending, but not to the likelihood of committing status offences. However, the time at which a child experiences poverty also matters. Children who experience persistent poverty early in their lives (birth to age 5) or in adolescence (ages 11 to 15) are more likely to self-report delinquency than those of other age groups. Indeed, poverty experienced between ages 6 and 10 is unrelated to later delinquent behaviour., Conclusion. Growing up in a chronically poor household is clearly associated with youthful offending. These results are consistent with other research showing a relationship between welfare rates and crime (See Criminological Highlights, 1(5), Item 1 and 1(6), Item 4). The fact that both early chronic (ages 0-5) and late chronic (ages 11-15) poverty affect offending suggests that poverty may act through different mechanisms at these two developmental periods. For instance, poor prenatal and postnatal care as well as deficient nutrition in the earlier interval and lack of educational or employment opportunities in the latter period may constitute possible intervening variables. Whatever the mechanisms, growing up chronically poor clearly suggests a context of persistent disadvantage for the child. Unfortunately, it may only be at the moment in which the disadvantaged youth offends for the first time that the community becomes aware of the adverse effects of policies which permit chronic poverty., Reference: Jarjoura, G. Roger; Ruth A. Triplett, and Gregory P. Brinker (2002). Growing Up Poor: Examining the Link Between Persistent Childhood Poverty and Delinquency.

Drug testing of youthful offenders on parole may create more problems than it resolves.,", Background.  Drug testing might appear to some observers to be an obvious way of controlling drug use for those serving sentences in the community. However, its value has not been adequately examined. Given that a frequent condition of probation (or parole) is that offenders abstain from the use of drugs, it is important to assess the effects of such policies. One obvious problem is that drug testing changes the nature of the relationship between the offender and his/her supervisor. To the extent that a delicate balance exists between support and surveillance in the parole officer - offender relationship, “an over-reliance on testing may push the balance toward control” (p.219)., This study examined the impact of variations in the frequency of drug testing of youths who were under the control of the California Youth Authority. These young offenders had been released on parole from indeterminate custodial sentences. Most (88%) had been committed to custody for offences other than those related to drugs, with over half having been sentenced for a violent crime. They were randomly assigned to one of five conditions which varied in the frequency of drug testing from no routine testing to testing every week or two (though not necessarily at predictable intervals). Because of random assignment, the actual groups can be considered to be similar on all dimensions., The results are easy to summarize: There was no evidence that increased frequency of drug testing enhanced parole adjustment or reduced criminality (as measured by arrests). In fact, arrests during and after the parole period tended to be slightly higher for groups tested more often as part of this study (p.232). Said differently, frequent drug testing did not increase the likelihood that an offender would serve his or her parole period successfully, as opposed to being removed from parole because of a technical violation or a new criminal offence. Generally speaking, it appeared that parole officers were tolerant of positive drug tests up to the third positive test.  However, there were some negative impacts of positive drug tests:  one-fifth of parolees who tested positive “went AWOL…. They absconded rather than face the possible consequences of detected drug use” (p.236)., Conclusion.  “One of the main rationales for increased drug testing has been its assumed value for improving the behaviour of the offenders being tested…  The logic of drug testing as a tool for enhancing an agent’s ability to observe and respond to drug use would suggest its value for controlling drug use…  The present results suggest the need for a thorough review of this assumption…  This study provided experimental evidence that the variations in drug testing frequencies that can be implemented as part of regular parole did not produce expected behavioural differences among serious young offenders” (pp. 237-8). In fact, some evidence indicated that high levels of drug testing increased rather than decreased arrests for violent (and “total”) offences when these youths were followed for 42 months. In other words, interventions which are designed to decrease offending may, in fact, make things worse., Reference:  Haapanen, Rudy and Lee Britton (2002).

The manner in which prisons are run makes a difference: Case studies of two troubled correctional facilities demonstrate that “prison administrators and state and national governments can create the conditions under which social order breaks down or is restored” (p.499).,", Background.  Previous research (Criminological Highlights, 3(1), Item 2) suggests that the way in which prisons are managed can affect the likelihood that prison disorder will occur. This paper proposes a set of conditions that increase the likelihood of a prison riot: (1) external pressures (e.g., fiscal restraints, changes in the law) that the institution is incapable of addressing easily; (2) conflictual relationships between correctional staff and management; (3) inmate demands related to conditions that they believe to be unfair or worse than they should be; (4) inmate ideologies that support disruption (e.g., the conviction that only riots will attract outside attention to their grievances), and (5) actions of the prison administration which are perceived as unjust or ineffective., This paper examines changes in two prisons – New York City’s Rikers Island facility which holds approximately 20,000 inmates, and a New Mexico prison, with a capacity of about 1250 prisoners. The Rikers Island correctional complex had been in a continuous state of disorder from 1990 until a new administrator was hired in 1998. The incoming management could not be characterized as either permissive or strict. On the contrary, its approach appeared to attack the causes of the disturbances, rather than their symptoms (e.g., unrest). Said differently, it “(1) balanced resources and demands on the administration and ended conflict with the city; (2) created unity and coherence in policy among the warden and correctional staff; (3) increased safety for prisoners, curbing excessive use of force by staff while also providing security for corrections officers; (4) undercut the ‘Hobbesian’ ideology that justified rebellion, and (5) enforced swift and effective responses to inmate provocations” (p.504). Serious violence dropped dramatically at a time when resources to the prison were also reduced. Yet, the atmosphere was not permissive. In fact, inmate arrests increased significantly. However, this practice was coupled with an increase in perceived fairness by the prisoners. For instance, advance warning was given when rules were altered (e.g., the introduction of a ban on ‘gang-identifying jewelry’) and inmates were dealt with in a manner that they perceived as just., In contrast, New Mexico opened two new private prisons in 1998 as a means of reducing overcrowding.  Inexperienced, poorly paid ($8/hour) staff were worried about keeping their jobs. Moreover, conditions for prisoners were worse than those to which they had been accustomed (e.g., 2-person cells with no electrical outlets, lower wages for work than they had previously experienced) and inmates felt that they were being treated unfairly. For instance, the prison administration terminated what had been seen as Native American entitlements, given as a response to the over-representation of this minority group in the facility. In combination, these factors created the necessary conditions for disorder. Predictably, riots occurred., Conclusion. It would be wrong to see the reduction in New York of those factors associated with riots and their creation in New Mexico as being determined by differences in the degree of tolerance that prison management displayed vis-à-vis disorder. Rather, it appears that disorder is much more likely to be related to the ways in which the prison administration averts those conditions which increase the probability of riots. More specifically, “prison management must gain the loyalty of a professional staff and the compliance of a base population that is involuntarily placed in their care, while also coping with external demands and constraints” (p.519). “Neither demographic factors, nor reform policies, nor a lax or harsh style of management, have any particular advantages; what matters for good order are sound and coherent relationships among administrators, staff, base population, and the external community” (p.522). Interestingly, it would appear that private correctional facilities are less effective in achieving these goals., Reference: Useem, Bert and Jack A. Goldstone (2002).

"Children as young as 3 years old understand what it means to tell the truth or to lie. Like adults, they will sometimes lie to conceal their own transgressions. Yet, the child’s ability to demonstrate a conceptual understanding of lying does not predict whether the child will actually tell a lie.  However, getting children to promise to tell the truth reduces lying.",", Background. Child witnesses are often used in court cases. The doubt that arises is whether they understand the difference between telling lies and telling the truth. The problem is that children are generally able to give testimony in court only if they can provide appropriate answers to questions about the concepts of truth and lies as well as promise to tell the truth. Although previous studies tend to show that youths understand the notions of lying/truth-telling, research has not linked this conceptual comprehension to actual behaviour of telling lies/the truth., This study involved three experiments in which children were placed in a situation in which they could be tempted to lie. Children were told that they would get a prize if they guessed which toy they had heard making sounds in the room that they were in. They were warned that they couldn’t look, but were given an opportunity to “cheat.” Children were classified by observers into groups who “peeked” (cheated) and those who did not. The respondents were subsequently asked if they had peeked. In addition, the researchers also assessed the child’s conceptual understanding of what it means to tell a lie. In particular, children were told a story about a girl who had eaten candy after being told not to. The children were asked what they thought this girl should say when asked whether she had eaten the sweets. Further, they were told that the girl said she hadn’t eaten the candy. The children were subsequently questioned about whether the response of the lying girl was a lie or the truth and whether it was good/bad., The results of the three experiments were straightforward. Three-year-old “peekers” were considerably less likely to lie than were older children. Further, the older respondents were somewhat more likely to see the lying girl in the story as bad than were the younger ones. More important was the finding that although the majority of the children understood correctly what it meant to lie and that it was bad to lie, the level of understanding of the “meaning” of lying did not predict actual lying by the child. In the final experiment, instead of questioning children about what it meant to lie, half of the children were asked to promise to tell the truth. 75% of those who were simply asked a set of questions about truth telling lied. In comparison, only 59% of those who were asked to promise to tell the truth lied. Of course, there are currently no data to evaluate whether these proportions are any higher than they would be for adults., Conclusion. It appears that simply getting children to promise to tell the truth has a larger “truth telling” impact than discussions about the concept of lying and truth-telling. “The study failed to confirm the… legal assumption underlying the court competence examination that children who, understanding the concept and moral implications of truth- and lie-telling, are more likely to tell the truth than those who do not understand these concepts” (pp. 409-410). If anything, the results suggest that those who appear to fully understand the abstract concepts might be more likely to lie. These findings clearly “do not support the exclusion of children from testifying because they fail certain conceptual questions about lie- and truth-telling. The fact that a child understands lie- and truth-telling conceptually does not relate to his or her actual truthfulness. Thus using competence examinations to screen out children with limited understanding of lie- and truth-telling is problematic. Such a practice will prevent children who are able to give truthful and useful testimony from testifying” (pp. 411-412)., Reference: Talwar, Victoria; Kang Lee; Nicholas Bala, and R. C. L.

"Even rigid sentencing grids do not ensure that people of different racial backgrounds will be punished equally. “African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans receive relatively harsher sentences than whites…” (p.189) under the U.S. federal sentencing guidelines.",", Background. One of the purposes of a sentencing guideline system is to increase the likelihood that similar cases result in similar sentences. Whatever other concerns might have been expressed about the U.S. federal sentencing grid, the very narrow range of sanctions available for offence-criminal record combinations would appear to make sentencing rather mechanical. As a result, many observers believe that there is little room for discriminatory sentencing. Indeed, it has been assumed that racial discrimination – if it exists at all –  occurs primarily in charging decisions or in the relative severity of crimes associated with race (e.g., the dramatically higher sentences required for crack-cocaine versus pure cocaine offences)., The U.S. federal sentencing grid divides federal criminal cases into 43 types of offence and 6 gradations of offending history. Each of the 258 cells (formed by the combination of offence seriousness and criminal history) contains a range of legal guideline sentences. The top of the sentencing range in each of these cells is only 25% (or a minimum of 6 months) higher than the bottom of the range (e.g., a range of 32-40 months might be specified for a given offence-criminal history combination). Because departures from the guidelines are so restricted, “the key opportunity for judicial discretion is the decision of where [to sentence] within the determined [very narrow] range” (p.194). This study looks at the use of this restricted range as a function of the race of the offender., This study examined the relationship between the defendant’s race/ethnicity and the quartile within which his/her sentence fell (i.e. the first, second, third, or fourth quarter of the sentencing range under the U.S. federal sentencing guidelines). The overall distribution of sentences within the restricted available range is interesting in and of itself: the majority of sentences (64%) were in the bottom quarter while 21% were in the top quartile. Only 15% were in the middle two quarters (combined)., The results demonstrate that African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans are more likely than whites to receive sentences in the top quarter of the range. These findings held true even after the researchers statistically controlled for a large number of additional factors. More specifically, the effects of such variables as criminal record, type and seriousness of crime, whether the offender pleaded guilty or had a full trial and whether the offender explicitly took responsibility for the offence as well as the offender’s level of education, gender, age, and the region in the U.S. in which he/she was sentenced were held constant and not found to explain the effect of race. In addition to this finding, the U.S. federal guidelines also permitted an examination of other determinants. For instance, it was found that:, Conclusion: It might have been assumed that the apparent sentencing differences between whites, on the one hand, and African American, Hispanics, and Native Americans on the other could be due to differences in the offences of which they are convicted. However, “race/ethnicity differences [in sentencing] are not explained wholly by offence-related characteristics” (p.206). Moreover, the effects of other factors related to the sentence but unrelated to offence seriousness and criminal record (e.g., whether the accused pleaded guilty, the offender’s age and education, etc.) raise serious doubts about the assumption that even rigid sentencing guidelines eliminate or reduce unfairness in sentencing., Reference: Everett, Ronald S. and Roger A.

"Being imprisoned has a permanent effect on wages: those who have been incarcerated are likely not only to have reduced wage income, but the effect of imprisonment increases as workers get older. Hence, the increase in wages that ex-offenders experience as they age is smaller than that earned by non-offenders.",", Background. It is well accepted that there is increasing wage disparity in the U.S. This study examines the extent to which U.S. income disparity is exacerbated by imprisonment policies. Indeed, incarceration may be expected to have a long term impact on a person’s wages for a number of reasons. For instance, the stigma of imprisonment, the lack of job skills acquired while incarcerated, the debilitating effects of prison on physical and mental health, and the nature of those with whom the prisoner is in social contact while in custody can negatively affect subsequent wage income., This study takes advantage of a remarkable finding: the data from the U.S. National Longitudinal Study of Youth on survey respondents’ residence includes whether he/she was in prison. In 1998, 3.2% of the interviews of males between the ages of 14-21 were carried out while the respondent was incarcerated. This incidence is clearly the result of U.S. imprisonment policy. Indeed, studies have shown that 7.8% of all American males have been imprisoned at least once by age 40. The comparable figure for black males is 27%. In fact, it was found that “more black male high school dropouts [in the U.S.] age 20 to 35 were in custody than in paid employment” (p.526) on an average day in 1996., The results show that “incarceration eliminates all wage growth among ex-convicts” (p.536). Further, “[t]he wage gap between nonconvicts and ex-convicts grows as convicts age” (p.538). This is particularly interesting because the effect of incarceration on whether the ex-convict is employed decreases over time. In other words, it would seem that ex-convicts are eventually able to find jobs. However, these jobs offer little opportunity for wage growth. In addition, “[t]he effect of incarceration on [wage] inequality is twice as large for blacks and Hispanics [as it is for whites]” (p.540)., Conclusion: “Incarceration is a turning point that reduces the earnings mobility of young men” (p.541). Indeed, “[t]here is strong evidence that incarceration reduces the wages of ex-inmates by 10-20 percent… [as well as their] rate of wage growth by about 30 percent” (p.541). This finding is particularly disconcerting when one recalls that “research relating crime to labour market outcomes views stable employment as an important source of criminal desistance… These effects appear strongest for men in their late 20s and 30s… The low wages earned by ex-inmates may thus be associated with further crime after release from prison. The causal path from incarceration to irregular employment to crime may be especially damaging because the economic pain of incarceration is largest for older men – precisely the group that benefits from stable employment” (p.542). Moreover, the impact on racial inequality cannot be ignored. “By the 1990s, around one-fifth of minority men and a comparable proportion of those with only a high school education will pass through prison at some point in their lives. Under these conditions, it appears that the U.S. penal system has grown beyond disciplining the deviant few, to imposing a systemic influence on broad patterns of inequality” (p.542)., Reference: Western, Bruce (2002).

"The nature and timing of a broken home affects the relationship between family structure and delinquency. Moreover, the impact of family structure on delinquent behaviour appears to be mediated by other factors (e.g., association with deviant peers).",", Background.  Being from a “broken home” has been known to be associated with delinquency for decades. However, one difficulty with previous research is that little is known about the mechanisms which account for these effects. Similarly, the timing and nature of the separation is not adequately understood. Finally, to talk about “delinquency” in this context assumes that the impact of a broken home and the mechanisms by which the disruption has its effects are the same for all types of delinquency., This study examined a number of different kinds of living circumstances for adolescents in a three-year longitudinal study. “Broken” homes were divided into a number of distinct types  – e.g., those in which the separation/divorce took place at least three years before the final measure of delinquency, those in which a divorce/separation had recently transpired, and those in which a remarriage had recently occurred., The difficulty in interpreting the results is demonstrated by findings which suggest that family structure is associated - in complex ways - with several other factors known to be related to delinquency (e.g., level of involvement of the child with the family, views concerning whether certain delinquent behaviours are wrong, association with delinquent peers, etc.)., The results tend to show that the effect of growing up in a broken family is mediated by other associated risks. 
Early divorce/separation is associated with property offending. However, this relationship is no longer statistically significant (p.123) after the effects of other factors such as parental abuse, beliefs about whether delinquent acts are wrong, and association with delinquent peers are removed.
Early divorce/separation and the presence of a stepparent in the home early in life are both associated with violent offending (p.126). However, these effects disappear when the impact of other factors such as the strength of the youth’s commitment to conventional institutions (e.g., education and family) and association with delinquent peers are held constant.
In contrast, the impact of a recent remarriage of the parent on status offences (e.g., running away, lying about age, cheating on tests) appears to remain even after various other factors are taken into account (p.120)., Conclusion. It appears that some, but not necessarily all, of the impact of broken homes is mediated by other variables such as association with delinquent peers and attachment to conventional values. Nevertheless, it seems that at least for status offences, family structure (recent appearance in the family of a stepparent) has an effect on (short term) misbehaviour. Like other research (See Criminological Highlights,4(2), Item 5) this study suggests that to the extent that single-parent families are likely to be associated with elevated levels of delinquency, a policy focus on the mechanisms for such an effect is likely to be more effective than are nostalgic calls for conventional family structures., Reference: Rebellon, Cesar J.

Sex offender registries and community notification of the presence of a convicted sex offender in a particular neighbourhood are of questionable value.,"Background. Members of the public and politicians alike are constantly on the lookout for the silver bullet that will deal a deadly blow to serious crime. Sex offender registries and community notification systems have recently been heralded as the panacea for sexual offences (especially against children). This positive assessment is held in spite of research which has shown that reoffending rates for this type of crime are low (see Criminological Highlights, 5(1)#4, and 3(3)#3) and that even with properly functioning notification systems, almost no sex offences would be averted (Criminological Highlights, 4(1)#2). Currently, registries have been established in all 51 U.S. jurisdictions (References #1,4,5) and have begun to be implemented in Canada as well. Notification is also allowed under certain provincial laws (Reference #4, pp.136-7). Despite this extensive adoption, the debate over the value of these strategies has yet to be resolved., These papers present arguments both in favour of and against the use of sex offender registries. More specifically, several of the identified virtues of this criminal justice approach are as follows:
By making names public, practices such as those which occurred within the Catholic Church over the past several years of simply moving offending priests from one location to another may be discouraged (Reference #3).
No “cure” is perfect for all offenders (Reference #3).
The harassment of identified sex offenders in the community is relatively low (3.5%) (Reference #3). 
Registries and notification give parents an opportunity to protect their children (Reference #3)., The difficulties with the registry-notification approach appear to include the following:
The registries are incomplete. A U.S. survey showed that only 32 of 51 jurisdictions were able to provide “failure to register” statistics. Further, the overall ‘failure’ rate for these 32 jurisdictions was 24%, with that of some states (e.g., California) being even higher (44%) (Reference #1).
These registries give an illusion of safety by implicitly communicating the (erroneous) idea that all sex offenders are known and that this type of crime is more likely to be committed by strangers than by trusted others (References #2&4). As such, these registries may be used simply “to appease the fears of the average citizen” (Reference #4, p.155). 
Sex offender registries may interfere with rehabilitation and reintegration (References #2&4). For example, one study (Reference #5) of sex offenders who had been subject to registration, news media releases, flyers and/or community notification meetings showed that 83% of the sample had not been allowed to rent residences and 77% had been ostracized by neighbours or acquaintances. 
Sex offender registries may drive offenders underground (Reference #2). Aside from anything else, registration systems are seen by many registered offenders (57% in the survey reported in Reference #5) as being responsible for loss of employment.
Registries and notification systems have been known to promote vigilantism. In a study of registered sex offenders (Reference #5), 77% of those surveyed had received threats or had been subject to harassment while 3% had received vigilante attacks. Further, almost all registered sex offenders reported fear for their safety. These risks are even more problematic when one recalls that the information in the registries may be inaccurate. In these cases, non-offenders may be targeted because they live at an address that has incorrectly been identified as that of an ex-offender (Reference #4).   
Costs of registry systems are considerable. Further, law enforcement agencies are typically not given additional resources for implementing and updating these registries (Reference #5, pp. 377-8). 
Registry and notification can also lead to collateral harm to the family members of those subject to them (Reference #5, pp. 382-4)., Conclusion. Clearly, registries and notification systems are not without their own problems and, as such, demand careful scrutiny before being implemented. This warning gains even more salience when one recognizes that their proclaimed benefits have yet to receive empirical support. Within this context, it would seem particularly important to consider the non-trivial costs of these approaches to public safety in light of the opportunity costs – that is, alternative avenues to crime prevention that are ignored because of a focus on these largely untested strategies., References: (1) Survey Finds Large Gaps in Megan’s Law Enforcement.

"Hung juries are not random events. Rather, they occur with some predictability.",", Background.  America’s best known jury scholar - Hans Zeisel - once described the hung jury as a “treasured but paradoxical phenomenon” (p.33). More specifically, the hung jury reflects the law’s deep respect for minority perspectives, but can only exist if it occurs infrequently. If there were large numbers of hung juries, changes would be made (e.g., allowing majority verdicts rather than requiring unanimous verdicts) to eliminate this possible outcome. Kalven and Zeisel’s seminal work, The American Jury (1966), set out to describe the circumstances under which it does, in fact, happen. Their data suggest that hung juries were considerably more likely to occur in cases in which judges indicated that it was not clear from the evidence whether defendants were guilty or innocent. It was also found that for most hung juries, the majority of jurors favoured conviction. Similarly, their findings suggested that the judge would have convicted in the majority of cases in which the jury was, in fact, hung. Further, 42% of hung juries had only one or two holdout jurors. However, it was also shown that the first-ballot votes of those juries which were unable to ultimately come to a verdict initially had substantial splits of opinion., More recently, it has been demonstrated that there is enormous variability across jurisdictions in the U.S. in hung jury rates, varying from 0.1% to 14.8% in one study. Juries were more likely to hang on all counts when the defendant was charged with few offences. Moreover, hung juries were more probable when a large proportion of the jurors had prior jury service. However, the likelihood of coming to a verdict did not relate to the demographic characteristics of the jury., In addition, the complexity of the evidence in the case was found to be important. Jurors from cases which hung on at least one charge were more likely than those from cases which went to verdict to rate the evidence as complex and difficult to understand. This same relationship existed with regard to jurors’ appraisals of the intricacies both of expert witnesses and of the instructions that they received from judges. In contrast, the ratings by judges and lawyers of these same elements in cases where there was a verdict and those where there was a hung jury did not differ. Similar to earlier studies, more recent research also suggests that hung juries are most likely to occur in cases in which the jury is fairly evenly split on the verdict at the time of the initial vote., Theories suggesting that “increasing diversity [within a jury] makes it more difficult for jurors to agree were not [supported] in the [most recent] study [of hung juries]” (p.49). If the number of hung juries has, in fact, increased, it would appear to be the result of “practices that are within the purview of the prosecution, such as bringing cases with relatively ambiguous evidence to trial, and charging multiple counts, [which] appear to be stronger factors that increase the likelihood of a hung jury [on any given count]” (p.49). The evidence suggests that juries that are allowed majority (non-unanimous) verdicts do not deliberate as fully as those required to come to a unanimous verdict. The study showed that in a small number of juries, the final unanimous verdict was in the opposite direction of that held by a strong majority in the initial vote., Conclusion. It would seem that findings from recent research confirm – to a great extent – the conclusions drawn by Kalven and Zeisel on American juries in the 1950s. In particular, approaches that make the evidence, expert testimony, and judges’ instructions more understandable and accessible to the jury might still be good places to start when attempting to reduce the occurrence of hung juries., Reference: Hans, Valerie P., Paula L.

"Young children (ages 12-13) are more likely than older youths and young adults to take responsibility for transgressions that they did not, in fact, commit",", Background.  It is well established that people being interrogated by the police will occasionally take responsibility for acts that - it is later shown - they did not do. While people have “often pondered how or why a person would confess to a crime that he/she did not commit” (p.142), it is clear that external forces in the police interrogation setting are often at least partially responsible. The data on false confessions in criminal cases suggest that two factors are responsible for this phenomenon: the vulnerability of the suspect and the presentation of false evidence by an interrogator., This study used youths aged 12-13 and 15-16, as well as young adults (mean age of 20)  in a laboratory experiment in which they were asked to respond to certain stimuli. They were told not to hit a certain key on the keyboard because this action - they were told - would crash the computer and cause a loss of data. Unbeknownst to them, the computer was programmed to crash automatically during the study.  At this point, half of the participants were presented with (false) computer generated evidence that they had, in fact, pressed the forbidden key. Participants were subsequently asked to take responsibility for the computer crash by signing a statement confessing to the ‘crime’. In doing so, they assumed responsibility for hitting the key and agreed to work for 10 hours re-entering the data that had supposedly been lost by their alleged error., The results suggested that approximately ¾ of the youths of “young offender” age confessed to the transgression that they had not, in fact, committed whereas only 59% of the young adults took responsibility for the act. The presentation of false evidence had a dramatic impact on the likelihood that 15-16 year olds would confess (increasing the rate from 56% to 88%) but did not have a significant effect on the other age groups. The study also found that the more ‘suggestible’ participants (i.e. those individuals with a tendency to demonstrate compliance with the suggestions of others) were more likely to take responsibility for acts they had not committed., Conclusion. The high rate of false confessions among youths in this study indicates the need - as exists in Canadian youth justice legislation - for special safeguards for young offenders when considering their confessions. It appears that young children are obedient to authority figures – police officers in interrogations and experimenters in the research setting. Obedience, when a suggestion is made that the accused did something he or she did not do, can, therefore, lead to a false confession being given.  Given that so-called experts on police interrogation argue that similar techniques for extracting a confession should be used with youths as with adults, these results suggest that there should be heightened concern whenever a youth confesses to a crime., Reference:  Redlich, Allison D. and Gail S. Goodman. (2003). Taking Responsibility for an Act Not Committed: The Influence of Age and Suggestibility.

Do it right or don’t do it at all: Programs and services designed to reduce domestic violence do so only if they are adequately implemented.,", Background. Rates of homicides involving intimate partners in the U.S. have decreased over the past 25 years even though the overall homicide levels have shown a considerably different pattern. Some have argued that increased resources for victims of domestic violence (e.g., hotlines, shelters) have been at least partially responsible for this decline. Indeed, the theory underlying this explanation is that “policies, programs, and services that effectively reduce contact between intimate partners reduce the opportunity for abuse and violence” (p.170).  However, it is equally possible that these programs could also create a retaliation effect. More specifically, domestic violence resources could, in fact, increase interpersonal homicide if they added to “the level of stress or conflict in the relationship without effectively reducing victim exposure” (p.170)., This study assesses these two competing hypotheses by examining the effect of a broad range of domestic violence resources on interpersonal homicides between 1976 and 1996 in 48 large U.S. cities. The primary focus is on the presence of policies related to situations in which protection orders are violated. In addition, various other policies were assessed. A total of twelve victim types (i.e. combinations by sex, race - African-American, white or all victims – and marital status – married or unmarried) were examined., The results were presented in such a manner that only the most robust findings (as defined by the authors) were accepted as true. This study uncovered partial support for both hypotheses. With regard to the ‘reduced opportunity’ theory, this study found that “[m]ore aggressive arrest policy is associated with fewer killings of unmarried intimates” (p.191). Similarly, the adoption of mandatory arrest laws (for those who violate protection orders) “is associated with fewer deaths of married women of all races…” (p.192). However, polices often appeared to affect different groups (e.g., unmarried vs. married, certain racial groups) in diverse ways. Finally, other non-criminal justice strategies which might indirectly affect victim exposure were also found to have an impact on domestic violence. For instance, a decline in welfare rates (i.e. aid to families with dependent children) was related to an increase in the homicide victimization of unmarried men – especially African-Americans (p.191). In contrast, some support for the retaliation theory was also evident.  In particular, the willingness of prosecutors to take on cases of protection order violations was associated with a rise in homicides for most groups when adequate protection was not provided., Conclusion. Based on the results of this study, the challenge is clearly “to specify the conditions under which exposure-reducing opportunity and retaliation-inducing motivation [might] occur” (p.194). “These findings do not mean that designing prevention strategies based on exposure reduction is a bad idea. They do, however, suggest that a little exposure reduction (or unmet promises of exposure reduction) in severely violent relationships can be worse than the status quo. Absolute reduction of exposure in such relationships is an important policy objective. But achieving this type of protection from abuse is not easy” (p.194). In addition, it seems important to recognize that policies which have an impact on one subset of potential victims may have different impacts on others., Reference:  Dugan, Laura, Daniel S.

"Regulatory standards matter in explaining corporate environmental behaviour but they aren’t everything. Indeed, economic factors, management style, and public pressure on industry from local community and activist groups push companies beyond mere compliance with the law.",", Background.  Many companies operate “beyond compliance” with regulatory requirements, suggesting that compliance is more complex than simply establishing and enforcing regulations.  In order to understand environmental performance, it is necessary to look further than the traditional uni-dimensional legalistic perspective to economic variables, political and social pressures, and corporate cultures., This paper examines the control of water pollution in 14 pulp and paper mills in four countries (U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand).  Over the past few decades, pulp and paper pollution has generally decreased. However, notwithstanding the fact that the mills in the U.S. have been subject to more costly and punitive lawsuits than those elsewhere – a phenomenon described as an “enforcement frenzy” in contrast with Canada’s “partnering approach” (p.63) – this study found “no consistent differences among regulatory jurisdictions in the environmental performance of [the various] pulp mills” (p.63). In fact, the variation within a jurisdiction was demonstrated to be as large as the variation across jurisdictions. While there was some evidence that regulatory regimes matter (e.g., when there was a requirement that particular pollutants be eliminated by a certain date), variation in these standards was not sufficient to explain differences., Beyond legalistic factors, corporation size was not found to be significant in explaining variation in compliance, though the companies with larger profit margins generally had lower rates of pollution (p.67). In contrast, social variables emerged as important predictors of compliance. Indeed, mill managers reported “significant environmental pressures” (p.69) from their host communities, and were very conscious of “anything that can give you a bad name” (p.69). Similarly, pressure from customers had an impact on some mills. Differences were also detected with regard to management style. Based on qualitative data, this variable was assessed from interviews with managers which queried their attitudes concerning environmental issues as well as their explanations for various actions that they had taken. Each mill’s type of environmental management was subsequently categorized as being either a true believer, an environmental strategist, a committed complier, or a reluctant complier. The first two classifications described those plants which saw value in investments in environmental performance, and in searching for measures which would reduce pollution and cut costs. Not surprisingly, the mills with these management styles also tended to pollute less., Conclusion. “Theories of corporate environmental behaviour that focus on a single variable – whether legal, economic, or attitudinal – are almost always doomed to be incomplete and inadequate” (p.76). Environmental performance is more likely to be shaped by interactions among two sets of variables: legal, economic, and social/political, on the one hand, and corporate management attitudes, on the other. Further, while regulatory requirements appear to set the benchmark for enforcers, other factors seem to be important in explaining variation in how far corporations operated “beyond compliance” (p.83). Indeed, “social license pressures and the character of corporate environmental management appear to be the most powerful factors that prod some firms further beyond compliance than others” (p.83) while “economic pressures limit how far even the most environmentally committed firm can leap ahead of its competitors” (p.83)., Reference: Kagan, Robert A., Neil Gunningham, and Dorothy Thornton.

"Although it is sometimes argued that youth crime has become dramatically more serious than it was when separate youth justice systems were first established in North America,  the original juvenile courts were, in fact, established to respond effectively to serious and violent young offenders.",", Background.  Since the early 1990s, there has been concern that young offenders have become a “new breed” who are best described as “juvenile superpredators” or as “remorseless and morally impoverished” (p.642). As a consequence, most U.S. states have made it easier to prosecute youths as adults. This practice is largely based on the argument that the juvenile system was not designed to deal with these serious offenders. As one prosecutor put it, “Our juvenile criminal act was written at a time when kids were knocking over outhouses, not killing people” (p.641). The result is not only that youths are prosecuted as adults in numbers unimagined a few decades ago, but the confidentiality of records and proceedings in the U.S. has also dramatically declined., This paper challenges the view that “once upon a time” youths only committed minor, annoying offences and, by extension, that the juvenile courts were unprepared to respond to violent offenders. Indeed, some newspaper stories of serious crimes in the early 20th century “made it sound as if one of today’s so-called ‘superpredators’ had been transported back in time” (p.655). For instance, one accused juvenile killer was described as “terrorizing a whole… settlement” (p.655)., The historical data collected for this research demonstrate that the first U.S. juvenile court in Illinois was designed, in fact, to hear all cases involving juvenile offenders. All boys under 17 and all girls under 18 were under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court in 1905. Therefore, this Chicago court was clearly hearing homicide cases in the early 1920s. Presumably these offences had not been “pleaded down” from charges involving overturned outhouses. It was clear that an informal understanding existed regarding which cases could be handled in adult court. Only a small number (estimated at 0.6%) of cases - largely constituting repeat offenders (all of whom were over the age of 16) – were transferred to adult court., One of the central changes that occurred since the early days of the juvenile court and which accelerated in the last decade of the 20th century was the use of adult court to try youths. This practice was largely a result of both legislative decisions to exclude certain types of cases from juvenile court and laws which allowed prosecutors to avoid juvenile court if they so desired. Indeed, juvenile court judges are not – to a significant degree - responsible for decisions on whether a youth will be tried in adult court. For example, Florida - with a population of approximately 16 million - has roughly 7000 youths prosecuted in adult court as a result of prosecutorial decisions. In comparison, Canada - with a population of about 31 million - transferred a total of 41 cases to adult court in 2000/1., Conclusion. “The 20th century has witnessed a transformation in the legal response to juvenile homicide [in the U.S.]. The flexible system that often protected children [including homicide offenders] from being prosecuted as adults in the early 20th century has been replaced over time” (p.689). This paper suggests that the rehabilitative ideal has been replaced with punitive procedures. Indeed, “Whereas youth had been a mitigating factor in juvenile homicide cases in the early 20th century, it had become a legal liability by century’s end” (p.689)., Reference: Tanenhaus, David S. and Steven A.

"The substantial increase in the imprisonment rate in the Republic of Ireland during the last decade of the 20th century was not the result of a rise in the crime rate. Rather, it would appear to reflect new ‘law and order’ politics.",", Background.  The reported crime rate in the Republic of Ireland was fairly stable from the 1920s until the 1960s as was the case in Canada. From the mid-1960s to approximately 1980, the level of reported indictable offences increased significantly in both countries. However, imprisonment rates in Ireland – unlike those in Canada which have been relatively stable for years –  rose dramatically at the end of the 20th century at a time when crime rates were, if anything, decreasing. This divergence appears to coincide with a sudden change in public perception of crime in the Republic of Ireland. In 1980 and again in 1988 and 1994, survey data showed that crime was seen as the most important problem facing the Irish nation by only 2% - 8% of the population. In contrast, survey data from 1996 showed that 50% identified law and order as the most critical issue facing the government., This paper suggests that changes in the criminal justice climate in Ireland resulting from two killings within two weeks of each other in 1996  (one of a police officer and one of a journalist) set the stage for a significant shift in penal policy. In response to a ‘moral panic’ that followed these murders, a special parliamentary debate on crime was held. It was felt that new legislation was the “solution” to the recent crime problem. In fact, the opposition justice critic described the country as being “under threat” (p.48), and “law and order were key issues [in the 1997 general election, with] politicians engaged in a frenzied bidding war, promising more [police], more prisons and less tolerance” (p.49).  Borrowed from New York, zero tolerance - defined as “no crime, no matter how small, is insignificant” (p.49) - and the building of new prisons constituted the official crime policy of the opposition. Importantly, when this party formed the new government, this “commitment to zero tolerance never varied” (p.52).  In particular, action against beggars and other “public order” offences increased dramatically. In addition, the prison population increased by 39% between 1995 and 2000, resulting in an imprisonment rate per 1000 reported crimes which was twice that of Canada. Although the other main party has not attempted to “out-tough” (p.56) the party in power, dissenting voices on crime policy have been “silenced or ignored” (p.56). Although a parliamentary committee recommended that there be a “fundamental reappraisal of the role of the prison” (p.56), little actual change has occurred., Conclusion. At a time of falling crime rates, there appears to be a consolidation of the prison “at the hub of the criminal justice system” (p.57) in the Republic of Ireland. This recent phenomenon seems to be associated with the institution of a pro-imprisonment and zero-tolerance policy toward crime by the government. Despite this hard-line rhetoric though, a set of inherent contradictions are evident. The public has not completely fallen for this ‘law and order’ approach: in a recent referendum, 62% voted for ensuring that capital punishment could not be reintroduced under any circumstances. Similarly, there was never a decline in support of rehabilitation in prison, and detention is set out as a last resort for young offenders in 2001 legislation. Like Canada, Ireland does not appear to have a simple ‘culture of control’ that many scholars claim characterizes the U.S. and, to some extent, Great Britain (see Criminological Highlights, Volume 3, Number 5, Item 4)., Reference: O’Donnell, Ian and Eoin O’Sullivan.

"In deciding how to respond to “community policing,” police officers are guided more by what they think their supervisors’ attitudes are than by either their own attitudes or their supervisors’ actual attitudes.",", Background.  Police officers’ behaviour is often described as being “shaped by their occupational outlooks” (p.133). Nevertheless, most research has found that the relationship between officers’ attitudes and their actions is weak. These findings suggest that there is something about the nature of the occupational climate in policing that is important in understanding how police officers carry out their jobs. The implementation of community policing provides an opportunity to assess the importance of attitudes and values in determining the ways in which police act. Community policing – operationalized as the identification and understanding of problems and the search for their solutions – is considerably different from traditional policing (e.g., enforcing laws or stopping and interrogating citizens)., This study examined the attitudes of 243 police officers in two police departments who were observed during a total of 577 normal shifts. These officers were supervised by 70 different senior officers. The main measure used in this research was the percentage of an officer’s shift that was spent in problem solving policing (e.g., implementing a long term plan or project or identifying - or attempting to solve or prevent - the occurrence or recurrence of a problem). On average, police officers spent about 10% of their time on these activities. Officers’ orientation toward problem solving was assessed by asking them how often they should be expected to work on this type of policing. Their priorities for problem solving were measured by their choice of activities which they thought were most important., The findings suggest that the individual characteristics of police officers were not particularly important in understanding the amount of time that officers spent on conducting problem solving policing. However, female officers and those with fewer years of experience were found to spend more time in these activities. More interesting is the finding that police officers’ perceptions of their supervisors’ priorities affects the time that they spend on problem solving. Those who think that their supervisors place a priority on this type of policing are more likely to spend time problem solving themselves. Police officers’ own views of these activities did not predict problem solving policing above and beyond their view of their supervisors’ priorities. Similarly, the supervisor’s actual attitudes were not important in understanding the time spent on problem solving. Interestingly, the officers’ own views of this type of policing correlated with their perceptions of their supervisors’ attitudes., Conclusion. Clearly, the amount of time police officers spend on problem solving is affected by what the senior police officer communicates to his/her subordinates. More specifically, “It is…quite telling that the officers for whom problem solving is a high priority spend more time on problem solving to the extent that they perceive – in many instances erroneously – it is a priority for their supervisors” (p.158). “Officers whose supervisors espouse community policing and problem solving goals engage in no more problem solving than other officers. Interestingly, however, this appears to be due… to a failure of these supervisors to communicate their expectations, inspire their subordinates to practice problems solving and facilitate their efforts to do so…. Officers’ perceptions of their supervisors’ goals did not correspond to supervisors' actual goals” (pp. 158-9)., Reference: Engel, Robin Shepard and Robert E. Worden. (2003).

Successful transition from the prison to the community requires a great deal more than simply providing inmates with rehabilitative programs.,"Background. Most prisoners are eventually released into the community. For example, it is estimated that approximately 600,000 inmates were released in 2002 from U.S. state and federal prisons, as well as hundreds of thousands from local jails. Given the magnitude of these numbers, it is not surprising that the reintegrative process has been the focus of considerable scholarly attention. In particular, four dimensions have been identified as fundamental in understanding the determinants of successful re-entry: individual characteristics, family relationships, community contexts, and state policies (e.g., those related to support for the homeless, the unemployed and the families of prisoners). A holistic approach seems advisable as it encourages consideration of the prisoner’s circumstances at four distinct stages of his/her life: before incarceration, in prison, during the transitional period, and after the offender is in the community. A disregard for these various “dimensions” or “stages” may lead to an impoverished understanding of the reentry process and, as such, reduce the opportunities for achieving successful reintegration., This study reviews various influences on the success of the transition from prison to the community. In particular, it noted the following:, Conclusion.  A sole focus on individual characteristics of the offender and treatment while in prison does not permit a “more complex understanding of the milestones in the reintegration process” (p.107). Indeed, such factors as employment and good relationships with family and others in the community emerge as central to the inmate’s successful transition and, as such, are important dimensions in explaining recidivism. In fact, attention to the period following incarceration may be at least as crucial to our understanding of re-offending behaviour as a focus on offenders’ individual characteristics and their experience of prison., Reference: Visher, Christy A. and Jeremy Travis (2003). Transitions from Prison to Community: Understanding Individual Pathways. Annual Review of Sociology, 29, 89-113., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV6N1.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-6-no-1-%E2%80%93-october-2003,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 6, No. 1 – October 2003",Regular Issue,2003
"The ability to live free of crime after being released from prison is difficult. Those who re-offend tend to have an accumulation of welfare-related problems (e.g., lack of education, employment, financial resources, housing) which significantly reduce their likelihood of successful reintegration.",", Background. While successful re-entry into society is determined by a complex set of variables (see, for instance, Criminological Highlights, Volume 6 (1), Item 1), much of the recidivism research to date has focused on individual characteristics. In particular, studies have examined the relationship between re-offending and the situation in which the offender finds him/herself once released. Indeed, recidivism studies typically show that most of those who re-offend do so within the first few years of being released, suggesting that human resources play a central role in successful reintegration.  
 
This study examines re-offending in a group of Swedish inmates released from prison as a function of various deficiencies that existed in their living conditions prior to incarceration. It is reasonable to expect that these resources - upon release - would be related to their situation before imprisonment. Seven possible resource deficiencies were assessed for each prisoner: education, employment, financial situation, housing, social/family relations, health, and exposure to violence., The results suggest that educational deficiencies, unemployment, poverty, and homelessness were each associated (individually) with re-offending after release. Being young, using drugs before imprisonment, having predominantly criminal friends prior to incarceration, and the number of previous prison terms were also clearly related - on their own - to recidivism., However, the effects of combinations of these resource deficiencies were even more impressive. Generally speaking, the more deficits that the inmate exhibited, the more likely he or she was to re-offend. In fact, when these indices of social deficiencies were examined more carefully, it appeared that an index composed of employment, financial situation, homelessness, substance abuse, and social relations (i.e. measured by the number of visits that the inmate received during the three months prior to being interviewed in prison) was even more predictive of recidivism. While only 22% of those without any of these factors re-offended, 88% of those with all five deficits were found to recidivate. Further, recidivism increased with the addition of each deficit (1 deficit: 30%; two: 42%; three: 56%; four: 64%)., Conclusion. The finding that resource and welfare deficiencies are related to re-offending is encouraging in that these deficits can be altered by policy decisions surrounding welfare programs generally and/or programs focused more on individual inmates. Indeed, if recidivism by prisoners is caused, in part, by social welfare deficiencies, it becomes a straightforward question of public policy whether a community wants to invest resources into reducing re-offending by ex-inmates., Reference: Nilsson, Anders (2003).

"The factors which explain differences in fighting among youths from diverse racial/ethnic groups vary with the particular groups that are being compared. Nevertheless, differences among groups disappear, to a large extent, when various measures of social-economic disadvantage are taken into account.",", Background. Given the association between physical fights and involvement in violent crime by youth, it is not surprising that adolescent fighting has emerged as a central topic of academic inquiry. However, it has also been shown that significant differences exist among adolescent groups in the likelihood of engaging in fights. In particular, a national study of American youth found that the amount of self-reported participation in school-related physical fights in the previous year was higher among Blacks (21%), Latinos (18%) and American Indians (31%) than for Whites (13%) or Asians (11%)., This study examines the factors which might explain these group differences. Independent of all other dimensions, it was shown that the youths most likely to be involved in fighting were male, those who thought that fighting was OK, those reporting that they had recently used drugs or alcohol, and those with low school grades. In addition, adolescents whose parents knew the parents of their friends (a measure, perhaps, of the strength of the youth’s community) and youths who frequently interacted with adults were less likely to participate in physical fights., The most interesting findings relate to the factors that “explain away” the differences among groups. If one statistically removes the impact of living in a community with a high concentration of disadvantaged families, the difference in levels of fighting between black and white youths disappears. In other words, it seems that the different level of involvement in fighting by black and white youths is accounted for by the fact that black youths are considerably more likely to live in poor communities. Similarly, the difference between white and Latino youths disappears when one controls for a measure of family disadvantage -- the educational level of the adolescent’s parents. Said differently, the lower levels of education of parents of Latino youths explain the difference between Latino and white youths in their involvement in fighting., Interestingly, the researchers were not able to explain the difference in the level of fighting between white and American Indian youths. Neither the factors that accounted for white-Latino differences nor those explaining white-black differences were able to explain the dissimilar levels of fighting of these two diverse racial/ethnic groups. While curious, it is possible that this study simply did not include relevant measures of the differences between these adolescents in terms of their personal, social, and/or cultural circumstances., Conclusion. The differences in levels of fighting between white and Asian youths,  on the one hand,  and the higher rates of fighting involving black and Latino youths, on the other hand, can be understood by examining (or controlling for) certain basic social factors such as economic or family disadvantage. Whether as-yet unmeasured cultural disadvantages or other differences between American Indian and white youths would explain the higher rate of fighting by the former group still remains to be adequately tested., Reference:  McNulty, Thomas L. and Paul E.

"Probation should be understood as a form of constructive punishment instead of an alternative to punishment. In this context, probation officers would play a crucial role not only in administering the sentence but also in rehabilitating the offender by encouraging him/her to accept responsibility for the offence.",", Background.  In penal systems that appear to be simultaneously embracing proportional punitiveness and restorative justice, the obvious question which arises is the place of probation within this new world of sentencing. Indeed, probation services (other than the “tail ‘em, nail ‘em, and jail ‘em” services of some U.S. states) have resisted seeing probation as a punishment, preferring to conceptualize it within its historically moralistic or rehabilitative paradigm., This paper begins by arguing for an expanded notion of punishment which would include the values of respect and concern for both the victim and the offender. In this way, an exclusively retributive or punitive conception of punishment is avoided. Within this framework, it is suggested that probation can best be seen as “a paradigm of punishment – of what punishment ought to be” (p.183). More specifically, this article argues that probation should be conceptualized as a ‘constructive’ punishment which goes beyond the mere infliction of pain. In this context, probation would be “justified and administered as a punishment: as something that is imposed on or required of offenders, for the offences they have committed, and that is intended to be burdensome or painful…. but once we get clear about the nature and the significance of the burden or pain that such punishment should involve, we will be able to see that its purpose is not ‘merely punitive’ – and that we can deliberately impose such burdens or pains whilst still showing offenders the respect and concern due to them as our fellow citizens” (p.183)., Within this new conception, a sentencing hearing would “reflect the idea that crimes are public wrongs” (p.185) by - among other things - encouraging the offender to “face up not just to the harm he [or she] caused… but also and crucially to the wrong that he did; for the wrong and the harm are not identical” (p.185). “What should matter to both the victim and to the wider community, is thus not just such harm as [the offence] caused but the wrong that it involved….” (p.186). Making the offender aware of the wrong “is to censure or criticize him [or her] for it, as a wrong that [the offender] should not have committed” (p.186). In this context, it is argued that censure does, and should, cause pain. As such, the severity of the pain from the sentence should be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence. Under this scheme, the sentence must inevitably be “painful or burdensome” (p.189). However, while “punishment is…retributive in that it involves the imposition of something that is intended to be burdensome or painful” (p. 90), it should also be rehabilitative., Congruent with this approach, probation officers would play a crucial role in helping to negotiate a sentence “that would be appropriate to the nature and seriousness of the crime” (p.191). However, they would also be responsible for not only encouraging the offender to accept responsibility for the offence but also supervising him/her for the period of punishment., Conclusion. Clearly, this view of the sentencing process and the role of probation within the context of sentencing assumes a particular view of the purpose of sentencing – responding proportionally to the wrong that has been committed.  However, it may be a useful way of resolving what have traditionally been seen as conflicting roles for probation officers: the enforcement of the sentence and, at the same time, the provision of assistance or help to the offender.  This view suggests that these two duties are not in opposition to each other but rather inherently part of the proper function or role of probation., Reference: Duff, R.A.

"The decision to construct large prisons in small towns in rural America may have helped to buy political votes. However, this practice has not led to the creation of jobs for local residents nor have these correctional facilities contributed significantly to the local economy.",", Background.  In many parts of the U.S. and in at least one Canadian province (Ontario), large prisons have been located in rural areas. Not surprisingly, “local officials have often made generous offers in order to portray their site as an ideal choice” (p.1) for a correctional facility on the assumption that the local economy would profit from its establishment., This study examines the impact on the local economy of locating prisons in upstate New York. There is a clear logic in assuming that the establishment of a correctional facility in one’s community would be economically advantageous. Most obviously, it should provide additional jobs which, in turn, would put money into the economy. Given the needs of the prison itself, it should also shift purchases to the local rural economy. To test this hypothesis, seven upstate (largely rural) NY communities which had opened a correctional facility since 1982 were chosen. Seven other similar counties without new prisons were selected as a comparison group., The results suggest that few real economic benefits for the local community ensue from the establishment of a prison within the town. More specifically, it was found that:
there were no differences in unemployment rates between counties with and without prisons over a 25-year period (beginning before the prisons were opened and extending to 2001). While unemployment changed over time, the trends for counties that had built prisons and those that had not were remarkably similar. 
per capita income in rural counties with and without prisons went up between 1976 and 2000 but at almost identical rates., The findings from this study are consistent with other research demonstrating little effect of a new prison in the community on the local economy. Part of the reason for this is simple: the newly created jobs often go to those who do not live in the local area but rather commute to it. In addition, local residents may not qualify for correctional jobs (or may not be able to compete for these jobs because of union rules).  Further, they also may not qualify for jobs related to the construction of the new facility., In fact, this study found that correctional jobs in these rural communities are typically offered according to seniority, so that those already working within the correctional system get them. While moving may be necessary in order to take up these jobs, enough people were willing to do so to mean that local people would not be hired for years. Further, local businesses are typically not equipped to provide materials for the construction or the operation of prisons. To the extent that certain services have been contracted out in New York, they are typically given to the lowest bidder which has generally been larger companies already providing services to correctional facilities. Finally, prisons do not seem to provide “spin off” jobs in related industries. As one rural economist concluded, “prisons generate few linkages to the economy” (p.18)., Conclusion. “Reliance on a prison as a means of economic development is short sighted and [does not provide] any long-term growth” (p.19). Indeed, these institutions do not appear to produce the kinds of economic benefits that their supporters have suggested., Reference: King, Ryan S.; Marc Mauer and Tracy Huling (February 2003).

"The level of an individual’s punitiveness toward offenders depends on that which he/she perceives to be the causes of crime. Indeed, certain beliefs about the roots of criminal behaviour lead people to be more punitive.",", Background. It is obvious that those having certain political orientations tend to favour particular theories of crime. For instance, the conservative right perceives offenders as being “short on moral values and self-control” (p.2) and consequently views crime control as being best accomplished through swift, certain, and harsh punishment. On the other hand, the liberal left tends to “see crime as the result of forces external to the individual, such as inequality and discrimination” (p.2) and logically suggests other approaches for crime control., This study assesses individuals’ views of the causes of crime in a survey of Americans conducted in 1996. A number of different theoretical perspectives on both criminal behaviour and fear of crime were assessed. Punitiveness was measured by questions such as “It is important that the criminal justice system keep offenders locked up so that they can’t commit more crimes” and “It is important that the criminal justice system discourage others from committing crimes by showing that crime doesn’t pay” (p.9)., The results suggest that fear of crime and various demographic measures do not predict punitiveness above and beyond people’s theories of crime causation. Those views found to be related to punitiveness were as follows:
Classical theory – that crime is caused by inadequate punishments and citizens’ perceptions that they can ‘get away with’ crime. Not surprisingly, those who agreed with this perspective were found to be more punitive in nature.
Social process theories – that crime is the result of such factors as inadequate ties with non-criminal friends and family. Those holding these beliefs were also shown to be more punitive. 
Sub-cultural theory – that crime is rooted in membership of a group that tends to support or encourage crime. People subscribing to this view were more inclined to be punitive.
Structural positivism – that social/economic factors are responsible for crime. Those agreeing with this theory were found to be less punitive. 
Labelling theory – that contact with the criminal justice system increases people’s involvement in crime. Those people who held this belief tended to be less punitive., Interestingly, no relationship was found between punitiveness and two other theoretical explanations for crime: biological theories (e.g., offenders were born that way or are not intelligent) and psychological theories (e.g., offenders have emotional problems, or are emotionally damaged)., Conclusion. It would appear that the way in which a person views crime causation is important in understanding his/her level of punitiveness toward offenders. For example, those believing that criminal behaviour is affected by economic and social factors tend to be less punitive than are those who perceive crime as controlled by the severity of punishments handed down in a society. In this light, politicians (as well as others who speak publicly about crime policy) may affect the level of punitiveness in a society not only as a result of their statements about punishments but by the way in which they conceptualize the causes of crime., Reference: Sims, Barbara (2003).

"Finland, Holland, and Sweden are relatively similar economically and socially as well as in their crime trends. They have, however, demonstrated dramatically different patterns in prison populations over the past 50 years. The explanation for this divergence would appear to reside in their diverse political cultures.",", Background. In the last 50 years, the prison populations of Finland, Holland, and Sweden have shown considerably different trends. While the Finnish rate of prisoners per one hundred thousand residents has decreased steadily since 1950 (See Criminological Highlights, 3 (5), Item 1), the rate in Sweden has been fairly constant, and the rate in Holland went down for the first half of this period and up during the second half. At the same time, the rates of reported assaults, robberies and thefts went up dramatically in all three countries between 1950 and 2000., This study highlights the fact that imprisonment rates are largely the result of political decisions and cultural pressures rather than a direct outcome of crime rates or changes in economic development, unemployment or social marginalization. Indeed, these latter factors do not “appear to provide particularly good uniform explanations for the long-term decrease in Finland, the stability in Sweden, and the U-shaped trend witnessed in Holland” (p.22)., In Holland, the 1950s and early 60s seemed to be governed by a rehabilitative, anti-penal philosophy. Relatively stable levels of imprisonment continued from 1965 to 1975 -- a period characterized by constraints on prison capacity. However, pressure to expand the capacity of the prison system increased toward the end of the 1970s. By the early 1980s, law-and-order politics began to dominate Holland’s political scene as a result of concerns about rising crime and the legitimacy of the criminal justice system. After a period of economic crisis and concerns about immigration and drugs (including pressure from abroad to abandon its liberal drug policy), an explicit decision was made in 1985 in favour of the expansion of prison capacity., In Sweden, imprisonment was seen as “expensive, ineffective, and [a] detrimental form of punishment, the use of which should be limited to as great an extent as possible” (p.28). This overall philosophy controlled - at least to some extent - the prison population over the last half century. While a renewed focus on ‘security and sobriety’ (p.30) rather than rehabilitation has expanded the capacity of the prison system to some degree since the end of the 1990s, the inmate population appears to be stabilizing at a rate which is not substantially higher than that experienced generally over the previous 50 years., The Finnish decrease in prison population (from about 180 to 60 inmates per 100,000 residents) over the last half century is well known. Generally, admissions were restricted by virtually eliminating prison as a sanction for certain offences. In addition, shorter sentences were handed down for particular crimes. Further, not only has the “Finnish criminal policy … been exceptionally expert-oriented” (p.31), there has equally been a clear readiness on the part of the judiciary to accept this expert advice. Finally, Finland has also been successful in avoiding the influence of concerns surrounding drugs and immigrants., Conclusion. While we continue to lack good theories for explaining variation in the punitiveness of nations, it is clear that in the countries examined in this study, “the increase [in imprisonment] in Holland, the decrease in Finland, and the long stability in Sweden were made possible because no strong political opposition challenged the course of events.” Indeed, political culture may constitute a useful tool in beginning to unravel the significant differences between countries in their degree of punitiveness., Reference: Von Hofer, Hanns (2003).

"Are drug courts effective in reducing recidivism? Should we conclude that drug courts are a success? The answer appears to depend, to some extent, on the court that one studies and how carefully the data are examined.",", Background. It is probably fair to say that every drug court is different, and the fact that a given drug court is effective (or ineffective) depends on its particular characteristics. As such, we should not be surprised to see a range of outcomes of drug courts (See Criminological Highlights, 3(5) No. 2). Further, evaluations have been limited temporally as these special courts were only created approximately 15 years ago. Similarly, while it was estimated that there were roughly 800 such institutions in operation in the U.S. as of 2001, evaluations to-date have generally not been very rigorous in nature., This study of the Baltimore City Drug Treatment Court attempts to address several of the limitations surrounding current knowledge of the effectiveness of drug courts. In particular, this investigation used random assignment of offenders, largely agreed to by the judges due to limited space available in the drug court. Defendants from two different courts were randomly assigned to either the drug court or to a regular court. In the latter case, offenders received the post-adjudication treatment that was normally available. Conversely, the drug court “combined intensive supervision, drug testing, drug treatment, and judicial monitoring over the course of approximately two years” (p.176). In addition, defendants assigned to drug court were required to attend status hearings at the court every 2 weeks. Participants of this study were largely black (89%), in their 30s, and had multiple prior arrests (mean of 12) and convictions (mean of 5). Heroin and cocaine were the primary drugs involved., The results show that termination from the drug court program was fairly common (33% of the subjects were removed for non-compliance). Since these offenders tended to eventually be incarcerated, the proportion of subjects ultimately sent to prison as a result of the initial arrest (i.e. that which led to their participation in the drug court or control treatment) was roughly the same for the two groups. In addition, the total number of days incarcerated, on average, for subjects from these different courts did not differ significantly across the two conditions (drug court vs. normal treatment). Clearly, drug court did not save on incarceration. However, the drug court participants were obviously more likely than the offenders in the control group to receive certified drug treatment., Interestingly, if one looks at the proportion of each group re-arrested for any offence, it would appear that the drug court group performed better (66% were re-arrested within two years compared to 81% of the control group). However, the difference in re-arrests only existed for drug offences and not for any other type of crime. Further, the percent re-convicted (overall) did not differ (about 50% in each group). The study did not differentiate between in-program and post-program recidivism in large part because the 2-year follow-up was largely or completely in-program for some people in the drug court. As such, the difference in arrest rate may reflect variation in the exercise of discretion by the police vis-à-vis the drug court and control group offenders., Conclusion. The study is described as showing that the drug court is effective in “reducing criminal offending in a population of drug-addicted chronic offenders” (p.189). However, this conclusion is based on re-arrest figures (for drug offences largely) rather than re-conviction. Further, the authors make very clear that no difference existed in the mean number of days that the control and drug court offenders spent in prison. In this light, it would appear that effectiveness - like beauty - is in the eye of the beholder., Reference: Gottfredson, Denise C., Stacy S.

The imposition of harsher sentences does not deter crime.,"Background. Over the past 25 years, many reviews have been carried out of the research literature on deterrence. Those reviews which examined a substantial number of studies on the deterrent effect of sentence severity have concluded that no convincing evidence exists to suggest that harsher sentences deter. The reviews which have claimed that severe sanctions do reduce crime are based on a highly selected group of papers of questionable value (see below). Despite these findings, most scholars have been reluctant to claim definitively that variation in the severity of sentences (within ranges that are plausible in western democratic countries) does not have an impact on crime rates. Instead, the majority have suggested that more evidence is needed before a firm conclusion can be drawn., This paper concludes that “[i]t is time to accept the null hypothesis” that “variation in the severity of sanctions is unrelated to levels of crime” (p.143). Although the existence of the criminal justice system as a whole and the perception of an increased likelihood of apprehension appear to deter crime, no consistent and convincing evidence has emerged over the last quarter century to justify the claim that increases in sentence severity have a deterrent effect on criminal activity. In addition to those studies examined in earlier comprehensive reviews, this paper assesses the most recent research on the topic. Consistent with prior findings, this literature did not support the conclusion that harsh sentences deter. In particular, the following studies were reviewed:, Further, studies that purport to demonstrate deterrent impacts of harsh sentences are shown in this paper to have a range of serious problems. More specifically, the following problematic areas are identified:, Conclusion. The conclusion of this review paper is based on recent evidence including the inability of “3-strikes” sentencing regimes to reduce crime. Consistent with the findings of other comprehensive summaries, no convincing evidence was found to suggest that crime can be reduced by harsh sentences. It is true that one can never prove the absence of a phenomenon. However, the enormous efforts which have been expended over the past 30 years to find the opposite – that is, consistent deterrent effects (of harsher punishment) - have proven unsuccessful. From a policy perspective, it would seem that the time has come to accept the conclusion that harsh sentences do not deter., Reference: Doob, Anthony N. and Cheryl Marie Webster (2003).

"The imprisonment of women should be considered separately from that of men. Indeed, important differences exist between these two phenomena which require focused examination.",", Background. The increase in imprisonment rates of American men since the mid-1970s has been paralleled by similar trends in the imprisonment of women. Between 1925 and 1979, incarceration levels for women in the U.S. varied between 5 and 10 per hundred thousand. By 2000, this figure had risen to over 59 women per hundred thousand. The “war on drugs” is partly responsible for this dramatic increase. While “drugs” constituted the most serious offence for 12% of the women in state prisons in 1986, they accounted for 35% in 1999. Further, the growth of imprisonment of non-white women has increased at a faster rate in the last decade (1990-2000) than that of white women. This finding is remarkable - in part - because the levels of imprisonment of black, Hispanic, and American Indian women started off the decade considerably higher than those for white women. In other countries, the picture is different. In Canada, it would appear that we have not witnessed the dramatic changes in imprisonment rates of men and women which have occurred in the U.S. Further, the pattern in England and Wales is somewhat different from both those of the U.S. and Canada., This review of women’s imprisonment makes a number of points which highlight the importance of considering women’s imprisonment separately from that of men. For example:, Conclusion. Until fairly recently, the imprisonment of women has not received much attention from researchers in part because a substantially smaller number of women than men are incarcerated. However, with more than 91,000 women currently in prison in the U.S., low numbers can no longer justify this lack of knowledge. This review suggests that women’s experiences in prison and upon release are not only different from those of men, but also that there is considerable variation in the characteristics of women inmates, their prisons, and their experiences while incarcerated. Unfortunately, these aspects of the imprisonment of women are also inadequately understood., Reference: Kruttschnitt, Candace and Rosemary Gartner (2003). Women’s Imprisonment.

"Black adults on probation rate alternatives to imprisonment as being more punitive than do white probationers. Further, it appears that blacks - in comparison to whites – are more likely to prefer to avoid non-custodial options.",", Background.  It is easy to assume that non-custodial sanctions will generally be preferred over prison sentences. Indeed, the only obvious exception to this assumption would be at the extremes – e.g., the choice between a very short custodial sentence and a long term of probation with many onerous conditions. However, an offender’s preference for alternative sanctions may not be as straightforward as one would think. Non-custodial sentences also involve a certain degree of risk to the offender. For instance, a term of probation may include conditions with which it is difficult to comply (e.g., non-association orders, curfews, abstaining from alcohol). Consequently, these sentences put people at risk of being charged with additional ‘administration of justice’ offences. Particularly for those who do not have confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system – such as blacks in the U.S. and in Canada (See Criminological Highlights, 3(1), Item 3) – non-custodial sanctions may not be an attractive alternative. Indeed, they may be seen as little more than indirect tickets to prison if these populations suspect that they will not be fairly treated by those who are supervising them., This study interviewed black and white probationers in Indiana. Approximately 75% of them had spent some time in a county jail, and many had experienced various alternative sanctions.  Respondents were asked to indicate the number of months of each of 10 alternative sanctions that they would be willing to endure to avoid imprisonment of 4, 8, and 12 months. In many instances, respondents indicated that - if given a choice - they would refuse to participate in the specified alternative. For them, straight time in prison was considered preferable to the non-custodial sentence. More blacks than whites indicated that they would choose the prison sentence over any length of the alternative sanction for each of 10 alternatives when contrasted with each of three different lengths of imprisonment (30 comparisons in all). In fact, when given a choice between prison and alternatives such as day reporting, regular probation, or electronic monitoring, blacks were two to six times more likely than whites to choose the custodial sentence. For those willing to choose a non-prison sanction over imprisonment, blacks were more likely than whites to indicate that the alternative had to be very short for it to be an attractive substitute for custody. For example, blacks (on average) said that approximately three months of electronic monitoring would make an enticing alternative to four months of imprisonment, whereas whites stated that they would be willing to endure up to 6.3 months of this non-custodial sanction to avoid the same four-month prison sentence., Conclusion. Given the over-representation of certain disadvantaged groups in prisons (e.g., blacks in the U.S. and Canada; aboriginal people in Canada), it is often suggested that additional effort should be expended to find alternative sanctions for these offenders. For example, section 718.2(e) of the Canadian Criminal Code requires judges to consider “all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances … for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.” This study suggests that alternatives to imprisonment may not be seen as equally desirable by all groups in society. If, in fact, one is attempting to impose the least onerous sentence, the most appropriate sanction may be in the eyes of the beholder., Reference: Wood, Peter B. and David C. May (2003).

"“Scared Straight” programs in which young people ‘visit’ prisons in order to ‘teach them’ that crime does not pay were initially shown to be ineffective in the early 1980s. Despite the same conclusion having been reached more recently by nine high quality evaluations, they continue to be used. Even more disturbing is the fact that such programs have been shown to increase offending.",", Background. Crime fighters are constantly looking for “quick, short-term, and inexpensive cures to solve difficult social problems” (p.43) such as crime. This phenomenon has been identified by one researcher as the “Panacea Phenomenon” (p.43). “Scared Straight” and other “juvenile awareness” programs remain attractive to those looking for quick fixes. In these programs, young people are taken for visits of prisons and are “educated” by inmates about the consequences of offending.  Like boot camps, the theory is that “tough” treatments work. The idea appears to be that the youth learns that penitentiaries are unpleasant places and, by extension, that crime does not pay. Though the operational costs of these programs are minimal, the initial (1982) evaluation of the first “Scared Straight” initiative showed that they were ineffective, at best, and a cause of increased crime, at worst. Nevertheless, as recently as 1999, a program extolling the virtues of the original project was aired on television in various locations. Indeed, despite evidence to the contrary, “Scared Straight-type programs remain popular and continue to be used” (p.44)., This paper examines the nine highest quality evaluations of these programs. Carried out in eight different states, these studies involved approximately 1000 juveniles who were randomly assigned to either a Scared Straight-type program or a control group. Various official measures such as arrests, juvenile court intakes or charge measures, were used to assess group outcomes. The findings are similar to those published 20 years ago: “The nine [studies taken as a whole] do not yield evidence for a positive effect for Scared Straight and other juvenile awareness programs on subsequent delinquency” (p.52)., The more disturbing findings from this set of research replicate those demonstrated by the initial evaluation. When one looks across all of the studies, most of the comparisons between the experimental and control groups on measures of subsequent offending - though not always individually statistically significant - showed that the Scared Straight youths committed more crime. In fact, only one of the nine studies demonstrated positive impacts of the program. Overall, then, “[t]he intervention increases the odds of offending by about 1.7:1 (i.e. 1.7 treatment participants offend for every control youth who offends)” (p.55). Clearly, “[d]oing nothing would have been better than exposing juveniles to the program” (p.58)., Conclusion. This program appears to increase rather than decrease crime. Nevertheless, “despite the gloomy findings reported here and elsewhere, Scared Straight and its derivatives continue in use…. When the negative results from [a California program] came out, the result was to end evaluation – not the program. Today the… program continues, evaluated by the testimonials of prisoners and participants alike” (p.59). While it is not understood why the program has a criminogenic effect, it is clear that initiatives such as this one need to be evaluated and monitored to ensure that crime is not made even worse. Indeed, negative impacts of well-intentioned interventions have occurred before (see Criminological Highlights, 5(4) Item 1). The research on Scared Straight highlights the importance of relying on hard data rather than anecdotal evidence when assessing the crime reduction strategies., Reference: Petrosino, Anthony; Carolyn Turpin-Petrosino and John Buehler (September 2003).

A large scale multi-site (U.S.) study finds that many youths (aged 15 and younger) demonstrate levels of impairment in responding to the criminal justice system consistent with the performance of those typically found incompetent to stand trial.,", Background.  It is well established that youths in their mid-teens have less knowledge about legal concepts and trials than do young adults. At the same time, adolescents are perceived to be as capable as adults in understanding factual and conceptual information that is provided to them. The problem resides in the fact that young people appear to be less competent than the adult population in making decisions that relate to their legal situation. More specifically, “[d]ifferences between adolescents and adults not only are cognitive, but also involve aspects of psychosocial maturation that include progress toward greater future orientation, better risk perception, and less susceptibility to peer influence” (p.335)., The basic question addressed in this study is whether younger adolescents should be considered to be fully competent as defendants in criminal proceedings. Building on previous studies (See, for example, Criminological Highlights 1(6)Item 1, 4(4)Item 4; 5(3)Item 5), young people’s abilities were assessed in four U.S. cities using samples of youths (aged 11-17) and young adults (aged 18-24) drawn from the community as well as correctional institutions. These two populations were evaluated using both a standardized measure of “competence to stand trial” and a measure of the quality of their decisions regarding the adjudicative process. Various other factors (e.g., intelligence, the presence of mental health problems) were also examined., The results showed consistent age effects which were generally found across the community and custodial samples. In terms of legal competence, younger youths tended to understand the process to a lesser degree and were less capable of recognizing and processing both the information that was relevant for a legal defence and its applicability for the youth’s own situation. Generally speaking, the 11-13 year olds and the 14-15 year olds performed less well than did the older youths (aged 16-17) and young adults. Not surprisingly, more intelligent youths (at each age) performed better. However, even among those in the youngest age group (11-13) with average or higher IQs, approximately 20% were “seriously impaired with respect to understanding or reasoning or both” (p.350). Further, over 50% of those aged 11-13 years in the lowest IQ group (who were over-represented in the custodial sample) were found to be significantly impaired. One of the forms in which this impairment manifested itself within this youngest age category was the significantly greater tendency to comply with authority (e.g., police) these youths showed compared to the older groups. This age effect held across gender, ethnicity, and the respondent’s current residence (i.e. community or custody)., Conclusion. The data show that “juveniles aged 15 and younger are significantly more likely than older adolescents and young adults to be impaired in ways that compromise their ability to serve as competent defendants in a criminal proceeding …. Approximately one third of 11-13 year olds and one fifth of 14-15 year olds are as impaired in capacities relevant to adjudicative competence as are seriously mentally ill adults who would likely be considered incompetent to stand trial by clinicians who perform evaluations for courts” (p. 356). These age-related effects held across demographic groups in the community and in a sample of people who were in custody.  Once again, it is clear that it is important to respect these differences when developing procedures for dealing with young offenders., Reference: Grisso, Thomas; Lawrence Steinberg; Jennifer Woolard; Elizabeth Cauffman; Elizabeth Scott; Sandra Graham; Fran Lexcen; N.

"Beware of the soundbite question. The picture that one gets of the public’s views of mandatory sentencing laws depends on the questions which are asked. Simple, general questions tend to portray the public as harsh and vengeful. In contrast, specific questions about particular cases demonstrate a more thoughtful and nuanced set of public attitudes.",", Background. Most western nations have at least some mandatory sentencing laws. This legislation has typically been created for political reasons rather than as a result of a careful assessment of justice needs. Indeed, given that public opinion polls in many countries indicate that people perceive sentences to be too lenient (p.486), it could be argued that mandatory sentencing laws – which invariably seem to be harsh in nature – are consistent with public wishes. Further, this type of legislation promises certainty and severity - two sentencing principles apparently favoured by the public., This paper examines the public’s views of mandatory sentencing laws. It begins by noting that people in many countries - including Canada – are not able to identify those offences which carry mandatory minimum sentences. Further, opinion polls do not typically ask people to consider the actual or opportunity costs of these sanctions or the fact that many mandatory laws violate the principle of proportionality in sentencing. In addition, survey respondents are rarely given a choice between mandatory sentences and the obvious alternative (i.e. allowing judges to determine sanctions)., These initial observations are particularly relevant in light of the fact that some of the support for this type of legislation may come from those who do not consider the implications of mandatory sentences or their alternatives. In one study, it was clear that part of the popular support for 3-strikes sentencing laws is derived from people who only think about this legislation in broad, abstract terms. For instance, 88% of respondents supported the notion of harshly punishing third-time felony offenders. In contrast, only 17% of these same people indicated support for concrete sentences presented to them that would be imposed as a result of 3-strikes laws. Clearly, it would appear that people may not be thinking of actual cases when indicating support for harsh mandatory sentences. As an illustrative example, most people polled in Canada favour the mandatory life sentence for murder. However, approximately three quarters of Canadians also indicated being opposed to this legislation in the Robert Latimer case (i.e. an individual charged with killing his severely disabled daughter who was experiencing chronic severe pain). In other words, “[t]he mandatory sentence appeals to the public in principle, but once confronted with actual cases, people quickly [abandon] their position and express a preference for less punitive punishment” (p.501). This phenomenon may be explained – in part – by the fact that consideration of mandatory sentences for individual cases calls attention to violations of proportionality – a principle that the public has been shown to strongly support., Conclusion. Though “it would be overstating the case to conclude that the public strongly opposes mandatory sentences” (p.505), it would appear that the public responds quite differently to individual cases in which a mandatory sentence might be imposed and to the concept more generally. Given that most members of the public do not immediately consider the full consequences of a mandatory sentencing regime, this apparent inconsistency is not surprising. One might suggest that a legislature which is considering mandatory sentences should go beyond the slogan of being “tough on crime” and take into account both the broader implications of mandatory sentences and the public’s response to those cases falling under such a regime., Reference: Roberts, Julian V. (2003). Public Opinion and Mandatory Sentencing.

"Women who live in economically disadvantaged neighbourhoods are more likely than other women to experience violence at the hands of their intimate partners. This finding appears to be a true neighbourhood effect – that is, it holds true even when relevant characteristics of the couple are statistically held constant.",", Background.  “There is evidence that intimate violence against women is associated with economic disadvantage at both the neighbourhood and individual levels” (pp. 207-8). The challenge is clearly to determine whether the effects that appear at the neighbourhood level are due to characteristics of the victim and offender or, alternatively, to those of the neighbourhoods in which they live. While traditionally less studied in the criminological literature, the latter explanation is not without theoretical support. According to social disorganization theory, “residents of structurally disadvantaged areas are more likely to have weak social bonds to their neighbours than [are] residents of advantaged neighbourhoods” (p.209). As such, this lack of social cohesion may lead to increased risk for domestic violence because potential victims are isolated and their neighbours are less likely to intervene or call the police., This study examines data from a U.S. longitudinal survey and focuses on 5031 couples identified in 1994 as having lived together since they were initially interviewed in 1988.  If at least one of the two partners indicated that violence had been used against the woman in the previous year, the case was described as being one in which wife assault had taken place. Using 1990 census data, respondents were divided into four equal groups according to the level of disadvantage of their neighbourhood in 1994. In neighbourhoods falling into the three most advantaged groups, the rates of violence against the female partner were remarkably similar (roughly 3.5%). In contrast, the rate of violence in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods was almost twice as high (6.9%). In other words, “[i]t is only in the upper end of the distribution [of economic disadvantage] that the crime-related effects of disadvantage [on wife assault] are manifested” (p.218)., The results focus on the level of wife assault in 1994 holding constant not only the level of intimate violence that she experienced in 1988 but also various other characteristics of the couple (e.g., several income measures, whether the male was reported to have a drinking problem, instability of employment of the male, age, race, and education). Not surprisingly, women who had experienced violence in 1988 were more likely to have been assaulted six years later. Male employment instability was also associated with high levels of intimate violence against the female partner in 1994 (consistent with findings reported in Criminological Highlights, 3(2), Item 6)., Most interesting were the neighbourhood effects.  It is often difficult to disentangle neighbourhood effects from individual effects because it may be the case that the couple’s own disadvantaged socioeconomic status puts them at risk for both living in a disadvantaged community and increased domestic violence.  However, this study demonstrated that when the couple’s own socioeconomic status was controlled for, the average socioeconomic status of the neighbourhood affected the likelihood of domestic violence.  Indeed, those women living in neighbourhoods with either the highest level of concentrated disadvantage or high concentrations of people who had moved during the previous five years (a measure of neighbourhood instability) were most likely to have experienced violence at the hands of their partners., Conclusion.  The likelihood of being the victim of wife assault is a function not only of the characteristics of the couple, but also of the neighbourhoods in which they reside. It would appear that the risk to any woman of being the victim of wife assault increases if the couple lives in a neighbourhood whose level of social and economic disadvantage is severe., Reference: Benson, Michael L; G.

"Canadian police departments indicate that they prefer to take a “minimalist role” in situations involving labour unrest. Their policies state that order is to be maintained by “limiting the show and use of force, while relying on negotiation and persuasion to resolve conflicts” (p.220).",", Background.  In recent decades, there has been increasing evidence of a shift in police strategy when dealing with labour strikes. More specifically, the prevention of violence is currently sought through “communication, negotiation, self-policing, and restraint in the use of arrest powers” (p.220)., This study examined the policies for dealing with labour disputes as described by officers in 38 large police forces in major population centres in Canada. Twenty-one of these police forces had written policies explicitly pertaining to the policing of labour disputes. An additional 12 had more general strategies which dealt with labour strike situations within a more general policy. Findings showed that “[m]ost [police] services reported … a major shift to “liaison approach policing” in the early to mid-1990s” (p.223). These strategies reflected the views by police “that unions could be relied on to control their members under most circumstances and that close policing was not only unnecessary, but frequently harmful” (p.224). Organizationally, police intervention typically took the form of specific personnel with “a high level of expertise in communication skills and conflict resolution” (p.224) who would be assigned a specialized ‘labour liaison’ function. The role of these officers was generally proactive, in that they would make contact with both sides before strikes had even begun. One purpose of this early contact was to aid the parties in developing protocols on such matters as the amount of time that vehicles and people could be delayed at the picket line. Overall, police policy mandated that officers’ public roles should be limited to those situations involving true safety concerns or criminal acts. Otherwise, the policies indicated that police officers should minimize their presence but offer advice on avoiding disputes where necessary. Apparently, employers who were interested in engaging the police to stop union members from blocking people or vehicles are typically told to seek civil remedies rather than using the criminal process., Unions indicated to the researchers that they “often modified their picket behaviour where they thought the police requests were reasonable … such adjustments [being] interpreted as ‘negotiated outcomes’ not as products of police or legal coercion” (p.227). As alternatives to the “display of uniformed personnel, arrests and force, this view ‘talks up’ or reproduces the centrality of civil courts and labour boards” (p.228). An advantage to the police of using civil rather than criminal remedies is that officers are able to maintain a relationship of trust with both sides rather than using force against one faction in the service of the other. One reason that such a “mediation” or “managerial” role may work is that labour disputes - unlike many conflictual public order situations - involve parties that not only have had similar prior experiences and are known to each other and to the police, but they can also expect to face similar situations in the future., Conclusion. The development of policies for dealing with labour disputes suggests that “Canadian police are defining and applying their role in a substantially different manner” (p.230) from that which was the norm in the past. More specifically, they currently see their primary function as avoiding conflict and “realizing their own interests by bringing their practices in line with a labour relations regime of consent-based controls” (p.232)., Reference: Hall, Alan and Willem de Lint (2003).

"Private prisons in the U.S. appear to be having significantly more than their share of staff turnover, escapes and drug use.","Background. About one in twenty state and federal prisoners in the U.S. are housed in private prisons. The U.S. federal government and several states (as well as some provinces in Canada) seem to favour private prisons because they apparently save money in the short term. The question, of course, is not just whether this type of correctional facility is cheaper, but whether it also meets or surpasses the standards of publicly run institutions., This study reports the results of a survey of government officials responsible for monitoring private prisons. It focuses on three issues: staff, escapes, and drug use by inmates. This research emphasizes staffing issues largely because two other areas of the survey – training and custody standards –showed no differences with publicly operated prisons. This result reflects, to a great extent, the fact that contractors adopted the same standards as those followed by the jurisdictions with which they were contracting. 81% of the privately housed inmates covered by the survey are held in prisons operated by two companies: the Corrections Corporation of America and Wackenhut Corrections Corporation. As such, the comparisons drawn in this study are largely between these private prisons and those run by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). Unlike the private sector facilities, the BOP houses many inmates in minimum security prisons without a secure perimeter. As a result, these correctional institutions were excluded from the analysis as no equivalent group exists in the private sector. Unfortunately, some bias in favour of private prisons was introduced because this sector often houses these same minimum security inmates in secure facilities. In addition, it “is further advantaged in the comparisons because the private sector held much lower numbers of high- or maximum-security inmates than did the BOP” (p.434)., The findings demonstrate that “although the overall staff-to-inmate ratios are about the same for private prisons and the BOP, private companies emphasized custody staff” (p.437). Consequently, one might expect that whatever other differences may exist between the two systems, private prisons would be good at accomplishing “custody.” However, private prison companies in the U.S. are not very successful at retaining their staff. Using a “separation rate” to measure staff turnover (i.e. an index of the number of staff who left their jobs voluntarily or non-voluntarily during a six-month period over the number of people on staff), BOP prisons lost only  4.4% of their staff.  In contrast, 64 of 67 privately run prisons had rates of 10% or higher. Indeed, 22 of the 67 private prisons had turnover rates of over 50% on this measure (p.439). These differences are as true for new private prisons as older ones., Further, staff are not the only ones who appear eager to escape from private prisons. Only one of 68 BOP prisons experienced an escape (of one person) during 1999. In contrast, 12 of 68 private prisons experienced a total of 23 escapes (p.442). Homicide rates were comparable in the two sets of prisons. Drug use - measured by random urinanalysis tests – appeared to be higher in private prisons with 66% of the private  prisons having at least one prisoner who tested positive for use of drugs compared to publicly run prisons where only 38% had one or more inmates who tested positive for drug use during the same period (p.440).  11 of 68 (16%) publicly operated prisons had inmate “drug use” rates of 3% or more.  In contrast, a much higher proportion (41%) of the privately run prisons had inmate drug use rates of this level or higher., Conclusion: “Privately operated prisons appear to have systemic problems in maintaining secure facilities” (p.444). The evidence shows that the private prison industry is not successful at retaining employees. As a consequence, inexperienced staff may be responsible for (some of) the problems which seem to exist in operating these institutions. If governments turned to private prisons as a cost-savings measure, it may be that they are getting what they paid for., Reference: Camp, Scott D. and Gerald G. Gaes (2002).

Can 3-strikes laws promote crime?  Evidence has shown that this legislation does not reduce criminal activity through incapacitation or deterrence.  This study suggests that these laws can actually promote killings.,", Background.  Since three strikes laws became a criminal justice fad in the early 1990s, the evidence has convincingly demonstrated that they do not reduce crime. Further, they can be a significant drain on public resources as large numbers of minor offenders are incarcerated (in some states) for long periods of time., This study, starting from a “rational decision making” perspective, examined the possibility that offenders in 3-strikes states will attempt to avoid apprehension for serious offences by acting in a rational way. More specifically, it is argued that because the penalty for an offence like robbery is, in effect, the same as the penalty for homicide for many serious offenders, the “rational” criminal may attempt to avoid apprehension by killing victims, potential witnesses, or police officers., Using data from 188 American cities - only some of which had three strikes laws - this study examined the potential homicide promoting effects of this legislation in the period before, during, and after these laws came into effect. Other variables known to relate to homicide rates (e.g., percent African-American, percent young, percent female headed households, percent living below the poverty line, etc.) as well as changes in other measures of violence in these cities were controlled for statistically., The results were clear: “Homicide rates have grown faster (or declined at a slower rate) in three strikes cities compared with cities without the laws” (p.408). “Passage of a three-strikes law has increased homicides, on average, by 13% to 14% over the short term, and 16% to 24% over the long term” (p.409). Finally, “there is no evidence that increases in homicide rates promote state legislatures to enact three strikes laws” (p.412)., Conclusion: “Although policy makers anticipated that [3-stikes] laws would “fix the problem” of serious crime by deterring active criminals and incapacitating repeat offenders… the climate of fear and hysteria in which the statutes were passed actually increased the likelihood of failure or negative unintended consequences” (p.418). It is clear that “policy makers should take more care to weigh, not just the potential benefits of a proposed crime control solution, but the costs as well” (p.419). “Two studies have now found that three-strikes laws increase homicide rates” (p.419). However, what is not known with any certainty is whether this effect occurs because of the hypothesized mechanism of sophisticated offenders killing innocent people in attempts to avoid detection and prosecution. Indeed, several other plausible explanations (e.g., homicide as a defiant reaction against more severe sanctioning practices) would have to be ruled out before a ‘rational model’ explanation can be accepted., Reference: Kovandzic, Tomislav V., John J. Sloan III, and Lynne M. Vieraitis (2002). Unintended Consequences of Politically Popular Sentencing Policy: The Homicide Promoting Effects of “Three Strikes” in U.S. Cities (1980-1999).

"The U.S. War on Drugs and other imprisonment programs appear to ensure a continued supply of criminals. Indeed, there is “compelling evidence that offenders who are sentenced to prison have higher rates of recidivism… than do offenders placed on probation” (p. 329).",", Background. “Scholarly research generally concludes that increasing the severity of penalties will have little, if any, effect on crime” (p.330). Similarly, the increase of sanctions for drug use and distribution has little (if any) effect on drug consumption. However, like many of the sentencing changes that have taken place since 1990, the War on Drugs in the U.S. is based on a deterrence model. Though much of the focus on sentencing reform has been on general deterrence, there is also a literature suggesting that imprisonment has no measurable impact on the likelihood of a punished offender committing a subsequent offence. Custodial and non-custodial sentences appear to be equally effective (or ineffective) in their effects on recidivism., This study looked at 342 drug offenders and 735 non-drug offenders (some of whom had a history of involvement with drugs) convicted in 1993. Approximately two thirds had been sentenced to probation while the others had gone to prison. Controlling for factors known to be related to recidivism (e.g., gender, race, employment, age, prior convictions as well as factors related to the likelihood of imprisonment in 1993), the study looked at recidivism over a four-year period. Various measures of recidivism (i.e. a new charge being filed, subsequent incarceration, “time to failure”) were examined., The results showed that “offenders who were sentenced to prison were significantly more likely than offenders placed on probation [in 1993] to be arrested and charged with a new offence…, to be… sentenced to jail or prison for a new offence” (p.342) and to “fail” more quickly. These results held for drug offenders, those involved with drugs but not convicted of a drug offence, and those without drug involvement. In all cases, those sentenced to prison in 1993 were more likely to recidivate than those sentenced to probation., Conclusion: The authors conclude that “[t]he results… provide no support for the deterrent effect of imprisonment.  Despite the fact that we used several different measures of recidivism, tested for the effect of imprisonment on different types of offenders, included a control for the offender’s predicted probability of incarceration for the 1993 offence, and examined recidivism rates during a relatively long follow-up period [48 months], we found no evidence that imprisonment reduced the likelihood of recidivism.  Instead, we found compelling evidence that offenders who were sentenced to prison had higher rates of recidivism and recidivated more quickly than offenders placed on probation” (p.350).  “The findings of this study cast doubt on the assumptions underlying the crime control policies implemented during the past two decades… Policies pursued during the War on Drugs have been counterproductive” (p.352). That is, unless one is in a profession that profits from high crime rates or has investments in the prison industry., Reference: Spohn, Cassia and David Holleran (2002).

"It is people, not crime rates, who account for white residents’ perceptions of crime. Studies in three American cities show that one’s perception of the level of crime is associated with the proportion of young black men in a neighbourhood, even after controlling for the amount of actual criminal activity.",", Background.  Fear of crime is an important determinant of people’s everyday lives as well as their views about the ways in which those who offend should be handled by the criminal justice system. This recognition may be important in shedding light on the tendency of whites to avoid living in neighbourhoods with high proportions of black residents. Indeed, this behaviour raises the question of whether part of this avoidance is due to the perception that black Americans are associated with crime., This study examines the relationship between the racial composition of a neighbourhood and the perceptions of white residents of neighbourhood crime levels. Unlike neighbourhood crime rates, “[a] neighbourhood’s racial composition is a readily observable characteristic” (p.721). Furthermore, evidence suggests that “[t]he stereotype of blacks as criminals is widely known and is deeply embedded in the collective consciousness of Americans, irrespective of the level of prejudice or personal beliefs” (p.722). Data from surveys in three cities – Chicago, Seattle, and Baltimore – were examined in an attempt to understand the way(s) in which people infer their neighbourhood’s crime rate. The actual level of crime in the neighbourhood was controlled for by examining official statistics and, in two cities, victimization measures from the survey. The effects of other factors (e.g., income, the physical deterioration of the neighbourhood) were also removed. The study hypothesized that the proportion of young black men in the neighbourhood would be used by residents as an indicator of the crime rate. More specifically, high numbers of young black men would be interpreted as indicating a high level of crime., The results in all three cities supported this hypothesis. In Chicago, for example, both the proportion of young black men and the crime rate as well as indicators of general disorder or incivilities (e.g., noise problems and insults among persons on the street) were predictors of the perception that crime was a problem (p.740). The results for Seattle were similar. Over and above crime rates and victimization experience, the percent of young black men predicted respondents’ perception of neighbourhood crime rates. In addition, individuals who reported numerous teenagers hanging out in the street were also more likely to report that their neighbourhood had a serious crime problem (p.742). Further, the Baltimore data showed that above and beyond crime rates, the percent of black residents as well as personal victimization had an impact on perceived levels of crime. There was some evidence in Seattle and Baltimore that these effects were stronger for white residents than for black residents (p.744)., Conclusion. It would appear that “whites are averse to black neighbours in part because certain neighbourhood problems, namely crime, are perceived to be worse in black neighbourhoods” (p.748). However, the results “contradict the assumption that this perception simply reflects actual differences in neighbourhood crime levels” (p.748). Thus, it seems that whites “systematically overestimate the extent to which perceptible black and neighbourhood crime rates are associated” (p.749). Indeed, it would seem that perceptions of crime levels are still very ‘black and white’., Reference: Quillian, Lincoln and Devah Pager (2001). Black Neighbors, Higher Crime?

What accounts for the variation in imprisonment rates across time and place? One thing is clear: it isn’t crime rates.,", Background. It is well known that imprisonment rates vary dramatically across western countries.  The U.S. leads the pack (with a 1997-8 rate of 645 per 100,000 people, followed by New Zealand and Portugal (with 145) and England & Wales and Canada (with 125 and 115 respectively). At the opposite end of the continuum, one finds Denmark, Sweden, Greece, Finland and Norway (with 55-65). In addition, “[s]tunning dissimilarity in imprisonment trends between countries becomes apparent when longitudinal data are examined” (p.8). Yet, the criminal justice institutions “are much the same” (p.3)., Looking, for example, at the U.S., Finland and Germany, we find that in all three countries violent crime and, to some extent, homicide rates increased fairly consistently from the 1960s to the 1990s.  However, the imprisonment trends are very different.  Imprisonment in the U.S. began to rise dramatically in the mid-1970s (approximately 15 years after violent crime started increasing) and continued to swell through the 1990s. In Finland (see Criminological Highlights, Volume 3, Number 5, Item 1), as in Austria (p.270), imprisonment rates decreased dramatically throughout the same period. In Germany, imprisonment varied somewhat, but decreased during this time. Self-report victimization rates across western countries also do not show any obvious relationship with imprisonment rates., One obvious difference between European countries, on the one hand, and the U.S. (and perhaps Canada) on the other, is that in Europe “crime rates and patterns [of crime] are not regarded as something easily controlled or necessarily much affected by punishment policies” (p.4). Another distinction between U.S. and other countries’ approaches to punishment is that the former tends to have rigid provisions ensuring that legislated punitivism is carried out in full. “Populist punitivism” in the U.S. - in contrast with other nations - is allowed to run unchecked (p.18). Further differences are rooted in the existence of U.S. guidelines (sometimes, as in the U.S. federal system, more mandatory than ‘guiding’) which were created, in some instances, to ensure high levels of imprisonment. Finally, diverse responses to prison overcrowding have contributed to variation in imprisonment rates. More specifically, the U.S. simply built or contracted for more prison space as a solution. In contrast, several European countries (e.g., Denmark, Norway, and the Netherlands) established “waiting lists” for prison spaces such that offenders sentenced to prison would serve their time only when a space became available., It would seem that European countries have been less willing than the U.S. to commit huge amounts of public funds to the punishment of offenders. Further, most countries that have become more punitive in their responses to violent offenders have tended to “reconcile populist punitive pressures with budgetary and prison-capacity limitations” (p.263) by attempting to reduce the use of expensive prison sentences for less serious offences. Despite an apparent increase in sanctions directed at those who commit “quality of life” offences (p.263), there seems to be less enthusiasm recently for straight punishment in cases in which other approaches are available (e.g., the development of drug courts)., Conclusion. It should be remembered that until the 1960s, U.S. crime policy was not dominated by short-term political interests as it is now. In contrast, “Criminal justice issues in most European countries are still relatively non-politicized and unaffected by media-driven sensationalism: Judges and prosecutors are largely career civil servants… and criminal justice policy is dominated by professional, academic, and bureaucratic elites” (p.276). The difference between these policy processes may be important., Reference: Tonry, Michael and Richard S. Frase (eds.) (2001). Sentencing and Sanctions in Western Countries. Oxford University Press.

"The presence of a firearm in a criminal incident appears to have a complex relationship with the outcome.  Firearms have different impacts on the likelihood that a conflict will lead to an attack, the likelihood of injury, and the likelihood that, if injured, the injury will be a serious one. However, their effects do not seem to be dependent on the offender’s intent.",", Background.  Separating the effects of firearms from those of the offender’s intent on the outcome of a conflict is difficult. Two competing theories exist: 1) firearms are more likely to be used if the offender has an intent to harm and 2) the presence of a firearm has an impact on the amount of harm done, independent of intent., This study analyzes “more than 2000 violent and potentially violent events described by [newly incarcerated male] offenders in order to assess the role of weapons and offender intentions in the outcomes of these events” (p.271). Respondents were asked about events involving assaults, as well as incidents in which “there was a high risk of violence but actual violence by or against the respondent was avoided” (p.277). The study examines the impact of a firearm or other weapon on the likelihood of an attack, the likelihood of an injury (if an attack took place) and the likelihood that the injury (if one existed) was severe. In addition, the researchers also recorded whether or not the respondent intended to do serious harm., The results show that the impact of the presence of a firearm or other weapon depends, to some extent, on the stage of the conflict that one is examining. Given a situation which is potentially violent, the likelihood that an attack will take place appears to be associated with the possession of a firearm or another weapon. Not surprisingly, those offenders who, at the beginning of the incident, had the intent to commit physical harm were also more likely to do so. However, the effect of the possession of a firearm or other weapon was independent of intent. Incidents in which the offender intended harm and those in which he did not were each associated with higher likelihood of attack when a weapon was available. Not unexpectedly, the likelihood of an attack was reduced if the opponent had a firearm (p.283). When one looks at the likelihood that an attack will result in injury, it appears that incidents involving attacks with firearms were less likely to involve injury than incidents without weapons. In contrast, incidents involving other weapons were more likely to result in injury. Although incidents involving the intent to injure were more likely to involve injury, the effect of intent was once again independent of the effects of firearms or other weapons. Essentially what appears to be happening with firearms incidents is that the attack is often unsuccessful: the offender misses the target. An attack with another weapon or an attack without a weapon is more likely to be successful (pp. 284-285). Finally, if an injury does effectively occur, it is more likely to be serious if it involves a firearm, though other weapons also increase the likelihood of serious injury. However, these effects are again the same for those offenders who did and did not intend to harm their opponent (p.286)., Conclusion. Perhaps one of the most important findings of this study is that the hypothesis that “weapons effects would depend on an assailant’s intent to seriously injure his opponent was not supported by the data” (p.290). Firearms have somewhat different impacts at each stage of conflicts and do not depend on offenders’ intent.  Thus, attacks with firearms appear to be associated with fewer injuries than attacks without firearms, but where an injury takes place, the injury is more likely to be serious.  However, there is no evidence that highly motivated offenders will exert extra effort to compensate for less effective or no weaponry., Reference: Wells, William and Julie Horney (2002).

Court-mandated counseling for domestic violence offenders does not appear to reduce domestic violence.,", Background.  Victims of wife assault often return to their assaultive spouses even after they have been found guilty of the offence. Consequently, courts are often eager to reduce the likelihood of subsequent victimization. One way in which they do this is to order men to submit to a “spouse abuse abatement program” (p.344). “The most popular of these programs is a feminist cognitive psychoeducational approach, called the Domestic Abuse Intervention Program. Referred to simply as the Duluth Model, it focuses on battering as part of a range of male behaviours used to control women. The curriculum is taught in group sessions that emphasize the modification and development of cognitive techniques that batterers can use to avoid conflict” (p.344). The evaluation of these programs is important since it appears that “the most influential predictor of an abused spouse’s return to her husband is his participation in counseling” (p.345). In other words, it would seem that women return to abusive spouses in part because they think that he has been or will be “cured” by treatment., This study took all men who were convicted of “misdemeanor domestic violence” during a five-month period in one county in Florida and placed them on probation. In addition, half of these individuals were randomly assigned to attend 26 weeks of group sessions from a local batterers’ intervention group as part of their sentence. Most men who were required by the court to participate in the assigned sessions did, in fact, attend most of them. In contrast, few of those who were simply placed on probation attended a treatment program., The results are easy to describe. The treatment program had no impact on offenders’ attitudes toward women, wife beating, the seriousness of domestic assault, or the offender’s estimate of the likelihood of repeat violence. Since the groups were created by random assignment, it can be assumed that they were equivalent on all dimensions at the outset of the experiment. At the end of the treatment, the two groups did not differ on measures of abuse from both the victim’s and the offender’s self-reports (p.365). Official arrest statistics tell the same story: “24% of the men in both the experimental and control group were rearrested on one or more occasions during their one-year probation” (p.366)., Conclusion. There seem to be no “clear and demonstrable positive effects of this court mandated… program on offenders’ attitudes, beliefs, and behaviours” (p.371). Further, there was evidence of abuse in both the experimental and control groups. “An unquestioning acceptance of domestic violence batterers’ intervention needs to be challenged” (p.372). While intervention may appear to be a good idea, treatment of the offender – it would seem –  does not necessarily lead to a reduction in domestic violence., Reference: Feder, Lynette and Laura Dugan (2002).

"When do police use force against citizens?  An observational study of police use of force in two American cities suggests that it is not the “disrespect” of the citizen which is a key variable. Instead, suspect and police officer demographic characteristics as well as factors such as the amount of resistance that the suspect exhibits appear to be important determinants of the use of coercive techniques.",", Background.  Although there is a substantial amount of concern about police use of force against citizens, relatively little is known. Focus has largely been on who the citizen is (e.g., race, social class, etc.) and what he/she does (e.g., displays of disrespect toward the police officer) as well as characteristics of the police officer (e.g., background and attitudes). Part of the problem for researchers has been that the interest has often centred on the use of  “excessive” force which is not easily defined., This study examines all force - looked at as a continuum - and assesses the behaviour of citizens throughout their encounters with the police. Accompanying police officers in Indianapolis and St. Petersburg, researchers observed 12,000 police-citizen interactions. A total of 3,116 of these encounters involving interactions between suspects and 270 different police officers were the focus of the present study., Potentially the most unexpected finding was that “[s]uspects who displayed disrespectful behaviour [as coded by the researcher] toward officers were no more likely to have force used on them than were those who were respectful” (p.236). The researchers were reasonably confident that, in most instances, the police officers’ actions were not affected by their presence since many instances existed in which “the observed police behaviour could have been cause for disciplinary action” (p.227). Additional findings showed that force was more likely to be used against subjects who were male, nonwhite, young, poor, or had apparently used alcohol or drugs. Further, suspects who resisted the police officer in some way, were in conflict with another citizen when the police arrived, had a weapon, were arrested, or for whom the evidence of criminal activity was strong were most likely to be subject to force. Beyond suspect characteristics, an analysis of police officer demographic factors also showed that those who were more educated and had more experience were less likely to use force. However, certain other characteristics of police officers (e.g., whether the officer had undergone training in verbal mediation) had no effect on their use of force., Conclusion: It would appear that who a suspect is, as well as what a suspect does, are both important determinants of whether they will be subject to the use of force. The fact that males, nonwhites, poor and young suspects are treated more harshly “irrespective of their behaviour” (p.243) is obviously a concern. In addition, while certain characteristics of the officer (education and experience) are important, others (e.g., attitudes about law enforcement) are not. Clearly, some of these factors are difficult to affect (e.g., the suspect’s behaviour). However, others – the educational level of police officers, and their experience on the job – may constitute promising areas of intervention for reshaping police departments’ approach to this problem., Reference: Terrill, William and Stephen D.

The courts in New York City were able to re-open shortly after September 11 largely because judges took control of the judicial system and challenged the views of other criminal justice officials who argued that the courts would have to remain shut.  Judges succeeded in demonstrating that justice was not to be another victim of terrorism.,"Background.  The court system in New York City was severely threatened by the events of September 11. Many of Manhattan’s principal courthouses are located near the World Trade Centre. Criminal courts depend on police as witnesses. Witnesses, jurors, lawyers, and others need to get to court. The judicial response came from New York’s Chief Judge, Judith S. Kaye who has administrative responsibility for all courts in the state. Her decision, announced mid-morning on September 11, was simple:  The attack had been an assault on America’s values (including justice) and the court system had an obligation to open as soon as possible. That statement set the tone for what happened in the next few weeks. The situation was helped by a dramatic decrease (40%-64% across the 5 boroughs of NYC) in arrests in the month following September 11 as compared to the previous year., Re-opening the courts. Individual judges and court administrators did not have to make any decisions about when to re-open: the “unambiguous imperative to open as soon as practicable” (p. 5) from Judge Kaye meant that individual “administrative judges did not have to weigh arguments about whether to open the courts and could instead focus on how to accomplish that goal” (p. 5). Initially, the courts were told that no police would be available in court for a month.  However, this total ban was lifted several days later. Given that police were involved in rescue efforts, and because of the difficulty in getting cases organized, prosecutors asked for blanket delays. Following Judge Kaye’s statement, judges decided on September 12 that justice required that cases be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. The Mayor’s Criminal Justice Coordinator was based at the Mayor’s Emergency Command Centre - the result of a prior decision made in anticipation of Y2K computer problems. In this way, a mechanism existed to communicate the importance of police appearances in court for more pressing cases. The number of police officers who would be authorized to appear in court was determined by this office in consultation with the chief administrative judge., Some of the work of the criminal courts in Manhattan was moved to other locations. Much of this redistribution was made possible as a result of the leadership of the supervising judge who, along with several prosecutors, had remained in the court during the night of September 11.  Defendants who were in pretrial custody on September 11 were scheduled to be heard within days.  Decisions on whether to proceed with a hearing were made on a case-by-case basis. In this way, delays were allowed only if the prosecutor clearly had tried but could not proceed. “What was unacceptable to the judges, however, was the blanket adjournment of all cases of jailed defendants without an individualized determination of the inability of the district attorney to move that case forward” (p. 15).  Prosecutors asked the governor to suspend the requirement that cases of detained accused be dealt with within strict statutory limits. The governor declined, leaving the judges in charge., On September 19, the administrative judge for the Manhattan courts had a court list of over 300 cases, 245 of which were jail-related.  An assistant district attorney asked for a blanket extension of the statutory limits on dealing with these cases, noting that her office had no telephones, fax or computer communications.  She noted that many police officers were not available.  Judge Martin Murphy, who had slept in the courthouse on the night of September 11 in order to be open the next day, denied the request. He noted that “I think we owe it to everyone to do each case [individually], as laborious as it may be… I think that at some point we have to realize that people have to move forward…. This is a very important institution in the City….” (p. 15).   The court completed all cases at 9:30pm that evening, hearing every case.  None of the release applications were granted over the objection of the prosecutor, but 15 of them were, in fact, conceded (with consent).  An additional 29 cases were resolved by a guilty plea.  As a result of this judicial decision to show leadership in providing “justice as usual”, 90% of the cases had been dealt with in their entirety by the date that the prosecutor had suggested for the blanket extension. A senior prosecutor and the Criminal Justice Coordinator indicated that “no major injustices had been done” (p. 16)., Conclusion. Leadership, in this case from the judges, was crucial.  The initial decision by the Chief Judge to have “justice as usual” was also critical.  Equally important was the “local leadership [that] emerged among both the local administrative judges and senior prosecutors” (p. 24).  Similarly, the firm resolve manifested throughout the system to plan for “business as usual” was fundamental.  For example, one of the difficult matters to resolve was that of communication (e.g., of the location of court hearings) which would reach all of those involved.  In this case, some creativity  (e.g., posted information) and hard work were helpful as were many firm decisions simply to do things, leaving the details to be worked out as they went along., Reference: Root, Oren. 2002.  The Administration of Justice under Emergency Conditions: Lessons Following the Attack on the World Trade Center.  New York: Vera Institute of Justice, Inc., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV4N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-4-no-5-%E2%80%93-march-2002,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 4, No. 5 – March 2002",Regular Issue,2002
"One of the primary reasons for judicial opposition to legislated sentencing guidance is a broad based concern about judges’ loss of discretionary power.  Furthermore, those judges who oppose legislative guidance are likely to overestimate the amount of judicial opposition to sentencing reform.",", Background.  In 1996, the state of Ohio introduced guidelines with rebuttable presumptions in favour of prison sentences for the most serious offences and community sanctions for those of a less serious nature.  Its overall goal was to provide clear guidance on those cases which should result in prison sentences while simultaneously leaving judges broad latitude with regard to the length of the sentence as well as the ability to depart from the guidelines.  Its explicit aim was to leave significantly more discretion with judges than exists with the U.S. federal guidelines, but provide a clear policy and expectation of what would happen., This study reports a survey of the views of almost two thirds of Ohio’s judges after 2 years of experience with the reform. A slim majority (55%) of this judicial sample favoured the guidelines. Those who opposed them believed that their authority had been diminished, that they had not been sufficiently listened to during the guideline development process, and that departures from the guidelines were often necessary. 
 
Judges who opposed the guidelines were significantly more likely to believe that most other judges and prosecutors also opposed them.  In other words, even though the data suggest that more than half of the judges held favourable views of the guidelines, those opposed to them thought that they were in a majority., Much of the opposition appears to relate to three distinct beliefs: 1) violent or dangerous offenders as well as others who should be incarcerated would not be; 2) prison sentences would not be long enough, and 3) correctional resources would not be allocated effectively.  However, some evidence exists that those sentenced to prison were, after the reform was introduced, more likely to be violent and serious offenders.  Thus, much of the opposition to the guidelines comes from explicit disagreement with the premise under which they were introduced in Ohio: to restrict the use of prison for offenders convicted of low-end offences., Conclusion. It is normally assumed that judges will react negatively to anything that restricts their discretion.  Data from this study suggest that the restrictions on judicial discretion need not lead to negative views by the majority of judges.  Although judges in several jurisdictions fairly consistently oppose mandatory determinate sentences, they do not favour a return to the indeterminacy of the past.  Therefore, it may be that much of the judicial opposition to structured guidance in sentencing simply comes from the fact that it involves a change in sentencing practice.   Experience with structured discretion may be responsible for the overall favourable views held by the majority of judges surveyed for this study., Reference: Griffin, Timothy and John Wooldredge. 2001.  Judges’ Reactions to Sentencing Reform in Ohio.

"A police crackdown on drug dealers in London, England which was designed to “stifle the availability of illegal drugs on our streets” (p. 738) was described by the police as a “spectacular success” (p. 738).  However, information obtained from drug users and drug dealers in this city suggests that it had no impact on drug availability or prices.",", Background.  Supply reduction is one of the most common anti-drug interventions in many cities.  The theory is simple: interrupting the supply chain will make it difficult (or expensive) to obtain drugs and, consequently, drug availability and use will decrease.  However, systematic studies of frequent drug users suggest that this population has multiple sources for its drugs (on average, they know more than a dozen dealers)., This study reports on the impact of a November 2000 blitz by the Metropolitan (London, England) police.  In the first two weeks of this well publicized crackdown, more than 240 people were arrested for selling drugs.  After these initial 14 days, drug users were interviewed., The findings question whether the drug crackdown was having its intended impact., However, it should be noted that the possibility exists (though not tested in this paper) that increased police activity may deter irregular users. Nevertheless, this hypothesis seems relatively unlikely given that price and availability to frequent users did not appear to be affected., Conclusion. The findings “offer no support for the suggestion that the markets for heroin, crack and cannabis are sensitive to increased police activity, at least not in the short term, even when such activity is associated with a number of significant drug seizures and with the removal of a large number of dealers from the street” (p. 744). These results support the assertion that “supply reduction endeavours are not strongly linked to illicit drug market forces” (p. 744)., Reference: Best, David; John Strong; Tracy Beswick and Michael Gossop. 2001.

"A policy of ‘cleaning up the streets’ and getting rid of those who make people feel uncomfortable may make good politics, but it does not appear to have much of an impact on crime.",", Background:  Based, in part, on the unsupported “broken-windows” theory of community order, the aggressive enforcement of “disorder offences” has become popular in many cities.  Although there are data to suggest that people who live in socially and physically disordered communities experience more fear, the relationship between disorder and actual crime does not appear to exist., This study examines the impact of “quality of life” policing.  The theory is that such police tactics will send a signal to potential offenders that crime will not be tolerated.  Police in Chandler, Arizona (an area just outside of Phoenix) imposed “quality of life” policing on an economically depressed area of the city.  The targeted location was one in which residents complained about street level illegal drug and alcohol sales, prostitution, and general disrepair of the neighbourhoods. In November 1995, the police began an aggressive policy of enforcement of all municipal codes and county laws, making traffic stops as well as stopping and interviewing residents.  Inspections were increased and people who did not comply with orders were charged. Marked and unmarked cars as well as bicycles were used to increase police presence., The findings were mixed.  The area was divided into four main “zones”. There was some decline in the number of calls to the police concerning public morals matters in three of the four zones.  These decreases lasted beyond the aggressive enforcement period in only two of the four targeted locations. For physical disorder, calls to the police increased during the aggressive policing period but subsequently reverted back to normal levels in three of the four zones, presumably because the police were responding to these matters. However, the effect on “real crime” was less positive.  In some instances, increases rather than decreases occurred in reports of certain crimes in some zones.  Thus, although the aggressive policing strategy may have reduced calls to the police for public morals, there appeared to be some displacement of certain types of offending (e.g., drugs) to adjoining areas., From the perspective of residents, those surveyed were more likely to think that the crime problem had increased (26%) than decreased (19%).  However, they were also more likely to think that the appearance of the neighbourhood had improved (36%) than deteriorated further (10%)., Conclusion. “The program had a far less substantial effect on serious crime than on disorder-related crimes and violations.  In other words, the benefits were restricted primarily to problems on which the project focused specifically…. It may be that “crime” and “grime” are two separate problems, and it is easier for the police to reduce disorder [than to reduce crime]” (p. 89).  This paper supports the conclusion that “[q]uality of life initiatives are often employed without the benefit of careful problem identification or analysis, without any effort to identify underlying conditions and causes, and without careful consideration of a wide range of possible alternatives” (p. 880)., Reference: Katz, Charles; Vincent J.

"School disorder – minor and major – can be best understood by examining two sets of explanatory variables:  characteristics of the youths in the school and characteristics of the school itself. School variables (e.g., school ‘climate’) are important, in large part, because they may be more amenable to change than are characteristics of the youths in the school.",", Background. School disorder has been conceptualized in a variety of different ways (e.g., victimizations, perceptions, incidents of disorder, suspensions, and self-reported offending).  Student victimizations and fear of being victimized appear to have decreased slightly in U.S. schools in 1999 as compared to 1995.  Previous research has demonstrated that “[i]n schools with the worst discipline problems, rules were typically unclear, unfair, or inconsistently enforced, schools made ambiguous or indirect responses to students’ behavior (e.g., lowered grades in response to misconduct); teachers and administrators did not know the rules or disagreed on appropriate responses to students’ misconduct, and students did not believe in the legitimacy of the rules” (p. 920).  Community and individual level factors have also been found to be important., This study examined the impact of student and school characteristics on a variety of measures of school disorder. It found that the various measures of “disorder” listed above are related but measure quite distinct constructs.  However, “school climate variables significantly predicted all five measures of disorder … although the pattern and magnitude of effects differed somewhat for each measure….  For example, two school climate variables, Respect for Students and Fairness of Rules, were strong predictors of both Offending and Misconduct” (p. 938).  “Dimensions of school bonding are related to school disorder in general…  The strongest predictor of Offending was Positive Peer Associations, but Belief in Rules and School Effort [commitment to school] also predicted Misconduct negatively” (p. 939)., Conclusion.  Rather than focusing solely on bad youths as an explanation for school disorder, this study suggests that it may be more useful to realize that “[s]chool disorder can be reduced by conscious efforts on the part of school administrators, teachers, parents, students and community groups….  Individual schools should carefully assess their own climate to determine which factors may be contributing to disorder” (p. 943).  One of the most optimistic findings from this research is its suggestion that schools and school boards can reduce problems of disorder within their institutions not only by choosing ‘good’ youths, but also by creating effective schools.  The environment in which school age children spend their time is clearly important.  Focusing on identifying difficult youths (and, in many jurisdictions, excluding them from school) may not be as effective as concentrating on what could be done to improve the school.  Most of the school climate variables reflect characteristics that have value without reference to disorder. However, by creating a fair environment in which youths want to work hard and, in general, feel attached to school values, one not only gets better schools, but one also gets schools that are relatively free of disorder., Reference: Welsh, Wayne N. 2001.

"Police officers who use force in their professional interactions with citizens are more likely to suffer from occupational stress and ‘burnout’ than those who do not use, or value the use of force against citizens. “Depersonalization, a cynical attitude toward work and civilians, appears to be the key variable related to [police use of force with civilians]” (p.649).",", Background.  Stress in police officers appears to relate, to some extent, to the inherent nature of police work (e.g., physical threat, facing the unknown, shift work).  However, the most salient factors causing stress in police officers were organizational variables such as a lack of confidence in management, lack of internal communication, and continuous organizational changes.  Occupational burnout in general is seen as having at least three dimensions: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization (i.e., a callous and cynical attitude toward the people with whom one deals), and a decrease in personal accomplishments.  With the police, some evidence exists that burnout is associated most strongly with depersonalization., This study examined police burnout in the Netherlands. Police officers were observed in their everyday work as well as asked to complete a questionnaire. Job burnout was captured by a 20-question measurement instrument inquiring about matters of emotional exhaustion (e.g., “I feel emotionally drained by my work”), depersonalization (e.g., “I don’t really care what happens to citizens”), and personal accomplishment (e.g., “I deal effectively with the problems of citizens”) (p. 637).  Data on the use of force were obtained through independent observations, attitudes concerning its legitimacy, and self-reported use of force by police., Police officers most often mentioned organizational factors (rather than characteristics of the job) as sources of stress. Self-reported use of force and observed use of force were correlated.  Both measures related to feelings of “depersonalization” – the callous and cynical view of citizens. Burnout scores -- in particular, depersonalization – were higher for officers who used physical or verbal force with citizens., Conclusion. Obviously, police occasionally use force in their daily work.  Such use of force can, of course, be legitimate and easily attributed to the situation.  In this study, however,  “all observed force was conducted by officers scoring high on emotional exhaustion and depersonalization… Officers who are cynical and detached were more readily inclined to use force against civilians. This suggests a typical negative interaction pattern, whereby the depersonalized officers behave more forcefully toward civilians, who will, in response, react in an unfriendly and less cooperative manner; such responses will reinforce the negative attitudes the officer had about civilians” (p. 648)., Reference: Kop, Nicolien and Martin C.

"Three legal responses to domestic violence – arrest, a protective (or restraining) order (e.g., a court imposed prohibition on contacting the victim or going near the victim’s home/place of employment), or a combination of both of these interventions – have been found to have no differential impact on the likelihood of revictimization of the spouse.",", Background. Because it is now fairly well established that mandatory arrest policies in domestic violence cases do not, by themselves, act to protect women from being revictimized, attention has turned toward other interventions that can be imposed by the justice system. Protective orders (similar to Canada’s “peace bonds” under S. 810 of the Criminal Code) have been, in the past few decades, a popular approach. This type of legal response is based on the theory that women might be more willing to seek them than criminal justice intervention and men would be less likely to retaliate.  In 1976, only two states had implemented “protective orders” as a possible strategy against wife assault. By 1994, all 50 states had adopted them., This study examined the revictimization of 336 women in Texas who were originally assaulted by their spouses. These men were subsequently either arrested, issued a protective order, or both.  A two-year follow-up permitted the authors to determine whether the offender revictimized the woman, and if so, the length of time between the original offence and the subsequent assault., The results show no differences among the three groups (arrest, protective order, arrest and protective order).  Race and income were associated with revictimization (blacks and the poor were more likely to be revictimized). An attempt was made to discover whether particular sub-groups of women would benefit from certain interventions.  None of the combinations of variables led to a decrease in the likelihood of revictimization., Conclusion. Legal remedies – protective orders or arrests – do not appear to be useful in addressing a complex problem such as wife assault.  Presumably, it is not the legal intervention per se that would be likely to make any difference. Rather, only something that has a life above and beyond its existence on a piece of paper is likely to reduce this kind of revictimization., Reference: Mears, Daniel P.; Matthew J. Carlson; George W.

"Uncanny parallels exist between the way in which juvenile crime in Sweden and Canada has been described.  Although certain selective comparisons based on Swedish data would suggest that youth violence has increased and/or become more brutal, overall trends show no important changes in youth violence in the past decade.",", Background. Europe has sometimes been included with the United States as jurisdictions showing an increase in youth violence.  As one influential paper suggests, “an increase in youth violence has been apparent in the United States and in ten European countries [including Sweden]” (Pfeiffer, 1998. Crime and Justice: A review of research, p. 255)., This paper, in contrast, demonstrates that the belief that Swedish youth violence has increased reflects a somewhat selective view of the facts.  Looking at a range of different indicators of youth violence, it finds that there are, certainly, large fluctuations over time.  However, increases can only be demonstrated by choosing very special data to compare. For instance, “[f]or 15-19 year olds, admissions [to public hospitals] during the 1990s lie at exactly the same level as they did during the second half of the 1970s” (p. 644). However, if 1986 and 1995 are compared (as was done in the paper referred to above), it would appear that a large increase had occurred., School violence follows a similar pattern to that which we have seen in North America. Estrada’s description of the situation in Sweden could well be applied to Canada or the U.S.: “There is evidence of a change in the way acts of violence in schools are viewed and in attitudes toward the kind of responses such acts should be met with.  During the first half of the 1980s, a fairly clear line is drawn between more and less serious forms of physical violence.  Less serious incidents would in general not be reported to the police, but would rather be dealt with internally by the school.  During the second half of the decade, on the other hand, there is already evidence of a tendency to advocate contacting the police even in the event of less serious forms of disorder.  During the 1990s, this tendency becomes more pronounced” (p. 649). Not surprisingly, in Stockholm between the early 1980s and the late 1990s, the school moved from being the source of only 29% of the reported assaults to that of 60% of the cases.  School violence cases “accounted for more than 80% of the increase in recorded cases [of violence]” (p. 650).  Victimization data of youths aged 16-24 show no clear consistent linear increases in the levels of violence requiring medical attention or bodily injury., An examination of media stories about youth crime shows quite a different pattern. In 1986, “a new image is presented of the young perpetrator.  He is portrayed as polite, emotionally cold and unpredictable.  He assaults others for kicks.  The social factors are pushed into the background…. The image of the juvenile offender [that has been established by 1987] is that of a calculating ‘super-predator’, a hardened young delinquent whom society needs to protect itself against” (p. 648)., Conclusion: “Over the last 10 years, the theme of ‘rising juvenile violence’ has become widely pervasive in the general social discourse around Europe…. The greater focus in the public in general is perceived as a reflection of the real underlying trend… In this way the (more or less erroneous) portrayal of juvenile crime as continually on the increase in fact comes to be seen as reflecting reality” (p. 652).  Without doubt, the result is that policies which pander to this (nonexistent) increase receive public support., Reference: Estrada, Felipe.  Juvenile Violence as a Social Problem: Trends, Media Attention and Societal Response. 2001.  British Journal of Criminology 41: 639-655., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV4N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-4-no-5-%E2%80%93-march-2002,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 4, No. 5 – March 2002",Regular Issue,2002
"Adjournments in court appear to have more to do with “court culture” than with the case itself.  If judges create a culture in which court adjournments are permitted, these delays will inevitably occur.  If they want cases to be dealt with quickly and efficiently, that, too, is within their power.","Background: Adjournments - requested by either party in a court case - can be important in that they interfere with the efficient resolution of disputes. In criminal trials, adjournments can not only impact the accused but also constitute an inconvenience for victims and other witnesses.  Some adjournments are clearly necessary. Studies of court delay have identified certain predictable factors associated with case processing speed (e.g., case complexity, strength of evidence, plea decisions). However, these studies also show variation in case processing times between courts that cannot be explained by these structural factors., This study examines the importance of “court culture” – “beliefs and practices shared by personnel, such as judges, solicitors and clerks, working in a particular court” (p. 43) - in four Scottish Sheriff’s Courts in 1999-2001. In the context of adjournments, it is suggested that court culture includes “shared views about ways of doing things (such as what constitutes an acceptable speed of case processing) and shared expectations and norms (such as solicitors’ expectations regarding the likely judicial response to an adjournment request)” (p. 43)., The basic findings are easy to describe. One of the courts was dramatically different from the other three. In “Court D”, 7% of the cases were adjourned on the day that trial was set. The average for Courts A, B, and C was 31% (range: 28-33%).  The judge has the power to adjourn or refuse to adjourn a case “in the interests of justice” (p. 47). In Courts A, B & C, requests for adjournments were rarely questioned and seldom opposed. Judges intervened only if the adjournment requests were disputed. There was an expectation that the first trial date would be adjourned. Adjournments were often agreed to in advance by the lawyers and presented to the court as “a done deal” (p.48). Conversely, judges in Court D asked for reasons as to why an adjournment was being requested, even if the adjournment was not opposed by the lawyer on the other side. These judges, who are described as working closely with one another, indicate that they try to deal with as many cases as possible and see adjournments as impediments to this goal. Lawyers indicated that they had to “work in a different way in order to cope with the court culture in Court D” (p. 50)., Conclusion: Court culture – shared expectations about how things should work – clearly can affect the efficiency of the criminal justice system. “Something can be done to prevent unnecessary adjournments and the power to effect change lies primarily with judges … The prevailing culture [in these four courts] was not ‘shared’ as such but was judge-led… [supporting] the conclusion … that the attitude of judges is critical in setting court culture” (p. 51). “The incidence of unnecessary adjournments can be lessened by a willingness on the part of judges to question both disputed and undisputed adjournment requests more thoroughly” (p. 52).  Judges, it would seem, can lead the way toward more effective court processes, but only if they wish to do so., Reference:  Leverick, Fiona and Peter Duff.

"Providing lawyers to indigent tenants in landlord-tenant disputes helped keep the clients from being evicted.  Further, having a lawyer did not result in additional court time.",", Background. Although it is often assumed that having a lawyer in simple disputes will benefit a client, there is little evidence that this is actually the case. In landlord-tenant disputes in New York, landlords are typically represented, but tenants are not (78% of landlords but only 21% of tenants in one study were found to have lawyers in housing court)., This study examined the impact of providing free lawyers to indigent tenants in housing court where it was believed that the tenant would be likely to be evicted.  Needy tenants were randomly assigned to receive legal advice (full representation or legal assistance). Control clients were told that it was unfortunately not possible to provide help. “Treatment” clients were provided either with a lawyer or legal assistance and/or advice. In actuality, most (56%) of the “treatment” clients were provided with lawyers. Only 4% of the control clients ended up retaining their own lawyers., The findings were clear:, This last finding is important in that it suggests that part of the benefit of a lawyer is to organize the case in such a way as to convince tenants that they have a chance of winning. As a result, they may be more likely to follow through with the process. Further, the provision of a lawyer to poor clients did not place additional burdens on the court., Conclusion. In this random assignment study of the impact of lawyers, it appears that clients with lawyers had better outcomes with very few negative effects on court efficiency. Although cases took longer to complete if they had a lawyer, this cost needs to be balanced against the fact that without lawyers, clients clearly are not getting the results which they deserve. Judges in this particular court “have a reputation for fairness and for providing guidance” (p. 430) to unrepresented clients. Clearly, however, even a sympathetic judge cannot assure a fair outcome to an unrepresented client., Reference: Seron, Carroll, Gregg Van Ryzin, and Martin Frankel. (2001).

"The art of surviving and, ultimately, being effective as a prison officer may involve more negotiation and the wise use of discretion than simple compliance with rules. Similar to police officers, the discretionary use of rules as resources may be an important tool for correctional officers.",", Background. Research on policing has focused on the “exercise, nature, and control of discretion…” (p. 334).  Conversely, work on prison officers has tended to ignore the concept of discretion, focusing instead on rule compliance., This study examined the everyday manner in which the exercise of discretion by prison officers operates. It notes that the “peacekeeping aspects of [prison officers’] work … has been neglected [as a topic of study]” (p.343). Like police officers, correctional officers “enforce their authority rather than the rules. They understand that ‘the decent thing’ is selectively to underenforce the law, in order that the smooth flow of prison can continue…. They make choices, use judgements, sometimes to achieve justice, where the rules do not work, and sometimes to assert their authority…. Like police officers, prison officers made efforts to provide security, stability and safety in prison … through surveillance, the threat of sanctioning and the art of persuasion.  Their role includes presence and patrol, the investigation of suspected ‘threats to order’ and the use of formal and informal sanctions” (pp. 343-4). Hence, rules are resources to be used to achieve certain goals. Prisoners understood this. Relationships between prisoners and prison guards also matter., There are two models of prison work: the ‘rule following/compliance model’ and the ‘negotiation model’ (p. 346). While the former is the approach favoured by policy makers and management, the latter is the one which is actually delivered. Dangers exist with both.  Prison managers and prisoners agreed that the best staff were those who “accept and use discretion wisely” (p. 346). Staff who are seen by both groups as appropriate role models were described as having justifiable boundaries which were consistently applied and known to inmates - “something that was referred to as ‘moral courage’ or ‘moral fibre’; sensitivity to the effects of their own power; and a sensitivity to individuals and contexts…” (p. 346). “Consistency of principle meant that judicious flexibility in the application of the rules was a possibility. In the absence of any clearly articulated organizational principles, good staff developed or applied their own” (p. 346). It was noted that good prison officers (in the eyes of other officers and inmates) under-use power more than over-use it., From a management perspective, the gap that exists is between the world in which rules are there to be enforced and a world in which rules are there to be used as resources for the effective running of the prison. In the first model, process, audit and compliance are valued. In contrast, the second model emphasizes tradition, accommodation and daily survival (p. 349)., Conclusion: It may be that the most effective prison officers are not those who are driven by “the rule of law” – enforcing every rule and procedure. Instead, the most effective officer - from the perspective of other officers and prisoners - may be the one who is guided by principles more than rules, negotiation more than enforcement, and results more than process., Reference: Liebling, Alison.

"Cracks are developing in the imprisonment policies of several states in the USA. Indeed, imprisonment has turned out not to be all that it was cracked up to be.",", Background: Crime rates in the U.S. dropped in many cities and states during the 1990s. Consequently, statements about crime being out of control have lost their shine as attractive elements of political rhetoric. Getting “tough” on an ever decreasing number of offenders is not the vote-getter in this century that tough talk was a decade earlier. As alternative strategies for dealing with those who offend – e.g., drug courts, restorative approaches – become more popular, the support for prisons as a one-(jumbo)-size-fits-all solution has begun to fade. The economic decline that began in 2001 has forced state legislatures to examine their expenditures. As a result, prisons are suddenly not as attractive as they once were., The result of the decline in the attractiveness of prisons as political institutions is that state legislatures in the United States have begun to roll back their pro-prison policies. Examples include the following:
Certain mandatory minimum sentences have been eliminated or reduced. Louisiana did this by imposing the 3-strikes requirement that all 3 offences be violent, sex, or drug crimes punishable by at least 10 years in prison rather than just any three felonies.
Mississippi has allowed certain non-violent offenders to become eligible for parole earlier in their sentences. 
North Dakota has eliminated mandatory minimum sentences for certain drug offences.
California (as a result of a referendum) has mandated drug treatment programs in place of previously required imprisonment. It is estimated that this single change will free up 11,000 prison beds (equivalent to about 40% of Canada’s total prison capacity). 
Idaho had planned on building one new prison every 2 years for the “foreseeable future” (p. 7) but, instead, expanded its drug treatment programs. 
Montana now diverts certain drinking-drivers to treatment rather than prison. 
Texas presently releases chronically ill inmates from the prison system., In total, 11 states have plans to reduce correctional budgets. Ten states have considered delaying prison construction and/or closing facilities. For example, Missouri has, as the result of a state budget cut, delayed the opening of an already built facility which cost $168 million to construct., Conclusion. Policy makers are apparently now “aware that sentencing and corrections policy choices have both short-term and long-term considerations” (p. 17). It would appear that legislators are also seeing that prison cell construction attracts prisoners and continuing costs. As prison populations decline, state officials are becoming more aware of the importance of “prison re-entry” programs. The shine has come off the spanking new prison – public or private. Thirty years of “increased punishment” policies suddenly do not look so good., Reference: King, Ryan S. and Marc Mauer. (2002).

Ineffective parenting leads to delinquency. Ineffective parenting of delinquent youths increases as a result of a youth’s contact with the criminal justice system. A youth’s contact with the criminal justice system as an offender accounts for “both continuity in antisocial activities and disruptions in parenting practices” (p. 36).,", Background.  A substantial amount of research has shown that ineffective parenting – e.g., harsh parenting, punitive discipline and poor supervision of youths – leads to increased delinquency in adolescents. However, “there is an increasing body of research that suggests that delinquency is not merely an outcome but a process variable that affects and is affected by parenting in an interactional process” (p. 37).  Delinquency and bad parenting may each increase the other., This paper suggests that “delinquency is most apt to have negative consequences when resulting in official responses by legal authorities” (p. 37). It is noted that legal sanctions disrupt the quality of family life by embarrassing the parents, thus increasing conflict and subsequent stress levels in the family., The study looks at youths at three different points in time (average age: 13.5, 14.5, and 15.5 years). Poor parenting was assessed using self-reports by parents as well as systematic observations by survey interviewers. Delinquency of the youth was assessed by way of a self-report questionnaire. Youths also reported whether they had come into contact with the justice system as well as the type of contact which had occurred., Delinquency and parenting were examined at ages 13.5 and 15.5. At age 14.5, the youths were asked about contact with the justice system as offenders. The statistical model that was used looked at changes in delinquency and parenting (from age 13.5 to 15.5)., The findings demonstrate that poor parenting at age 13.5 was associated with increased delinquency at age 15.5. However, about half of this effect was due to the impact of legal sanctions occurring between these two ages. Not surprisingly, those youths who were most involved in delinquency and most subject to poor parenting practices at age 13.5 were most likely to receive legal sanctions. However, the impact of poor parenting practices at age 13.5 was largely mediated by the occurrence of legal sanctions., Similarly, poor parenting at age 15.5 was associated with higher levels of delinquency at age 13.5. This effect was almost completely due to the impact of legal sanctions that took place between age 13.5 and age 14.5., Conclusion: “Poor parenting behaviours led to increases in delinquency and earlier delinquency led to an increase in poor parenting” (p. 52). Legal sanctions were a result of delinquency and poor parenting at age 13.5. “Legal sanctions, in turn, predicted further increases in delinquency and decreases in parenting quality a year later at [age 15.5]” (p. 52). Clearly, there are negative effects of increased contact with the criminal justice system. Consequently, laws that minimize this impact (e.g., by reducing formal entry into the court, probation, or custodial systems) may ultimately end up reducing recidivism., Reference: Stewart, Eric A., Ronald L. Simons, Rand D. Conger, and Laura V. Scaramella. (2002). Beyond the Interactional Relationship between Delinquency and Parenting Practices: The Contribution of Legal Sanctions.

Why aren’t we able to predict serious school violence?  Because it (thankfully) happens very rarely and because we probably ask the wrong questions.,", Background: The response to incidents of serious school violence is often dramatic, thoughtless, and probably not effective. For instance, New York City spent $28 million on metal detectors in the mid-1990s. As well, various school districts have recently implemented school uniform policies (on the theory, apparently, that gang members will not wear them). These policies need to be evaluated in light of the fact that fewer than 1% of the homicides and suicides among school-age children in the U.S. happen in or around schools. “School hours are probably the safest time of the day for adolescents” (p. 797)., This study begins by examining the question of why serious incidents of school violence cannot be predicted. The reasons are as follows:, On the other hand, if violence were identified as a dynamic, rather than static process, one might look for changes that increase the likelihood of violence. The challenge may be that rather than using personality tests, etc., information about youths who are “in trouble” may be available from other students in the school situation. The problem that this approach creates is obvious: “Giving information about the problems that another student is having or about threats or scary activities going on in a school environment can occur only if students feel that they are, and will remain, safe and that a reasoned response will result from their reporting… Ironically, many schools appear to be taking the opposite approach… Schools are implementing zero-tolerance polices that virtually guarantee an unreasoned response to any reported problem” (p. 800, emphasis added).  Given that attachments to family and schools serve as protective factors against violence, the promotion of healthy relationships and environments is more effective for reducing school misconduct and crime than instituting punitive penalties., Conclusion: “Preventing violent incidents in school does not require either more sophisticated methods for assessing students individually or a magical uniform method for intervening with them for a short while after they have been identified. It seems instead to rest largely on developing a positive and supportive organizational climate in a school” (p. 800)., Reference:  Mulvey, Edward P. and Elizabeth Cauffman. (October, 2001).

Police assessments of suspects’ character and the race of the accused are important in understanding who is detained in custody awaiting trial in Toronto.,", Background. Bail laws can be conceptualized as theoretical tools used to assess risk (e.g. of the accused not appearing for trial or committing another offence). However, they may also have more concrete consequences for the detainee which extend beyond the simple reduction of his/her risk level. For example, an accused who is detained in custody awaiting trial is not only being punished for an offence that has not yet been proven, but is also put at a disadvantage in later proceedings. In particular, there is evidence from previous research suggesting that those in pre-trial detention are more likely to be found guilty and incarcerated than those who are allowed to remain in the community before their trial., This study looks at the more than 1800 bail decisions in Toronto courts in 1993-4. It examines hypotheses related to the notion that bail decisions relate to moral assessments made about the accused person. The researchers had access not only to data describing court proceedings, but also to information about the case that the Crown received from the police., The findings demonstrate that even after legally relevant factors were controlled for (e.g., the accused having a permanent address, the number of charges, the presence of certain types of criminal record), race contributed significantly to the decision of whether an accused person received a pre-trial detention order: black accused are more likely to be detained than those from other racial backgrounds. However, the effect of race is indirect: “The more negative the police moral assessment of an accused person, the more likely they are to be held in custody” (p. 196) above and beyond legally relevant variables. This factor – negative moral assessments by the police – explains the race effect since “police provide more negative character assessments of black accused than white accused or accused from other racial groups” (p. 196). This appears to be the mechanism by which black accused are more likely to be detained., In general, accused who are remanded in custody are considerably more likely to plead guilty to one or more charges that they are facing. Additionally, accused who have been released into the community are more likely to have all charges against them withdrawn. In contrast, black accused persons who are detained in custody are less likely to plead guilty than white accused persons who are in pre-trial detention. If released, blacks and others are equally likely to plead guilty.  Although black people being detained are less likely to plead guilty than other groups, blacks in custody are more likely than accused from other groups to have all of their charges eventually withdrawn (17% vs. 8%).  Those accused who were held in pre-trial detention but did, in the end, have all charges withdrawn spent an average of 103 days in custody before release., Conclusion: By defining what kind of person an accused is (independent of legal factors), the police have a direct impact on whether an accused is released on bail. Through this mechanism, black accused are more likely to be detained.  Blacks who are detained are, compared to accused from other racial groups, less likely to plead guilty but are more likely to have all charges eventually withdrawn. The added difficulty is that “the informality of certain bail practices combines with the confidentiality of police documents to render invisible the way in which personal identity [of the accused] influences the outcomes of both bail decisions and plea bargaining” (p. 205)., Reference: Kellough, Gail and Scot Wortley.

"Domestic abuse does not occur in a vacuum.  Although victims are not responsible for their victimization, it does appear that “a mutual relationship process” involving both partners may explain some intimate violence. In these cases, treatments focused exclusively on the offender may not be as effective as those which recognize the dyadic process of domestic abuse.",", Background. It is well established that although most spousal violence involves women as victims, some also involves male victims. However, the severity of violence directed at men by their female partners is less than that directed by men toward women. Though some of the violence by women against their male partners may involve self-defence, it appears that male and female violence may have similar predictors and correlates., This study examines 360 young New Zealand couples with the goal of understanding whether “abuse is a dyadic process involving risk characteristics of both couple members” (p. 7). In particular, it evaluates the role of “negative emotionality” (NEM) in spousal abuse. NEM was assessed by self-reports of the reactions of both partners to stress. Questions included partners’ level of agreement to questions such as “I often get irritated at little annoyances” and “When someone hurts me, I try to get even” (p.7). High scorers have low thresholds for feeling tense, hostile, and angry” (p.7). The majority of the couples studied were in dating or cohabiting relationships. Only 7% were married. Most were considered to be of relatively low socio-economic status. Almost ¾ of the relationships had lasted for more than a year., The findings. Because the study used data on self-reported abuse and victimization obtained independently from each partner, “validity” could be assessed. Roughly ¾ of the reports were corroborated. The findings can be summarized as follows:
Both men and women who scored high in NEM were likely to abuse their spouses. 
Both men and women who were found to be high in NEM were likely to be victims, even after controlling for the partner’s NEM. 
When both partners were high in NEM, the likelihood of mutual abuse was highest.
Both men and women in “clinically” abusive relationships (i.e. those with abuse resulting in injury or professional interventions) had high levels of NEM., Conclusion. In this sample of young couples, negative emotionality predicted risk for abuse (both as a victim and as an offender). One partner in each couple had been assessed for this characteristic at an earlier time, before most couples had formed. Thus, negative emotionality did not appear to be a result of the experience of abuse in the couple. These findings support the growing evidence “that self-defense cannot explain all of the abuse committed by women” (p. 26). Subject to further replication - particularly for different age groups and types of interpersonal relationships – the results of this study may be important in suggesting that interventions addressing the negative emotionality of both offenders and victims may be more effective for some couples than strategies that focus solely on the offender., Reference: Moffitt, Terrie E., Richard W.

Americans are beginning to tire of ‘tough on crime’ policies and are turning to prevention rather than prisons as a more appropriate response to crime.,"Background. American politicians have successfully run election campaigns using crime as their vehicle to public office. It appears that things have changed somewhat since the peak of crime in the early part of the 1990s. Since that time, crime – particularly violent crime in the U.S. – has leveled off in many states while imprisonment rates have hit all time highs (with 2 million Americans in state or federal prisons or jails). A recent survey of public attitudes shows the following:, In terms of what to do now, the picture is clear:, Conclusion. “There is widespread agreement that the [American] nation’s existing approach to criminal justice is off-target” (p.6). It would seem that Americans are looking for effective ways of addressing the real problems of crime. Public opinion surveys in the past year suggest that there has been a shift from punitiveness to effectiveness. In the past, politicians appear to have led rather than followed the public toward harsh policies (see Beckett, Making Crime Pay. Oxford, 1997).  Currently, they would seem well advised to change direction if they wish to stay in step with their constituencies., Reference: Peter D. Hart Research Associates (2002).

"Police officers against whom complaints are most often made also tend to be the most active members on a force. However, they are more likely to use physical force as well.",", Background.  Citizen complaints against police officers (e.g., for rude or aggressive behaviour) do not appear to be randomly distributed. Some police officers are more likely to be subject to complaints than others. Three theories exist regarding the meaning or significance of police complaints. First, it is possible that complaints tell us little (if anything) about the subject (i.e. the police officer) of the complaint. The second possibility is that a police officer who is the subject of a disproportionately large number of complaints is a potential problem individual. In this case, the complaints serve as a measure of inappropriate police behaviour. Third, it is possible that complaints are an indicator of high levels of police productivity. This is to say that police officers who are subject to a high number of complaints may simply be more active and more likely to place themselves in situations in which complaints might be elicited (e.g., in arrests or proactive stops of citizens). Logically, a police officer who does nothing is unlikely to be the subject of a citizen complaint., This study examined the behaviour of St. Petersburg, Florida police during their ordinary shifts. Observers watched 94 police officers who had been the subject of either a disproportionately high number of complaints (at least one a year) or no more than one per five years. Their use of force or discourtesy was recorded, as well as the rate at which they issued “commands” to citizens, searched them, etc.. Ordinary “encounters” with citizens who were suspects or disputants were also counted., The results are straightforward and lend support to both the second and third hypotheses., Conclusion. This study involving the systematic observation of police officers supports two of the proposed major perspectives. In comparison with police officers with few complaints against them, those who are subject to a large number of complaints had a higher likelihood of placing themselves in situations in which complaints tend to emerge (e.g., interrogations and proactive stops). However, they are also more apt to use a greater number of forceful tactics against those citizens whom they encounter., Reference: Terrill, William and John McCluskey (2002).

Assessing psychopathy in youthful offenders is almost certain to result in ordinary adolescents being labelled as psychopaths.,", Background.  Research on adult psychopathy has noted that these individuals often displayed antisocial behaviour as youths. Based on this finding, researchers have begun looking for ways to identify “fledgling psychopaths” (p.219). Particularly with public concern with youth crime, it is not surprising that efforts to predict violence inevitably have started to focus on “juvenile psychopathy.” This paper (as well as the commentaries that follow it) examines the dangers in such an approach., The difficulties with such a strategy are multiple in nature. First, the relatively transient quality of behavioural patterns in normal adolescence make it likely that assessment with measures adapted from adult instruments have a high probability of identifying normal youths as psychopaths. In addition, and although some of these measures have already been developed, they have not yet been sufficiently validated, nor do they yet have published guidelines on their use. These deficiencies are problematic. For example, if the existing assessment tools are to be useful, they must measure stable traits. Yet, “there have been no published studies using the instruments… at different points in time during … childhood or adolescence” (p.232). Moreover, “no published studies have addressed whether high psychopathy scores in adolescence predict high psychopathy scores in adulthood, much less a higher risk of violent and other antisocial conduct in adulthood” (p.234). Further problems exist in interpreting any even short term predictability from these measures. Indeed, some studies have shown weak relationships between juvenile psychopathy and offending, but have not even attempted to control for other known “risk” factors such as substance abuse or ADHD., Interestingly, supporters of efforts to measure psychopathy such as Stephen Hart at Simon Fraser University agree with the call for caution with respect to the infiltration of adolescence by the merchants of psychopathy. As Hart notes, “there is no consensus among developmental psychopathologists that a personality disorder as a general class of psychopathology even exists in childhood or adolescence… There are good reasons… to believe that personality does not crystallize until at least late adolescence or even early adulthood… If stable personality does not exist… then surely personality disorder cannot” (p.242). In addition, the limited information “used to assess juvenile psychopathy imposes a limit on the accuracy and reliability of the assessment” (p.243). Other researchers note that the concerns raised with respect to psychopathy hold for other measures of psychopathology as well (pp. 248-9)., Conclusion. Psychopathy has become popular in adult criminal justice because of the claims made concerning its predictive value. However, a set of serious “conceptual problems bedevil research in this area” (p.244) when applied to youth. Particularly since “no one knows if what appear to be traits of psychopathy in childhood or adolescence persist across even short periods of time”, it would appear that the advice of experts to beware of the psychopathy sellers would be worth heeding., References: Seagrave, Daniel and Thomas Grisso (2002).

Sex offenders are not reconvicted at the rate that many people think they are. Parole boards over-predict re-offending for these prisoners. The notion that certain groups of sex offenders are driven to commit additional sex offences on release is challenged by this study.,", Background.  “There is a widespread assumption in the mass media and probably amongst the public… that sex offenders (especially those who offend against children) are particularly prone to repeat their crimes” (p.371). However, the data on reconviction tend to challenge this assumption (see, for examples, Highlights Vol. 3, No. 3, Item 3). It is not reconviction per se that is important. Rather, it is the type of offence that is clearly of most concern., This study followed 174 male prisoners who had been convicted of a serious sex offence in the U.K. for at least 2 years after release and, in the case of 94 of them, for 6 years. These offenders were subsequently divided into groups (e.g., adult vs. child victim, male or female child victims, stranger or known victim, single vs. multiple victims, whether the offence against a child had taken place within the family unit). 60% of these offenders had at least one child victim, approximately one quarter of whom were male. Parole board hearings were also monitored which allowed the researchers to determine whether an offender had been described as posing a ‘high risk’ (p.373)., The results suggest a pattern of reconviction that is lower than most definitions of ‘high risk.’ [Note, of course, that the study deals only with reconvictions. Presumably there could have been some re-offending that was not reported or in which the offender was not apprehended.]
6.7% (11) of the 162 offenders who had been in the community for at least 4 years had been reconvicted of a sexual offence. Of the 6 who had previously been convicted of an offence involving an adult, all but one were reconvicted of an offence against an adult. Four of the other 5 whose original offences involved children were reconvicted for offences against children. 
An additional 5.6% (9) were reconvicted of a (non-sexual) violent offence., An examination of the 94 who had been out for six years or more shows that 8.5% had been reconvicted for a sexual offence and imprisoned during this period and another 4.3% (4) were reconvicted for a violent offence and also incarcerated. A total of 18.1% (17) were imprisoned for some offence. An additional 12.8% (12) were reconvicted for some other offence but not sent to prison. In total, 30.9% were reconvicted but most of these were clearly not for sexual offences., Looking only at the 6-year follow-up of those who had originally offended against children, none of the 31 whose victims had been within the family were reconvicted of a sexual or violent offence and imprisoned. Of the 19 who were originally convicted for extra-familial offences against children, 6 (32%) were reconvicted for a sexual or violent offence and were incarcerated. The 6-year reconviction rates for offenders against children and offenders whose victims were exclusively adults were not dramatically different, with the exception of those whose child victim was in the family. None of these individuals were reconvicted for a violent or sexual offence., 92% of those identified as “high risk” by a member of the parole board were not reconvicted of a sexual offence within four years. However, the parole board had also labelled all but one of the repeat sexual offenders as high risk. By “over-predicting” risk, those who re-offended as well as those who did not were identified. A statistical device used to make predictions was moderately related to reconviction, although 13 of the 22 identified as “high risk” (59%) were not reconvicted., Conclusion. Reconviction rates for most groups of sex offenders are lower than they are typically assumed to be. In particular, the notion that those who offend against children will, almost invariably, be reconvicted is challenged by these data. Parole board assessments of risk can be seen as “correct” because they have a high rate of seeing “high risk”. Hence, they accurately identify the repeat sexual and dangerous offenders but also identify a large number who are not, in fact, reconvicted., Reference: Hood, Roger, Stephen Shute, Martina Feilzer, and Aidan Wilcox (2002).

"Intuitive profiling – the assertion that the accused fits the informal stereotype of the type of person likely to commit the crime in question – is liable to be deceptive, even though courts have deemed it to be probative evidence.",", Background.  A man is charged with the killing of his wife. It is argued that the fact that he had been unfaithful to her constitutes evidence that he killed her, rather than, as argued by the defence, she died accidentally. Intuitively, the court decides that unfaithful husbands are more likely to kill their wives than faithful husbands and subsequently admits the evidence on that ground. What’s wrong with this?  Lots, it turns out., This paper examines the issue of intuitive profiling and notes that sensible ways of evaluating this evidence exist but are rarely understood. A simple example is presented using the above-mentioned scenario. Imagine that we are looking at the behaviour of 1 million men. US data would suggest that we might expect 26% of them to be unfaithful to their wives. Independently, the maximum probability that a man would kill his wife at some point during the marriage might be estimated as 240 per million married men. If one further assumes the maximum relationship between these two variables, one would assert that all 240 married men who killed their spouses had been unfaithful (see table)., These data lead to the following outcome: the probability of murder if faithful is (hypothetically) zero.  The probability of murder if unfaithful is 240/260,000 or .09%. Said differently, 99.91% of the unfaithful men did not kill their wives. Thus, “one can conclude that at maximum it is… less than 1/10 of 1% more likely that an unfaithful man will murder his wife at some point in their marriage than it is that a faithful man will murder his wife” (p.138)., In general, it turns out that the usefulness of a predictor is smallest when the base rate of the behaviour (the crime) is low and the base rate of the predictor is relatively high. “Unfortunately, for many (if not most) of the profiling predictors in the legal system, the base rate of the predictor far exceeds the base rate of the crime. Thus the predictor will not be probative – either at all, or sufficiently to outweigh its potential prejudicial value” (p.139). For example, it is shown that “intention to dissolve [a] marriage [on the part of a man] is not meaningfully more probative [of killing one’s wife] than infidelity” (p.144). Multiple predictors improve matters somewhat as long as they are largely unrelated and the predictor itself has a low base rate. Further, base rates themselves clearly have to be established for relevant populations. In the table above, the base rate of wife-killing varies with certain population characteristics., Conclusion. Information such as the unfaithfulness of a man accused of killing his wife is often admitted in court without the analysis showing that it only improves the accuracy of a judgment by 1/10 of 1%. It appears that decision makers (i.e. judges, juries, parole boards) may well be “falling prey to the tendency to assume that if an item of evidence… fits their intuitive stereotype or causal theory of those associated with a specific criminal behavior, the evidence is usefully probative of guilt” (p.150). The problem becomes more acute with multiple examples of high rate evidence. It is suggested that estimating the actual value of this evidence – as done in the example above – may reduce the prejudicial value of the evidence., Reference: Davis, Deborah and William C.

The two currently ‘hot’ models of modern policing – community policing and broken-windows policing – have sometimes been described as complementary in nature. There are serious concerns about seeing them in this way.,", Background. Two paradigms have developed in the past several decades on how the police can reduce crime. “Broken windows policing” (a.k.a., order maintenance policing or quality of life policing) is based on the assertion that low level disorder breeds higher level disorder. It justifies a focus on vagrancy, beggars or prostitutes because the reduction of these problems is seen as a mechanism for preventing robbery or murder. Community policing describes the solution to crime as being a partnership between police and the community in defining both the problem and the solutions. “These philosophies for bringing about change in policing practices are frequently conflated, most notably in the popular press” (p.446)., This paper suggests that broken windows has “emerged as the dominant applied approach” (p.446) in many areas for three reasons. First, it fits police culture. Second, it is consistent with cultural understanding of crime and deviance. Finally, it is compatible with the current political culture. Both models of policing “developed as an explicit reaction against the previously hegemonic model of policing - the professional model” - with its “dual emphases: greater aloofness from the citizenry and greater emphasis on technology” (p.447)., In contrast, community policing and broken-windows policing each emphasize informal social control and are “putatively aimed at ensuring that communities police themselves” (p.449). “The critical question then becomes just how the community will be empowered” (p.449). In community policing, the line between the police and the citizen is blurred since they are to be seen as partners. In the same way, the distinction between law abiders and law breakers becomes less clear. In contrast, the lines between police and citizens as well as good and bad citizens are reinforced by the policing paradigm in broken-windows policing. Hence, police become responsible for reducing crime by use of their coercive powers. “The power of the police, then, is not meaningfully threatened by the broken windows approach” (p.450). The “broken windows model endorses the police-centred, aggressive vision of crime reduction that was central to the professional model, and that is potentially challenged by community policing” (p.451)., Broken windows policing is sometimes seen as being responsible for crime reduction in the U.S. This assertion “receives little support when evaluated closely” (p.451), notwithstanding assertions about New York City. Furthermore, there is even question surrounding the purported relationship between crime and disorder (See Highlights Vol.3, No. 3, Item 1)., Part of the popularity of broken windows is that it fits nicely with police culture. Masculinity, morality and the use of force are part of police culture and are central to this theory of policing. Broken windows encourages aggressive patrolling, frequent stops and arrests, and the view that crime is the result of an “external invasion” (p.456). Consequently, these policing practices become justifiable because they are seen as stopping crime. Broken windows policing also fits the dominant political response to crime: tough, quick, and simple., Conclusion. While actively and openly practising broken windows policing, many police departments “profess to be doing some form of ‘community policing’, regardless of whether they are doing anything in practice in terms of improving community relations” (p.459). By conflating the two different concepts, it is argued that “the opportunity for oversight [of police affairs by the citizenry] that community policing presented” (p.459) is diminished., Reference: Herbert, Steve (2001).

"How good are the fancy “geographic profiling systems” such as “Dragnet” at locating the homes of serial offenders? Not bad, actually. In fact, they are just as good as 21 students from Liverpool whose total training in locating offenders consisted of only two sentences of instruction on how to locate the homes of serial offenders.",", Background. Computerized geographic profiling systems are apparently attractive to law enforcement agencies. In an attempt to professionalize their use, it has been suggested that “in order for individuals to be qualified to use [one] to make geographic predictions, they should have three years experience investigating interpersonal crimes and a superior level of investigative skill” (p.110). Computer programs are not magic, of course. Someone has to decide how to use the information about the location of crimes.  There are two correlated hypotheses about the choice of location of criminal activity by those who repeatedly offend:, This study used spatial displays of the locations of 10 sets of serial murders. It pitted Dragnet - a computerized geographic profiling system - against 42 University of Liverpool students. Without training, Dragnet won: it was more accurate, on average, than the average of the students. Subsequently, half of the students were given training.  This instruction consisted simply of telling them the two propositions presented above (e.g., “The majority of offenders commit offences close to home.”). All students were given an opportunity to repeat the task of locating the home of the ten offenders.  [Dragnet was assumed not to need a second try.] With ‘training’, the 21 students did just as well as Dragnet. Obviously, there was some variability across students but with ‘training’, the students’ estimates generally became less variable and more accurate., Conclusion. Giving a set of otherwise untrained under-graduates instruction consisting of only two sentences on how to locate the home of a serial offender made them as accurate as a computerized geographic profiling system. This finding suggests that the sophistication of the knowledge that we currently have in locating the home of an offender is limited. Further, this information is easily communicated to all interested parties who can subsequently use it as effectively as can a “sophisticated” system. The results showed that when the students were far from being accurate in their estimates, the computer system was as well. The implication is that those cases that departed from the simple rules presented in the two propositions were not being discovered by students nor by the geographic profiling system., Reference: Snook, Brent, David Canter, and Craig Bennell (2002).

Proportionality is a simple concept but deciding which factors determine the “seriousness” of an offence will require some difficult choices.,", Background.  In sentencing adults, proportionality is said to be the “fundamental principle” which determines a sentence. In the case of youth being sentenced under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, judges are required to give a sentence that is “proportional to the seriousness of the offence and the youth’s responsibility for the offence.” These statements appear straightforward. It is likely that almost everyone would agree that proportionality should be important in sentencing. However, “[t]here is consensus only in the abstract [about what proportionality means]. The principle is so nebulous that it would be misleading to assert that it provides a meaningful guide to sentencers” (p.143)., This paper examines the arguments that have been put forth for deciding the various factors which should or should not be considered relevant in determining the seriousness of an offence. More important than the particular conclusions of the author are the issues which are raised. Indeed, more than a non-exhaustive list of aggravating factors, the development of some general principles may be most useful., The author begins with a discussion of the work of Von Hirsch and Jareborg. These scholars have suggested that there are two dimensions to proportionality: harm and culpability. The latter principle is the easier of the two. Indeed, familiar criminal law doctrines such as intention, recklessness, negligence and excuses (such as provocation) fit nicely into culpability arguments at sentencing. In determining the former principle, they suggest a “living standard” criterion “where the gravity of criminal harm is determined by the importance that the relevant interests have for a person’s standard of life” (p.147). Von Hirsch and Jareborg focus on the means or capabilities for achieving a certain quality of life, rather than actual life quality. They suggest that there are four living standard levels: subsistence, minimum well-being, adequate well-being and enhanced well-being. Crimes which violate the most basic well-being are most serious since they threaten the ability of a person to live. Further, various interests exist that can be violated: physical integrity, material support and amenity, freedom from humiliation or degrading treatment, and privacy and autonomy. Von Hirsch and Jareborg present various ways in which particular crimes can be “scaled” on these dimensions. “Discounts” can be applied for crimes which create only risks or threats to particular interests. Clearly, one criticism is that the ranking of the various “standard levels” is arbitrarily created in part because it “appears to fit the way one ordinarily judges harms” (p.149)., Another approach proposed by the author of this study is to return to one of the utilitarian justifications for criminal law: “some interests are important and worthy of protection because they are integral to the attainment of happiness” (p.149). Consequently, we would gauge the seriousness of an offence by the degree to which it interfered with happiness. In addition, the argument is made that the law of criminal defences provides some guidance: necessity, duress, provocation, mistake, etc., all give guidance on what we do (and do not) consider to be factors to be taken into account in determining the moral culpability of an action. For example, reckless and negligent offences are typically not as serious as deliberate ones., Conclusion. Clearly, it is important to decide the role that various factors (e.g., intentions, negligence, recklessness) should play in determining the seriousness of an offence. However, these elements could be incorporated into a “reduction in happiness” standard of offence seriousness by noting that intentional, etc., acts typically result in more harm. A useful “proportional” sentencing system will need to develop a coherent structure for the difficult task of assessing offence seriousness., Reference: Bagaric, Mirko (2000).

The Minister of Correctional Services says that “Ontario’s first young offender boot camp [is] a success.” He is wrong.  The Ministry’s own evaluation shows that boot camp “graduates” are not significantly less likely to commit new offences than are youths in standard institutions.,"Background.  Ontario set up a “strict discipline” boot camp approximately four years ago for young offenders aged 16-17 years old.  The “evaluation” of this institution has been released and the Ministry’s press release suggested that the boot camp was responsible for a drop in recidivism from 50% (for a “comparable sample of youth who were not exposed to the program”) to 33%., Differences between groups are typically examined to see if they are “statistically significant.”  If a sample is small, or the difference is not large, what appears to be a “real” difference may be due simply to chance variation. The difference between 50% and 33% may seem large, but it would not be impressive if the 50% figure merely reflected 2 out of 4 youths recidivating and the 33% data simply represented two recidivist youths in a group of six. On the other hand, if the sample size were 300 for each of the two groups, the difference (50% vs. 33%) would be more impressive.  A statistician would say that it was a “statistically significant” difference because the likelihood of getting a difference this large purely by chance is very small (e.g., less than one in a thousand, or p <.001)., This study compared boot camp graduates and a “comparison” group on two sets of dimensions:  psychological changes between the beginning and the end of their custodial experience and recidivism after they were released.  The comparison group was comprised of youths who met the criteria for the boot camp, but did not participate because there was no space at the time.  They differed from the boot camp group on several dimensions, though it is difficult to know whether these differences were important., The recidivism data are easy to summarize.  The “comparison” group (n=60)  was used as a baseline for comparisons with (a) all boot camp participants (n=59 for the highly advertised comparison), and (b) boot camp completers (n=51).  This last group is problematic for the obvious reason:  the “non-completers” are clearly a troubled group.  They have a high rate of recidivism.  Their omission from the boot camp group with no attempt being made to eliminate “failures” from the comparison group is a lethal methodological error for two reasons.  First, the two groups are no longer comparable, since the “worst” kids have been excluded from the boot camp group but not from the other sub-sample.  Second, we are no longer looking at the impact of the institution itself: we are looking only at the impact of the institution on a subset of youths., For almost all recidivism comparisons, no standard statistics are presented in the report.  However, they can be calculated from the data that are available.  The main comparison that is highlighted by the government (p. 47 of the report) shows differences which do not even approach normal statistical significance for the contrast of the comparison group and all boot camp participants.  Furthermore, when one looks at the “boot camp completers” vs. the comparison group, the difference does not approach statistical significance when the appropriate statistical test is carried out (a “corrected” chi-square test).  Even when the somewhat inappropriate “uncorrected” chi-square test is performed on this inappropriate comparison, the difference is not statistically significant.  In other words, using traditional conservative, common-sense statistics, there is no difference between boot-camp participants and a group that the evaluators claim to be comparable.  In any normal social science report, then, the conclusion would be a simple one:  looking at the comparison that the government chose to highlight, there is no reliable impact of the boot camp experience on recidivism., The report is very thorough in its investigation of differences between subsets of boot camp graduates and the comparison group. There are over 30 sets of comparisons drawn between subsets of boot camp and non-boot-camp youths (for various periods of time). In none of these comparisons was a proper “statistically significant difference” found between the groups.  When the report is quoted as saying that “recidivism rates [for boot camp graduates] were consistently lower than the rates observed for a comparable sample of youth…” (p.1 of 24 March 2001 Government of Ontario press release), what is not quoted are statements, also in the report, that point out that the results are not statistically significant.  Even the inappropriate comparison emphasized by the government and described in the report as having “approached conventional levels of statistical significance (p<.10)” (p. 43) can only be stated in this way when conventionally conservative ‘corrections’ (related, in part, to the relatively small sample size) are not included in the calculations., Psychological changes were also examined. The government claims that boot camp graduates “also showed more positive changes in behaviour, self esteem and respect for the law” (p. 1 of press release). The press release omits to report an increase in their scores on a scale measuring the tendency to lie. The “positive results”, too, have to be examined carefully.  Changes in the boot camp participants are examined on approximately 57 dimensions.  They did show changes on about 23 dimensions.  However, these improvements could, of course, be due to such things as re-testing or simple maturation.   That is why God invented comparison groups.  The comparison group data, instead of being in the report itself, are in an appendix.  Nonetheless, the results are summarized by the evaluators: the data suggest that while both groups “made positive gains on the majority of the measures, greater or more significant changes could not be attributed to either group” (p. 29).  So much for the special benefits of the boot camp experience.  Moreover, on tests of “academic competence”, “the pattern of results suggested that greater gains were made by comparison offenders than by [boot camp] offenders” (p.  29) on all but two measures., The report notes that “[s]ome evaluators and researchers would be highly speculative of the findings that we have qualified as non-significant trends.  Based on lack of statistical significance, they might dismiss any positive findings, arguing that without statistical significance there is no evidence to conclude that [the boot camp] has any impact on post-release recidivism.  However, we conclude that the pattern of findings, albeit statistically non-significant, was consistently evident across three examinations of the data (2 interim reports and the current final report)”  (p. 74).  Statistical tests are used for good reason: they help us evaluate whether what we are examining is “real” or likely to be the result of chance variation.  To say that the data are consistent across three reports is meaningless.  Essentially what is being said is that as the data were collected over time, these same data (presumably with some new data added in each subsequent report) showed the same non-significant results.   Finding the same thing three times on the basis of largely the same evidence does not make it more “true” than finding it only once., Conclusion. Using traditional social science standards of evaluation, the findings from Ontario’s boot camp are easy to describe: a very thorough examination of the data found no significant differences on recidivism between boot camp participants (or boot camp completers) and a comparison group. It did not matter whether one looked at recidivism at six months, 12 months, or whatever length of time the youth had been in the community.  There was also no evidence of any overall beneficial psychological or academic impact of the boot camp experience over a standard correctional institution.  The generalized failure of Ontario’s boot camp to show positive effects on youth is consistent with evaluations elsewhere., Reference: T3 Associates Training and Consulting.

"Community notification laws appear to be more effective than they really are.  Even if a community has a law requiring “community notification” of the presence of sex offenders, few, if any, crimes would be prevented.",", Background.  It is attractive to think that “if only we knew who the offenders living in our communities were”, we would be safe.  The problem is that the creation of a registry is one issue, and the effectiveness of that registry in reducing predatory crimes is quite another.   Knowing that there is a person living in the neighbourhood who has committed sex crimes may sound useful, but what one does with this information to avoid victimization is another. Additionally, the implicit underlying theory of these laws is that a centralized database would exist which would help solve sex crimes rapidly.  However, there are costs.  First, fear and concern may be raised that are not offset by comparable crime reduction effects. Second, there are obvious financial costs of notification projects. Finally, concerns exist that the information may be used by communities in ways that decrease the likelihood of offenders being integrated back into society., Massachusetts law requires the state to keep a registry of those convicted of any of 11 sexual or kidnapping crimes. The law also obligates those who have served their sentence to register with local police departments.  Citizens can inquire as to whether any individual is a “sex offender.”  Moreover, depending on the perceived risk of reoffending, the police have an obligation to carry out various levels of community notification., This study is “an optimistic assessment” (p. 145) of the public safety potential of the Massachusetts law.  It assumes that all offenders will comply completely with the law and that the police will carry out all of the required notification. Hence, it explicitly “overestimates the law’s public safety potential” (p. 146).  It looked at a sample of 136 “clinically diagnosed… habitual or compulsive” (p. 146) sex offenders. Again, these subjects provided an “overly generous assessment of the preventive potential” (p. 147) of the law since the study examines what notification would have done for this group of the “worst of the worst.”, Only 36 (27%) of these 136 offenders had a prior registry-eligible crime conviction.  Said differently, 73% of these “habitual or compulsive sex offenders” could not have been in the registry before their current offence. When one looks at the sex offences that they committed (which lead to their imprisonment), only 12 of these 36 committed “predatory-stranger” crimes while the others committed offences against those known to them (e.g., close family friends, close family incest).  A careful examination of these 12 “predatory-stranger crimes” suggests that in only 4 of the 12 would there have been a good chance of notification providing positive effects (and in 2 of the other cases, there was a “poor to moderate” chance). These results are due, in large part, to the fact that the other offences were committed in an area beyond the limits of which the notification would have taken place (e.g., the offender lived in a different jurisdiction from the victim).   However, even in these cases, it would have depended on an aggressive and expensive notification effort on the part of the police.  Furthermore, it would have depended on the victim acting effectively to avoid the crime., Conclusion. A careful examination of the criminal histories of a sample of the worst sex offenders concludes that “the public safety potential of the… registry law to prevent stranger-predatory crimes.. is limited” (p. 154).  In only 4 of 136 cases could the law have stood a good chance of avoiding the victimization and only then if great effort had been expended., Reference: Petrosino, Anthony J. and Carolyn Petrosino.  The Public Safety Potential of Megan’s Law in Massachusetts:  An Assessment from a Sample of Criminal Sexual Psychopaths.  Crime and Delinquency, January 1999, 45 (1), 140-158., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV4N1.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-4-no-1-%E2%80%93-may-2001,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 4, No. 1 – May 2001",Regular Issue,2001
"Does corporal punishment of children lead to antisocial behaviour?  Not necessarily.  It depends on the parents’ level of warmth/control (e.g., support, monitoring, explaining what the child did wrong) and on how high the level of corporal punishment actually is.",", Background: Some researchers have suggested that there is convincing evidence that “children who are subjected to corporal punishment are at risk of delinquent and criminal behaviour” (p. 48).  Whether one likes corporal punishment or believes, as the authors of this paper do, that “parents should strive to use less coercive forms of punishment”, it is noteworthy that surveys suggest that the majority of parents “sometimes” use corporal punishment to discipline their children.  It turns out that the different parenting styles may have different impacts in different cultures.  For example, there is some evidence that for African-American children living in disadvantaged neighbourhoods, corporal punishment is inversely related to delinquency.  The problem is that the studies showing a positive impact of corporal punishment on delinquency have generally failed to take into account other dimensions of parenting. Inept parenting practices, for example, tend to be associated (though not invariably) with higher levels of the use of corporal punishment., This study looks at corporal punishment in the context of other child rearing characteristics: parental warmth, parental monitoring of their children, and parental use of “inductive reasoning” with their children (e.g., explaining what was wrong with their behaviour).  Two-parent families in Iowa and Taiwan were used in this study.  The latter group is important because corporal punishment is used more frequently in that culture. Data were collected from both the children (grade 7) and the parents.  The majority of the data came from the child’s report (use of corporal punishment, self-report delinquency, warmth and control of the child by the parents) although several measures (oppositional/defiant behaviour on the part of the child) were from the parents., The results demonstrate the importance of looking at interrelationships among parenting measures.  For both samples, the more that parents used corporal punishment, the less warm they were and the less they monitored the behaviour of their children. Looking only at the relationship between corporal punishment and conduct problems, generally speaking the more corporal punishment was used, the more conduct problems there were., However, this effect of corporal punishment on delinquent behaviour disappeared for the boys in the Iowa sample when “oppositional-defiant” behaviour and warmth and control by the parents were taken into account.  Interestingly, the effect of corporal punishment was more complex for girls.  For mothers with low warmth and control, increased corporal punishment augmented the amount of delinquency.  For high warmth/control mothers, increased corporal punishment tended to lead to less delinquency.   The Taiwanese data for boys are somewhat different.  First of all, it should be noted that the level of corporal punishment of Taiwanese boys by their fathers is much higher than for Taiwanese girls as well as for either boys or girls in the Iowa sample.  It appears that very high levels of corporal punishment lead to delinquency in children, regardless of parenting styles., Conclusion: Typically, the use of corporal punishment at low to moderate rates is not associated with delinquency once other parenting style variables (e.g., warmth, control) are taken into account.  Hence, one may conclude that in terms of its impact on delinquency, the levels of corporal punishment generally used in our culture are not likely to be a cause of delinquent behaviour. However, very high levels of corporal punishment are associated with delinquent behaviour, regardless of parenting practices., Reference: Simons, Ronald L., Chyi-In Wu, Kuei-Hsiu Lin, Leslie Gordon, and Rand D.

"If “young offender” aged youths understand right from wrong, comprehend that their behaviour is governed by the same rules as everyone else, and are aware of the risks that they take, why do we deal with them under different criminal laws than those governing adults?  One reason is that they are deficient in their ability to make  “mature decisions.” This skill increases throughout adolescence until at least age 18, the age at which youths are typically deemed to be adults.",", Background.  In many jurisdictions, youth justice systems are under pressure to lower age boundaries – both at the lower end (making very young children “criminally responsible”) and at the upper end (legislatively turning adolescents into adults).  In Canada, for example, we will soon be “presumptively” sentencing youths as adults as long as they have committed certain serious offences and are 14 years or older. The research in this area does not support the notion that older adolescents are unaware of the risks that they take or lack logical abilities., This paper examines the developmental changes through adolescence (into adulthood) on antisocial judgements. Using a sample of 810 adolescents in grades 8, 10, and 12 from the same school district, respondents were given tests that measured the following:, The results are easy to describe.  As psychosocial maturity increases, decision-making becomes less antisocial.  Age is related to psychosocial maturity – older youths are more mature than younger ones.  (From other data, it appears likely that psychosocial maturity does not increase significantly after approximately age 19). However, age does not add to the predictability of the degree of anti-social attitudes above and beyond psychosocial maturity. In fact, within each age group, the more mature the youth, the less likely that he or she reported antisocial decisions., Conclusion.  It would appear that throughout adolescence, youths are becoming more mature on such dimensions as the ability to have perspective in what they are doing, control their impulses, and see that they, themselves, are responsible for what happens in their lives.  These are general characteristics and are not tied to specific types of anti-social behaviours.  Hence, policies which treat certain young people as adults (e.g., those charged with certain offences) as well as policies that treat youths as adult for some purposes (e.g., crime) and not others (e.g., drinking) appear to make no sense from a developmental perspective., Reference:  Cauffman, Elizabeth and Laurence Steinberg.  (Im)maturity of Judgement in Adolescence: Why Adolescents may be less Culpable than Adults.

"Ask Canadians sensible questions about sentencing and they give sensible, measured answers.  Canadians do not really expect sentencing judges to keep them safe.  They do, however, want their political leaders and judges to use resources sensibly.  Sensible sentencing appears to be more important to Canadians than “harsh” or “lenient” sentencing.",", Background. Every public opinion poll carried out in the past 35 years that has asked Canadians whether sentences are sufficiently severe has found “discontent” with sentencing: a majority of Canadians always say that sentences in criminal courts are not harsh enough.  The irony of this answer is, of course, that almost nobody knows what the sentences in Canada actually are.  Only recently have we had any systematic information about sentencing patterns in criminal courts.  Part of the problem is that most Canadians think that sentencing can accomplish a great deal: deterrence is seen by most Canadians as being an important purpose of sentencing, notwithstanding the evidence which shows that variation in sentencing practices does not have a significant impact on crime levels., This study looks at an Ontario public attitudes survey in which respondents were asked questions that focused largely on adult and youth crime issues.  For both adults and youth, non-punitive approaches (increasing the availability of social programs, addressing unemployment, increased use of non-prison sanctions) were seen as being better strategies for controlling crime than making sentences harsher.  In fact, in addressing both youth and adult crime, most Canadians would prefer to invest in prevention or non-prison sanctions rather than pay the cost of a harsher sentencing structure (more prisons)., Moreover, when Canadians appear harsh, one of the reasons may be that they have not thought about the consequences of their harshness.  This same survey found that by reminding Canadians that an offender would, if imprisoned, be released after a few months, prison became a less attractive sentence.  Similarly, when Canadians are told the cost of imprisonment, the preferred sanction shifts somewhat away from imprisonment., Harsh sentences (typically involving prison) appear to people, at first blush, to be attractive for a number of reasons.  First, they appear to promise something – incapacitation and punishment, at a minimum.  In contrast, community sanctions (e.g., community service orders) are viewed by many Canadians with much skepticism. Over 60% of Canadians think that half or fewer community service orders for adults or youth are actually carried out., Conclusion.  Canadians appear to want a “response” to wrongdoing by adults and youth.  It need not involve imprisonment. In fact, a focus on the fact that the offender will soon be in the community makes prison less attractive.  However, the sanction must be seen as being carried out.  Therefore, it is not surprising that – at least for minor offences – family group conferences are seen as more sensible responses to offending:  such “accountability” sessions have the elements that are important to the public. Perhaps what is needed, then, are policies that respond to the public, rather than pander to it., Reference: Doob, Anthony N.  Transforming the Punishment Environment: Understanding Public Views of What Should be Accomplished at Sentencing.  Canadian Journal of Criminology, 2000,  42, 323-340., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV4N1.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-4-no-1-%E2%80%93-may-2001,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 4, No. 1 – May 2001",Regular Issue,2001
"Cases that result in a sentence of death in the U.S. are riddled with errors.  A study of 4578 cases from 1973 to 1995 shows that in 68% of them, courts found serious reversible errors.",", Background.  Traditionally, concern about the correctness of verdicts in capital cases has focused on single cases.  This study looks more generally at the process by which a person is sentenced to death and helps to understand, among other things, why it appears to take so long for cases to go from trial to execution.   Two sets of political activities are now happening. On the one hand, moratoriums on executions are being considered or have been declared.  On the other hand, attempts have been made to speed up the process of killing offenders., This study looked at the existing court records of all cases resulting in sentences of death in the U.S. between 1973 and 1995.  Courts at various levels can find errors.  After the trial court imposes sentences of death, a state high court and/or state post-conviction courts can review the case.  Other reviews (federal habeas corpus petitions) are also possible.   This study defined a serious error as something that “substantially undermines the reliability of the guilt finding or death sentence imposed at trial” (p. 5)., The results of this study describe a system that is very prone to error:, Of the 5760 death sentences imposed in 1973-1997, only 5.4% resulted in execution during this period.
The overall error rate (proportion of cases overturned at some stage of the appeals process) was 68%.
The most common cause of errors was “egregiously incompetent defence lawyering” (p. 5). The next most common cause was prosecutorial suppression of evidence. 
Some of these cases went back for retrial during the period of the study.  Of the 301 that were fully retried, 82% (247 cases) resulted in a sentence less than death, and in 7% of the cases (22 cases), the defendant was found not guilty of the capital offence.
The states with high error rates in capital cases are highly dispersed.  Illinois, which declared a moratorium on executions, has an error rate slightly lower than the national average. 
The errors are found at each stage of the (typically) three stage appeals process, suggesting that additional inspections of these cases might lead to additional errors being found. 
The average time between the imposition and the execution of the sentence (for those cases resulting in actual execution) was nine years.  The reason that the number of executions has been increasing in recent years is simply because more people have finally made it through the review process.  It is still the case that tiny proportions of people are being executed, in part because of this high error rate. 
Since the study period ended in 1995, little seems to have changed.  Few executions have taken place and errors still appear to be occurring., Conclusion.  These results provide strong evidence that the court system that imposes death sentences in the U.S. also finds, when given a chance, a substantial number of errors.  These errors are widespread geographically and appear to be due to serious problems that can affect any case (incompetent defence lawyers and inappropriate prosecutorial behaviour)., Reference: Liebman, James, Jeffrey Fagan, and Valerie West.  A Broken System: Error Rates in Capital Cases, 1973-1995.   Columbia University School of Law, 2000., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV4N1.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-4-no-1-%E2%80%93-may-2001,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 4, No. 1 – May 2001",Regular Issue,2001
"Men’s use of alcohol and wife assault are related, but alcohol may not be the cause.  It may be that attitudes about the correctness of male degradation and control of women which are associated with male drinking is the real cause.",", Background.  It is well established that alcohol use is associated with wife assault. Offenders appear to be more likely to be drinking at the time of the assault than one might expect.  Heavy and binge drinkers are more likely to assault their wives than non-drinkers.  Therefore, the question is not whether there is a link, but what the link means.  Various theories have been suggested, including the disinhibition effect of alcohol. Alternatively,  heavy alcohol use may reflect more basic pathologies which are directly important as causes of wife abuse.  Finally, there are a set of explanations that suggest that in certain groups, maleness is associated with heavy drinking and social domination of women., This study examines the link between alcohol and violence against wives using the 1993 Statistics Canada Violence Against Women survey.  Violence was defined by the responses to a series of questions asking women whether their spouses had physically or sexually assaulted them. Alcohol abuse and attitudes and beliefs toward male control and devaluation of female partners were obtained from the respondents., Consistent with previous research, the results showed that the more the male spouse drank, the higher the likelihood his wife had been assaulted in the previous year. Moreover, men who were usually drinking at the time of the assault were more likely to use very serious acts of violence against their wives.  Demographic variables also had an independent impact. The following characteristics of the men were associated with increased violence against their wives:  being less than 45 years old, having less education, being unemployed (long or short term), and living common law or being together for less than 3 years., Male dominance attitudes were measured by such things as the woman’s reporting that he used names and put-downs, that he was jealous and kept her away from other men, and that he limited contacts with others.  These are positively associated with wife assault.  The most interesting finding is that the male’s heavy drinking has no impact on the likelihood of wife assault above and beyond these attitudes., Conclusion: It appears that attitudes that support control and dominance of women are associated with heavy drinking and that it is these attitudes which may be more important than alcohol use in the understanding of wife assault.  If this is correct, “interventions that focus on alcohol treatment [of male batterers] in the belief that addressing alcohol abuse will at the same time reduce violence may be misguided” (p. 70). These programs may be useful, but “the results of this study suggest that unless interventions also aim to address the negative effects of unemployment and [to] alter male attitudes and beliefs in the rightness of male dominance and control over women, they are unlikely to be successful” (pp.70-71)., Reference: Johnson, Holly.  Contrasting Views of the Role of Alcohol in Cases of Wife Assault.

"When is a group of youths a gang?  It turns out that different definitions include somewhat different types of youths.  When very restrictive definitions are used, one is most likely to include those youths with the most antisocial attitudes and behaviours.",", Background.  There is no consensus on what constitutes a youth “gang” or how one defines whether a given youth is a member of a gang.  “Experts” do not appear to agree as to what is the best single definition.  Hence, it is easy to get vastly different estimates of the prevalence of gangs (or changes in the prevalence) simply because there is no consensus regarding what constitutes membership in a gang. Some “gang” researchers suggest that a gang is a group of youths who are seen as a distinct group, recognize themselves as a group (usually with a name), and have been involved in a great enough number of anti-social acts that people see them in a negative way.  The problem is that the first two criteria would fit the Boy and Girl Scouts or university fraternities.  The third might also fit university fraternities. Aside from anything else, that which constitutes “gang” behaviour is also associated with other “memberships” (e.g., class, ethnicity, neighbourhood)., This paper looks at data from questionnaires given to 5935 grade 8 students in 42 schools (315 classrooms) in 11 American cities.  It looks at the relationships of 5 different definitions of gang membership to attitudes and behaviours. Different definitions obviously are important:, Gang members, using any of these definitions, tended to be more likely than non-gang members to be male, racial or ethnic minorities, from single parent homes, and have parents without a high school education.   However, the more restrictive definitions did not result in higher proportions of people who had these characteristics (e.g., the portion of youths in gangs (defined in any of the five ways listed above) who came from single parent homes was roughly the same (40-41%) across all five definitions)., However, demographic variables become relatively less important in predicting gang membership as the definition of gang becomes more restrictive.  Having delinquent peers is important no matter which definition one uses.  In addition, for all definitions, those who indicate that they would not feel guilty if they engaged in certain delinquent activities and those who claim that fighting is an appropriate response in specific situations are also common factors.   Those youths who no longer claim gang status (but once did) are “substantially more pro-social in both attitudes and behaviour than are those persisting in their membership” (p. 124)., Conclusion.  Those youths claiming gang membership are likely to show anti-social attitudes and behaviour but that which constitutes “gang membership” varies according to the definition that one uses.  As one moves to more restrictive definitions, “the theoretical predictors from social learning theory (especially association with delinquent peers, perceptions of guilt, and neutralizations for fighting) supercede the importance of demographic characteristics” (p. 124)., Reference: Esbensen, Finn-Aage, L.

"Do good social programs reduce crime?  Clearly, the answer is yes.  A randomized trial study of the impact of a nurse home visitation program shows that crime can be substantially reduced by providing nursing support to mothers during pregnancy and for the first two years of a child’s life.","Background. It is well known that early experiences in a child’s life affect the likelihood that he/she will be involved in crime.  Thus, factors such as low birth weight (especially when combined with a disadvantaged childhood), harsh parenting styles (or practices of rejection) and association with deviant peers will increase the likelihood of offending in adolescence and adulthood.  The policy question which needs to be addressed is a simple one: how can communities intervene, in positive ways, to decrease the likelihood of later offending?, This paper uses the “gold standard” for attributing causality – the randomized trial experiment – to determine the effects of broad-based intervention in a child’s life – home visits by a nurse before and after the birth of a child – on offending behaviour during adolescence.  Mothers in their first completed pregnancy who were “at risk” (i.e.: young, single and/or of low socio-economic status) participated in the experiment.  These women were assigned to different groups on a randomized basis.  As such, the groups can be considered to be equivalent for all practical purposes.  For some of the mothers (the control groups), the program simply provided assessment and referrals for treatment.   For one “experimental” group, they received this same assessment and referrals, but a nurse also visited them an average of 9 times during pregnancy. The nurse promoted positive health-related behaviours during pregnancy and the early years of the child as well as general help to the mother (e.g., family planning, getting a job, etc.) during these visits.  For the second experimental group, this monthly support visitation program continued until the child was two years old., The results are simple to summarize. The nurse visitation program, especially when the monthly visits continued until the child’s second birthday, reduced the incidence of involvement with the police, arrests, and contact with the child welfare system as a “person in need of supervision” during the child’s early adolescent years (up to age 15) (p. 1242).  “Adolescents born to nurse-visited women who were unmarried and from low-SES families had fewer episodes of running away from home, arrests, convictions and violations of probation than did their counterparts in the comparison group.  They also had fewer sexual partners and engaged in cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption less frequently” (pp. 1241-2)., Conclusion: Social programs designed to promote healthy children can reduce crime.  If a community wants to be tough on crime and simultaneously promote good health in children, it can do so by providing public health services to mothers during their pregnancy and to mothers and children in their first few years of life., Reference: Olds, David, Charles R.

"When the state delegates the administration of punishment to private prison companies, it may, in fact, be unwittingly delegating the allocation of punishment as well.",", Background.  Generally speaking, our society assumes that the state has a central role in the allocation of punishment for wrongdoing.  The traditional notion is that the prison system – public or private – administers the punishment but does not decide how much of it to apply.  This presupposes that incarceration can be categorized “as a simple monolithic process” (p. 81).  When prisons are run by the state, there are still concerns about how prison officials determine the amount of punishment that a prisoner will experience.  However, when the prison is run by a private company, these concerns cannot be ignored.  If the administration of punishment cannot be completely separated from its allocation, “how far should the judicial ‘power to punish’ be privatized?” (p. 80)., This study examined private prisons in Australia and began by noting that prison systems exercise discretion over prisoners (p. 84).  As the author notes, there are “routine, quasi-judicial decisions that affect the legal status and well-being of the inmates” (p.84). For example, prison systems, by their very nature, are often called upon “to use force – perhaps serious or deadly force – against a prisoner” (p. 84).  Further, prisons make recommendations to parole boards, they decide on the use of solitary confinement, and they bring charges against prisoners for institutional infractions.  These clearly involve the allocation of punishment, not merely the administration of it.  The concern is understandable:  what if the private company is, in effect, in a conflict of interest? There are obvious possibilities of pecuniary interests being relevant to decisions about prisoners (for instance, where a prison is paid according to its in-custody count or the situation in which a particular prisoner is expensive to house (e.g., for medical reasons))., In Australia, where disciplinary hearings are held within the (public or private) prison, it is sometimes exceedingly difficult to know whether a conflict of interest exists.  Does a prison official feel that a particular outcome would benefit the prison (private company)?  “There is no such implied suspicion of bias in the operation of a public correctional centre (unless evidence establishes the contrary) because public correctional officers are assumed not to hold a private commercial interest that conflicts with their disciplinary role…. Impartiality is crucial in the process of deliberations… in the corrections system” (p. 86)., Clearly, these concerns must be addressed.  Whether they can be overcome is yet to be seen. Institutional transfer hearings (e.g., where a troublesome inmate is seen as being inappropriate for a particular institution) are an obvious example of conflict.  A private prison manifestly has an interest in ensuring that certain prisoners are given security ratings which would require them to be housed in their institution – or elsewhere.  If higher levels of security imply higher levels of punishment (e.g., fewer privileges, more difficulty getting released) then security decisions (on which institutions have a great impact) become questions of the “allocation” or punishment and not simply its administration., Conclusion: The notion that private prisons simply administer punishment but do not allocate it does not, in practice, fit the facts.  Too many “administrative” decisions, in fact, involve the nature or amount of punishment that a prisoner will experience. As jurisdictions move into the private prison world, these questions will need to be addressed., Reference: Moyle, Paul.  Separating the Allocation of Punishment from its Administration.  British Journal of Criminology, 2001, 41, 77-100., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV4N2.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-4-no-2-%E2%80%93-july-2001,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 4, No. 2 – July 2001",Regular Issue,2001
Provinces in Canada and states in the United States which have the highest degree of economic inequality also have the highest homicide rates.  Much of the divergence in the homicide rates of these two countries appears to be attributable to differences in their levels of economic inequality.,", Background.  A number of different theoretical approaches suggest that “inequitable access to goods provokes antisocial behaviour and violence” (p. 220).  For example, the finding that economic inequality appears to be more important than other variables, including poverty rates, as a predictor of homicide supports this hypothesis.  However, it is difficult to separate poverty and economic inequality in the United States since low average income is associated with high income inequality. In contrast, those provinces in Canada with the lowest average income (the Atlantic provinces) also tend to have the lowest levels of economic inequality. The reason for this difference relates to Canada’s social programs.  Employment insurance substantially reduces financial inequality in the poorest (i.e., Atlantic) provinces while having limited impact in Quebec and little, if any, effect west of Quebec (p. 232).  Furthermore, those provinces with the highest level of economic inequality in Canada have the highest homicide rates. This study typically describes economic inequality in terms of income after tax and after social transfers., Results.  Perhaps the single most important finding is that when household income is statistically controlled for, high levels of economic inequality are associated with high homicide rates.   Further support for the hypothesis that homicide rates are related to economic inequality comes from various analyses (pp. 228-231) which demonstrate the strong, positive association between economic inequality and variation in homicide rates within provinces across time.  Median household income did not produce this same relationship.   Finally, when one looks at the U.S. and Canada simultaneously, it becomes clear that not only do Canadian provinces generally have lower homicide rates, but they also have lower levels of inequality than do American states.  In fact, “[t]he results suggest that [state and provincial level] income inequality may explain a substantial proportion of the large and much-discussed difference between these neighbours’ national homicide rates” (pp. 230-231)., Conclusion. In the U.S., violence appears, at first blush, to be associated with poverty. These data suggest that poverty is not as important as the level of economic inequality in a community in understanding homicide rates.  In Canada, high levels of economic inequality are also associated with relatively higher homicide rates.  Further, as economic inequality rises over time, homicide also increases.  Conversely, when economic inequality drops, homicide rates decline as well. Given that economic inequality is partially under the control of social policies (e.g., employment insurance, social assistance), these results suggest that government social (and economic transfer) policies may be important tools in addressing levels of violence in our society., Reference: Daly, Martin, Margo Wilson, and Shawn Vasdev.  Income Inequality and Homicide Rates in Canada and the United States.  Canadian Journal of Criminology, 2001, 219-236., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV4N2.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-4-no-2-%E2%80%93-july-2001,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 4, No. 2 – July 2001",Regular Issue,2001
Schools can affect the likelihood that students in them commit criminal offences.  This impact is evident above and beyond the effects of the type of children attending the schools.  Well-run schools can reduce crime.,", Background.  It is difficult to examine the effects of schools on crime because youths tend to go to local schools.  Schools in dysfunctional communities may appear to be associated with crime, but this association may have more to do with the neighbourhood or the characteristics of the youths attending the schools than with the school itself.  This paper looks at the effects of different types of schools while attempting to control for neighbourhood and student differences.  In other words, it asks whether the manner in which a school is organized and run affects crime.  Other research has shown that neighbourhoods have impacts on crime above and beyond the characteristics of the students themselves., This synthesis of the literature suggests the following conclusions (controlling for community and student characteristics):, These factors clearly constitute effects of the ways in which a school is run.  Good working conditions, clarity of academic and behavioural requirements, good classroom management, and an administration in which teachers feel their views are heard contributed to lower delinquency rates of the students., Conclusion:  School characteristics have a moderately large impact on crime by students.  Administrative and management practices, clear communication and goal setting, fair procedures for students and teachers, as well as consistent, although not punitive, enforcement of rules contribute to a reduction in student offending.  “The research implies that principals and teachers control behaviour by setting rules, communicating clear expectations for behaviour, consistently enforcing rules, and providing rewards for rule compliance and punishments for rule infractions….  By maximizing student learning and engagement, schools increase commitment to education and attachment to school.  By modeling appropriate behaviour and establishing a fair and just discipline system, school staff enhance student beliefs in the validity of rules and laws” (pp. 90-91).  Put simply, well run schools have impacts far beyond their immediate educational goals., Reference:  Gottfredson, Denise C. “Chapter 3: School Effects” in Schools and Delinquency.

"It is not the experience of being brought up by a sole parent that affects the likelihood of delinquency.  Rather, that which happens after the disruption in the family is crucial: high conflict and being separated from the mother appear to be the most important variables.",", Background. “The topic of broken homes has been a central part of delinquency theory since… the nineteenth century” (p. 22).  Research using both official measures of delinquency and self reports have typically found correlations between broken homes (or disrupted families) and delinquency.  The problem is that both of these terms (broken homes and disrupted families) “include many types of family experience” (p. 22).   In particular, these terms ignore many pre-disruption (e.g., family conflict) and post-disruption (e.g., subsequent family reconstitution) effects., This paper looks at the relationship between “family disruption” and delinquency, but characterizes the family in terms of whether the breakdown followed high levels of family conflict and whether the child, after the family disruption, was still subject to the stabilizing influence of the mother.  The study uses the longitudinal data from the Cambridge study in delinquent development which followed 411 boys born in the mid-1950s for several decades.  Both self-report and official data were examined. Interestingly, the results using these two types of measures were, for the most part, identical., The results replicated previous studies in that delinquency was more prevalent among the boys from disrupted families. Independent of the family structure variable, however, family conflict – defined as “chronic tension or disagreement between parents in many fields” (p. 30) – also predicted delinquency.  Yet, when one looked at conflictual families only, boys from those families which were subsequently “disrupted” were no more likely to be delinquent than boys from conflictual, but intact families.  Similarly, families that were disrupted because of disharmony were more likely to be criminogenic than families disrupted by death.  Further, children who were subsequently with their mothers after separation were also less likely to be delinquent.  Instability (measured by the number of changes in the operative parents) also predicted delinquency., Conclusion. It is clear that “family structure” is important as a predictor of delinquency.  However, being from a disrupted family, per se, does not seem to be as important as the nature of the disruption.  Highly conflictual, “in-tact” families appear to be just as criminogenic as highly conflictual, disrupted families. Thus, the cause of the disruption matters.  Similarly, that which occurs after the disruption also matters. Being separated from the mother, or having instability in the subsequent family structure appears to increase delinquency.  “Single parents” per se do not seem to be responsible for delinquency., Reference: Juby, Heather and David P.

"Why do judges not use draconian measures to deal with apparently dangerous offenders?  Because these measures are in “conflict with fundamental principles and approaches of the common law… in particular proportionality, discretion, and natural justice” (p. 66).",", Background. Many western countries, including Canada, have special, typically draconian, laws to deal with dangerous offenders. These include indefinite sentences, mandatory sentences and special principles of sentencing (e.g., incapacitation) for certain types of offenders.  The question asked by this paper is a simple one: why are relatively few offenders sentenced under these laws?  In Canada, for example, in the first 20 years of such legislation, only about 150 “dangerous offenders” on indefinite preventive detention out of a potential pool of approximately 14,000 prisoners had accumulated in Canada’s penitentiaries.  Hence, the number admitted each year constitute only a tiny proportion of the roughly 4400 prisoners admitted to federal penitentiaries.  “Though highly symbolic of the state’s power to act, and of considerable sociological significance, [laws focusing on dangerous and/or recidivist offenders are] in practice irrelevant, offering little effective protection to the public….  [In addition], throughout their histories, [these laws] were often strongly and continuously opposed by those charged with their implementation – the judiciary” (p. 52)., Judicial responses to these laws have typically been less than enthusiastic. Over the years, judges have found numerous ways of circumventing mandatory penalties.  Few of those who qualify for special legislative provisions receive these penalties.  Australian habitual offender legislation and sex offender provisions, for instance, have been imposed on only a tiny proportion of all those who might qualify (pp. 56-7)., It is probably inappropriate to imply that judges have consciously “resisted” the imposition of these provisions. The judicial actions which result in their non-use “have not been planned or plotted” (p. 59).   “The bedrock of resistance to special laws is the principle of proportionality whose origins have been traced back to the Magna Carta, 1215…” (p. 59).  In addition, “where the judiciary suspects or believes that legislation represents an attack on fundamental human rights, it will strictly construe the language of the statute in order to give it the narrowest interpretation consistent with the intention of the statute and the preservation of those human rights” (p. 61).  Due process requirements and narrow interpretations of the meaning of “prior convictions” have also restricted the use of these laws.  “Judicial discretion… is central to the self-concept of the judiciary…  Courts… have generally been distrustful of unaccountable administrative authority with the result that attempts to restrict the amount of judicial discretion have been strongly resisted” (pp. 62-3).   Finally, at least in Australia, the courts have been “reluctant to make too much of probabilistic data” (p.65). “The liberty of the subject under the common law is not to be set at hazard upon a statistical probability, nor curtailed in the expectation, no matter how well grounded, that an agent of the Executive Government or a Parole Board will choose to set him free before the law’s sentence has run its course” (p. 65)., Conclusion. When special provisions of criminal laws are in conflict with standard criminal law principles, the latter appear to generally win out in jurisdictions with common law traditions.   Notwithstanding this fact, “the danger [of special draconian laws is] an emerging philosophy of despair” whereby these laws “are no longer justified on the basis of the gravity of the offence or even on the basis of the offender’s future conduct, but simply on the basis that the offender has forfeited his or her right to participate in society” (p. 67)., Reference: Freiberg, Arie.  “Guerrillas in our Midst?  Judicial Responses to Governing the Dangerous” in Mark Brown and John Pratt (eds.)

"Criminal justice systems, as organizations, have a way of adapting to changes in the law in a manner that seems to maximize organizational needs.  Consequently, the explicit goals intended by modifications in legislation can be undermined. Changes in sentencing laws will be ignored if their adoption represents serious organizational costs.",", Background.  There have always been concerns that attempts to stifle the use of discretion in one part of the criminal justice system (e.g., sentencing) would lead to its displacement to another decision point (e.g., charging practices).  For example, it has been demonstrated that in several sentencing guideline systems which have forbidden the use of personal characteristics such as race and gender, the criminal justice organization has adapted to these restrictions. More specifically, these same factors are seen to re-appear elsewhere in the system as important determinants of the ultimate outcome.  There are, in fact, three models of how the justice system might react to legal change: (a) a formal legal model which would predict simple compliance; (b) a “substantive rationality model” which suggests that the system would adhere to established norms, and (c) an “organizational efficiency model” which submits that the prime goal is to process cases quickly by way of guilty pleas., The state of Washington introduced sentencing guidelines in 1984 which were based largely on the offence and the offender’s past history. In 1988, sentencing law changed such that first time drug dealers would, for the first time, presumptively go to prison for 12-14 months.  In 1990, presumptive sentences for certain drug offences were dramatically increased.   In 1992, a court determined that offences such as “conspiracy to deliver narcotics” would no longer be treated as a less serious version of the substantive offence, but could be subject to a non-prison sanction., This study looked at sentencing data from 1985 to 1995.  The pattern of results suggested that an “organizational efficiency” model fit the data best.  Pleading guilty clearly led to less severe sentences, partly because “offenders who plead guilty [were] consistently convicted of less serious charges” (p. 1380).  The first set of changes in the law (eliminating the automatic advantage of being a first time offender) had little overall impact, but the subsequent changes dramatically increased the difference in sentence between those who pleaded guilty and those who went to trial. Indeed, going to trial increasingly “cost” the convicted offender in terms of the final sentence.  “The severity of charges at conviction changed significantly following each change in the law, which suggests the manipulation of charges (and subsequent sentences) rather than a strict application of charges to the crimes committed… The overall impact of [the changes in the law] is substantially greater for offenders convicted at trial than for those who pled guilty” (p. 1384)., Conclusion. The hypotheses that either changes in the law will be automatically followed or that punishment will be determined by established norms were contradicted by these findings. Indeed, the “adaptation” to the changes in the law occurred only for those who pleaded guilty.  These results supported the “efficiency” model: “charging practices will change as options for inducing guilty pleas change. Most importantly those changes are entirely contingent upon offenders having pled guilty” (p. 1385)., Reference:  Engen, Rodney L. and Sara Steen.  The Power to Punish: Discretion and Sentencing Reform in the War on Drugs.  American Journal of Sociology, 2000, 105(5), 1357-95., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV4N2.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-4-no-2-%E2%80%93-july-2001,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 4, No. 2 – July 2001",Regular Issue,2001
"The saying “garbage in, garbage out” needs to be applied to meta-analyses conducted in criminology.  This meta-analysis of 35 separate studies shows that an apparent positive effect of family treatment on delinquency completely disappears when one examines only methodologically sound studies.  Generally speaking, the more rigorous the study, the less likely it was to show a positive impact of family treatment on the subsequent recidivism rates of youths.",", Background.  Meta-analyses of research findings have been used in several areas of correctional research to demonstrate the apparently positive impact of certain kinds of correctional interventions.  Essentially, the technique allows the researcher to combine, into one analysis, the findings from a large number of discrete studies in order to determine if a relationship exists between the intervention and some outcome (e.g., recidivism).  If there is a relationship, a meta-analysis allows one to estimate its size., This study is based on the underlying fact that the combination of the results of a large number of methodologically flawed studies (using meta-analyses) simply produces one large meta-analytically flawed result.  It studies the impact on recidivism of interventions involving families in the treatment of young offenders.  Thirty-five studies examining this question were found.  They were graded in terms of their methodological rigor, whereby a point was given for each of four positive attributes of the study (e.g., random assignment, follow-up of at least one year).  The simple results of the meta-analysis could be described in very impressive terms: the studies involved 17,141 young offenders and found a very significant positive treatment effect., The size of the effect of treatment can be scaled such that zero signifies that there is no effect, a negative number means that the treatment increased recidivism and a positive number indicates that the treatment reduced recidivism. The overall treatment effect was 0.15.   More important was the relationship between the apparent effect of the treatment and the methodological rigor of the findings.  Studies that only had 1 of the four criteria of methodological rigor had a “treatment effect” of approximately 0.33 while those that met two of the four criteria had an effect size of about 0.18. For studies with three of the four criteria, the treatment effect was 0.12, and for those attributed all four points, it was approximately zero., Conclusion. The findings were clear: “studies using poorer experimental designs displayed significantly better results than studies using stronger experimental designs” (p. 246).  Thus, although a “standard” meta-analysis would have led one to conclude that family interventions had a meaningful impact on subsequent recidivism for young offenders, this study shows that this apparent effect is likely to be the result of methodological flaws.  The lesson is a simple one:  fancy or sophisticated statistical techniques cannot overcome basic methodological weaknesses.  In other words, “garbage in, garbage out”., Reference: Latimer, Jeff.  A Meta-Analytic Examination of Youth Delinquency, Family Treatment, and Recidivism.  Canadian Journal of Criminology, 2001, 237-253., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV4N2.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-4-no-2-%E2%80%93-july-2001,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 4, No. 2 – July 2001",Regular Issue,2001
The reason that “crime prevention” and “rational” approaches to criminal behaviour have difficulty replacing tough law and order strategies is that these alternatives ignore the “deeper emotional or affective dimensions of crime and its place in society” (p. 265).,"Background.  Tough law-and-order policies are popular in many countries (e.g., the U.S., Canada, U.K. and Australia) independent of whether crime rates are actually going up, down, or staying the same.  “While the policy of fighting crime by increasing imprisonment rates has been described as foolish, misguided, irrational, or uninformed, it has, nonetheless, captured public imagination” (p. 265).   In contrast, crime prevention approaches “are regarded by many as defensive, reactive or irrelevant” (p. 266).   Hence, crime policy and criminology must deal with “the affective as well as the effective, with both instrumental and sentimental aspects of penal policy” (p. 266).  As David Garland has argued, “the essence of punishment is irrational, unthinking emotion fixed by a sense of the sacred and its violation” (quoted at page 268).  To ignore this is to illustrate the conclusion that “academics tend to be emotionally illiterate” (p. 267)., This paper argues that “the urge to punish the criminal is deep-seated and probably universal” (p. 268).  People want order and are antagonistic to those who break it.  Thus, it is not surprising that those who appeal to these emotions are likely to be successful. Indeed, their approaches resonate with public wishes.  As a result, “[t]he discourse is pitched less at the instrumental level than at the symbolic and emotional” (p. 271). It is suggested that people appear to want harsh sentences, for example, for four reasons: security, desert (what is right or proper), the welfare of others, and a desire for change in the hope of creating a better society. Although people can be forgiving of deviance, “they could suffer from compassion fatigue” (p. 271) whereby they are overwhelmed by apparent social problems and “fall back on simpler solutions, on the myths about the effectiveness of severe punishment” (p. 271)., If crime prevention (or other rational approaches) is to be effective, it must go beyond “technical perfection” (p. 272) and “develop philosophies and programs which could compete with law and order at both the symbolic and the practical levels”  (p. 272).  Unfortunately, crime prevention strategies have a tough row to hoe, particularly because they lack “drama and focus” (p. 272).  A necessary condition appears to be that an approach must “stress the ideas of integration, solidarity and cooperation” (p. 273).   Restorative justice models seem to have captured the public imagination in part because they “appeal to the creation of social bonds” (p. 273).  “Their appeal can… best be explained as expressions of social values, sensibility and morality rather than whether these techniques “work” or not in reducing disputes or levels of crime” (p. 273).  In addition, restorative justice approaches may be popular because they remove punishment from the state and return it to the community., Conclusion. “The key to countering the myths of law and order must lie in the ability of programs to help overcome the sense of helplessness and insecurity that crime engenders.  They must overcome the ‘compassion fatigue’, the feeling that ‘it is all too much’, the sense that there are no definitive answers to complex social problems” (p. 274).  “Successful penal reform must take account of the emotions people feel in the face of wrongdoing” (p. 275)., Reference:  Freiberg, Arie.  Affective versus Effective Justice: Instrumentalism and Emotionalism in Criminal Justice.  Punishment and Society, 2000, 3(2), 265-278., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV4N3.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-4-no-3-%E2%80%93-september-2001,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 4, No. 3 – September 2001",Regular Issue,2001
"Habitual offender laws -- those that incarcerate apparently high rate offenders for long periods of time -- may have a small impact on crime, but only because of incapacitation (and not deterrent) effects. In any case, even rather draconian laws, like those in the State of Florida, have “not been very effective in reducing crime” (p. 201).",", Background.  Every U.S. state currently has some form of “habitual offender” laws (e.g., three strikes legislation) that have the effect of incarcerating repeat offenders for longer periods of time than they might ordinarily have served.  There are two underlying theories which provide explanations as to how these laws might reduce crime. The first is general deterrence and the second is incapacitation.  If this legislation were to deter crime in the community, its crime reduction impact would be immediate rather than delayed.  If, on the other hand, it were to have incapacitation effects, the impact would only occur several years later since most of those incarcerated under the special “habitual offender” laws would have received a long sentence anyway.  Hence, if one is looking for positive impacts, one must look far into the future., This study looked at the effect of changes that took place in Florida’s laws in 1988. In particular, it examined the impact of an estimate of the “extra prison time” that an offender received because of the longer sentences imposed as a result of modifications in the law.  These legislative changes were substantial: an increase of approximately 11 years for homicide offences, 12 years for rape, 11 years for robbery, 6.5 years for burglary and 6 years for drug offences., The immediate effects of the changes in the law are easy to describe: “Florida’s habitual offender law does not reduce crime through [general] deterrence” (p. 190).   The impact on reported crime rates of the “extra prison time” which offenders received as a result of the modifications in the law occurred 5-6 years later for some offences. The effects appear to be most stable for robbery, assault, burglary, larceny, and auto theft. There seemed to be no impact on homicide and “the results for rape remain unclear… and subject to debate” (p. 193).  Moreover, the effects are small.  Not surprisingly, the impact is largest (more than half of the overall impact) on the highest volume, but least serious, crime: theft (p. 193)., Some obvious reasons exist as to why the impacts on crime are so small.  Most offenders do not engage in criminal activity with the belief that they will be caught. As a result, deterrent effects of longer sentences are not likely to be large, even if people are aware of the law.  Further, sentencing enhancements generally occur when people are beyond their most active crime years. The justice system is not effective at giving long sentences to those particularly likely to re-offend.  Finally, in the case of certain offences (e.g., trafficking in drugs), other people take over the roles of those who have been incarcerated., Conclusion. One of the ironies of the habitual offender legislation is that the majority of the more serious offenders caught by these laws would have received harsh sentences under any traditional sentencing regime.  Hence, it is not surprising that the new legislation, itself, has little impact.  For the most serious offences, huge increases in prison populations would be necessary to produce any benefits in terms of crime reduction. Further, when one considers that these positive impacts will only appear many years after a law is implemented, it would seem that other long term investments (in families, schools, early development, etc.) would be likely to have at least as much crime reduction impact while also producing other positive effects., Reference: Kovandzic, Tomislav V.  The Impact of Florida’s Habitual Offender Law on Crime.

Permitting police departments to keep all or a portion of the “profits of crime” which they help seize seems acceptable until one discovers that law enforcement agencies have become addicted to these funds.,", Background: Many police departments are allowed to keep a share of the proceeds of crime that are confiscated as a result of criminal prosecutions. The argument for seizing assets rests on the notion that this response “strikes at the economic foundations of the illicit drug trade” (p. 183).  Further, the police often suggest that “forfeiture proceeds can help to assist law enforcement officials by funding continued drug war activities… or [are] a fortuitous source of income that helps compensate for budgetary shortfalls” (p. 172).  These justifications appear neutral until one considers the possibility that police departments could become dependent on such funds. Because of the size and the frequency of these forfeitures, concern has been expressed that “law enforcement agencies come to expect revenue from forfeiture [and, therefore] it is possible that other goals (e.g., service and crime control) are compromised” (p. 172)., In the U.S., “the ‘equitable sharing’ provision of [a federal law] allows federal agencies to divide the proceeds derived from civil forfeitures with all participating agencies” (p. 175).  As a result, state agencies can receive money through this process.  In effect, “what the police take, they will likely get to keep for their departments under federal law” (p. 175)., This study reports the results of a survey of 770 law enforcement agencies in the U.S. conducted in 1998.  Potentially the most important single finding was that 26% of large law enforcement agencies “strongly agreed” and an additional 20% “agreed” with the statement that “[c]ivil forfeiture is necessary as a budgetary supplement” (p. 178).  In other words, 46% of these agencies admitted to being dependent on civil forfeitures.  Small law enforcement agencies -- those with fewer than 100 sworn officers -- were less dependent.  “Only” 31% indicated that they had become addicted to civil forfeitures.   It would seem that for larger police forces, receipts from civil forfeitures are more predictable. Consequently, they can afford to depend on the availability of these funds.  In fact, an additional analysis suggested that the more money a police department reported receiving as a result of civil forfeitures, the more dependent they admitted to being on them.  Hence, regular access to the addictive substance (the proceeds of crime) led to increased reports of addiction., Conclusion: “The most important finding… is that many law enforcement agencies are [now] dependent on civil asset forfeiture…. Nearly 40% of the large agencies… reported that forfeiture is necessary as a budgetary supplement” (p. 182).  Hence, some have argued that “law enforcement has a vested interest in there being a drug problem because of the money and resources that stand to be gained” (p. 183).  Numerous forfeiture reform proposals have been  “continually beaten down by the law enforcement lobby…. The struggle may have occurred because of law enforcement’s apparent dependence on civil asset forfeiture” (p. 183)., Reference: Worrall, John L.

"Boys are much more likely to be “life-course persistent” offenders than girls, but only slightly more apt to be “adolescent-limited” offenders.  However, the predictors of male and female “life-course persistent” offenders are very similar. In the same way, the factors predicting whether boys and girls will become “adolescent-limited” offenders are also alike.",", Background.  “Life-course persistent antisocial behaviour originates early in life when the difficult behaviour of a high risk young child is exacerbated by a high-risk social environment” (pp. 355-6).  As these children get older, the domain of factors that can be “risks” expands beyond the family to include a large part of their social world.  In contrast, most adolescent-limited youths have had a healthy childhood and, for the most part, outgrow their delinquent activities., This study initially identified, from a longitudinal study of New Zealand children, those who had extreme, and stable, anti-social behaviour problems from ages 5-11.  Subsequently, it identified a group of youths who were offending in mid-adolescence, but who were not problematic children.  There were about 10 times as many “life-course persistent” boys as girls.  For the adolescent-limited youths, there were only 1.5 boys for every girl., Nevertheless, the “risk predictors” from childhood for the boys and girls who were identified as having “life-course persistent” behaviour problems were more or less the same.  The “adolescent-limited” girls and boys had many fewer “risk” factors than the life-course persistent adolescents but, once again, the boys and girls looked very much alike.  “The childhood background of delinquents in the life-course persistent path is pathological, but the background of delinquents on the adolescent-limited path is normative” (p. 367)., It is important to remember that there are many more “adolescent-limited” male and female anti-social behaviour problems than “life-course persistent” adolescents.  Moreover, even though their backgrounds were very different, their behaviour in mid-adolescence looked very similar.  Hence, therapeutic interventions based solely on adolescent-behaviour are more likely than not to be focused on children without problems. Furthermore, although the distributions of types of behavioural problems of male and female adolescents do differ, the findings for females are “broadly consistent” (p. 368) with those reported in studies that focused largely or exclusively on boys., Conclusion. It is clearly important to differentiate between “life-course persistent” and “adolescent-limited” forms of anti-social behaviour in adolescence.  It would appear that the most efficient approach to “life-course persistent” behavioural problems for both boys and girls would be to focus on ways of minimizing risk occurring early in life.  In contrast, interventions for adolescent-limited anti-social youths might be more effective if carried out during adolescence. Further, these therapeutic strategies should acknowledge the broadly non-pathological backgrounds of these youths while also making efforts not to “incur social costs” (p. 370) such as those resulting from harsh treatment in the criminal system., Reference: Moffitt, Terrie E. and Avshalom Caspi.  Childhood Predictors Differentiate Life-Course Persistent and Adolescent-Limited Anti-Social Pathways among Males and Females.

"If one considers minor types of violence (e.g., kicking or threatening) to be equivalent to more serious forms (e.g., beating, choking or using/threatening to use a gun or a knife), the rate of victimizations by male and female spouses are approximately equal.  However, women in spousal relationships are much more likely to be victims 
of serious violence than are men.",", Background. There are a number of studies that have reported that “women use violent tactics against their spouses as frequently as men” (p. 28).  For example, the recent British crime survey found that women were only slightly more likely than men to report being assaulted or receiving frightening threats from a spouse in the previous year (5.9% vs. 4.9%).  Data such as these have been used to suggest that a fearful symmetry of violence exists in spousal relationships., This study reports results from the 1999 Statistics Canada General Social Survey module on spousal violence.  A man or a woman in a household (but not both) answered the questions about victimization.  For the first time in Canada, the same questions about spousal abuse were asked of both sexes., The results are easy to describe: Women are slightly less likely to report being victims of any form of violence from a current spouse in the past five years than are men (but no difference was found for the previous year).  Women are considerably more likely to report being the victim of violent acts at the hand of a previous spouse (both in the past year and during the last five years)., More important is the finding that “the types of violence inflicted by marital partners [are] quite different… Women were more likely to be subjected to threats of violence, pushing, grabbing or shoving, being beaten or choked, having a gun or knife used against them, or sexually assaulted.  Higher percentages of men were slapped or kicked, bit or hit… Women are almost four times more likely than men to [be the victim of] the most serious and potentially injurious category of assaults….” (pp. 34-35).   Furthermore, women are much more likely than men to be a victim of emotional abuse (e.g., name-calling and put-downs, threats to harm someone else, limits on contacts with family or friends, damage or destruction of property)., Conclusion. “Women were more likely than men to experience frequent and serious types of assaults and, as a result, were more likely to suffer physical injury, to use medical services, to spend time in hospital…. to say that they feared for their lives…. [and to suffer] negative emotional outcomes” (p. 40).   Not surprisingly, rates from “previous” (as opposed to current) spouses were much higher.  Therefore, when one hears that rates of spousal violence are the same for men and women, one needs to remember that this is true only if one is willing to accept that being slapped is the same as being choked, stabbed or beaten., Reference: Johnson, Holly and Valerie Pottie Bunge.

"Does providing offenders with a job on their release from prison reduce recidivism?  It does, but only for those who are relatively mature (at least 27 years old).  Arranging employment for younger offenders seems to do little.",", Background. It is often assumed that getting a job is a crucial life event which marks the transition from adolescence to adulthood and accounts for the cessation of offending. The only problem with this hypothesis is that the data do not support it. On the contrary, “[m]ost experimental efforts to reduce crime through employment have had null or disappointingly small treatment effects” (p. 530).  These findings would seem to suggest that it is not work alone, but work in combination with some other variable(s), that is important., This study re-examines the data from a large experimental program in the U.S. to which 3000 people were referred by criminal justice, social service or job-training agencies. These individuals were randomly assigned to experimental or control conditions.   Those in the experimental (treatment) condition were offered minimum wage jobs (in construction or service industries). The participants in the experiment had been incarcerated in the previous 6 months, had participated in a drug treatment program, or, in the case of a youth, often had an official delinquency or criminal record.  The experiment was run in nine cities. About ¾ of the participants had at least one previous property offence., The results are simple: Six months after assignment to the guaranteed job (or to the control group in which no employment was offered) differences began to emerge between the treatment group and the control group but only for those who were age 27 or older.   Further, the “older” individuals in the treatment group were less likely than those in the control group to have been arrested from the six-month point onwards. Three years after the initial assignment, approximately 47% of the (age 27+) control group had not been arrested. In contrast, approximately 58% of the (age 27+) treatment group had gone without any arrests.  The results were similar for “illegal earnings”.  Almost immediately after assignment to treatment or control, differences existed on whether or not the men reported illegal earnings.  Those individuals in the treatment group who were aged 27+ were less likely to report illegal earnings than similar aged people who had been assigned to the control group., Conclusion.  “Work appears to be a turning point in the life course of criminal offenders over 26 years old. [Older] offenders [age 27+] who are provided even marginal employment opportunities are less likely to reoffend than those not provided such opportunities” (p. 542). The impact of these programs is age related. In other words, no effects were found for those aged 26 and younger.  Because these findings came from a true (random assignment) experiment, it is unlikely that the employment effect is caused by other factors.  The findings suggest that “the conditions that stop crime in adulthood are not simply the reverse of those that caused it in adolescence… Whereas parents, peers and neighbourhoods are inarguably among the initial causes of crime… work and family factors take precedence in explaining [the cessation of offending]” (p. 543)., Reference: Uggen, Christopher.  Work as a Turning Point in the Life Course of Criminals: A Duration Model of Age, Employment, and Recidivism.  American Journal of Sociology, 2000, 67, 529-547., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV4N3.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-4-no-3-%E2%80%93-september-2001,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 4, No. 3 – September 2001",Regular Issue,2001
"Electronic monitoring of offenders is not all that it is cracked up to be.  It is not ordered as much as is typically predicted; it seems to create technical breaches, and it does not appear to produce the promised cost savings.",", Background. Despite the lack of convincing evidence of its efficacy, electronic monitoring (first introduced in the U.S.) has become popular in a number of places. It was initially used in Britain in 1989 as a condition of bail.  Early enthusiasm turned sour when it was imposed less frequently than predicted and resulted in regular breaches of very stringent bail conditions.  Sweden and the Netherlands have used electronic tagging more as an alternative to prison (e.g., whereby offenders given short prison sentences can apply for it or those in prison can be granted early release contingent on their consent to be electronically monitored) (p. 20)., This study of the Scottish experience with electronic monitoring suggests that, like other places that have implemented it, more enthusiasm exists in principle than in practice for the procedure.  In three locations, very few (fewer than 3%) of all possible cases received it.  Part of the reason for this low rate of use is that there were many technical breaches associated with the procedure.  Of 152 orders, “only 11 offenders… completed their orders with no unauthorized absences at all” (p. 208).  Reasons for breaches were typically that the offender was not at the right place at the right time, domestic disputes occurred which resulted in the offender leaving the home without authorization, or there was damage to the equipment.  Long orders were less likely to be completed successfully and the use of electronic monitoring on young repeat offenders was particularly unsuccessful., Costs, in Scotland, could not be assessed with accuracy because commercial confidentiality agreements made it impossible to know the true cost of monitoring by private sector companies. “The requirement of commercial confidentiality [could] mean that the costs of commercially provided community sentences could never be made available to public scrutiny in the same way as is now routinely done for sentences delivered by non-profit making agencies” (p. 209).  One unanticipated “cost” was in relation to the families of those being monitored. Relatives often felt pressure and anxiety related to their role in monitoring their family member.  The question of how much responsibility should be devolved to families remains open., Conclusion. Despite the inability to obtain accurate cost estimates, it appears that, due to the large number of technical breaches, little reason exists to expect more than “at best modest net savings through a reduced use of custody” (p. 210).  “There seems [to be] no reason to believe that tagging as a sentence, or part of one, will have any greater effect on offending rates, in the short or longer terms, than any other penalty” (p. 211). This should not be surprising since electronic monitoring does nothing to change the offender.  Generally speaking, it would appear that the experience in Scotland with this new surveillance technology should make one question whether electronic monitoring is really capable of having any significant impact on crime or the criminal justice system., Reference: Smith, David.  Electronic Monitoring of Offenders: The Scottish Experience.

Sometimes simple programs can reduce crime.  Improved street lighting decreased criminal offending in a public housing project in England.,", Background. Various approaches have been used to reduce crime.  One of the most direct ways of achieving this goal is to make the immediate environment less conducive to criminal activity.  Much ordinary crime is opportunistic. In other words, the crime incident takes place because the conditions were somehow right for it.  Had the conditions been less amenable, those committing the offence would not necessarily seek out other places where it would be easier to commit a crime.  Studies suggest that “situational crime prevention” efforts do not simply displace criminal activity into locations more conducive to crime., This study examined the impact of improved street lighting.  Comparing an “experimental” area, in which lighting was improved, and a “control” area in which it was not, results from a victimization survey showed that crime was reduced overall by 23% in the “improved lighting” location, but by only 3% in the control location.  The control and experimental areas originally had equally poor street lighting.  The improved lighting was focused on the main roads.  Another effect of the improved street lighting was that “the number of people (especially women) on the street after dark increased in the experimental area, but not the control area” (p. 270)., A survey of youths aged 12-17 was also carried out.  In face-to-face interviews conducted in a manner in which the youths would feel safe to admit offending, these individuals were asked whether they had committed each of approximately 30 antisocial acts.  The amount of violence that these youths admitted to engaging in at night decreased significantly more in the area in which the lighting had been improved than in the control area.  There was also some indication that youths were less likely, under the experimental condition, to be stopped or “told off” by the police.   The adolescents in the improved-lighting location also showed a greater reduction in their levels of fear of being victimized than did the youths living in the control location., Conclusion. It is clear that relatively minor physical changes in a neighbourhood -- in this case improved street lighting -- can change the level of offending that takes place.  Unlike many “situational crime prevention” strategies (e.g., bigger and better locks or security systems), this change is not based on the ability of the resident to pay for improvements. Furthermore, other non-crime benefits existed in this case. More specifically, people apparently felt safer on the streets and were more willing to use them in the evenings., Reference: Painter, Kate A. and David P.

"The justice system is judged largely on whether it is perceived as being fair in the manner in which it uses its authority.  Drawing from a number of different surveys, it appears that procedural fairness is more important than specific outcomes.","Background. “People often assume that the outcomes received when dealing with specific police officers and judges shape reactions to those encounters. In contrast… research consistently suggests that people actually react to their personal experiences primarily by judging the procedures used by the authorities” (p. 215).   The manner in which people are treated, as well as whether they feel that decisions are made fairly appear to be of crucial importance.  “People are willing to accept the decisions of police officers, judges, mediators, and other third party authorities when they think that those authorities are acting in ways they view as fair” (p. 216).   Hence, the public’s views of criminal justice institutions are linked more to perceived justice than to specific outcomes or utilitarian concerns., This study suggests that confidence in the police and the courts is related less to judgments about cost, delay, and performance than it is to perceptions of procedural justice.  The findings are drawn from a number of different sources and can be summarized as follows:, Conclusion. In four different studies, it was found that the quality of the treatment which people receive, or perceive in the community, is the most important factor in determining people’s views of criminal justice institutions.  Although specific outcomes are important, they are not as decisive as procedural fairness. These findings were confirmed for both white and minority groups. Results such as these serve as a reminder that it is not just what the criminal justice institutions do that is important but how they are perceived as doing it., Reference: Tyler, Tom R.

"Banning cigarettes in prisons may be a good health practice. However, non-smoking policies may have unforeseen negative effects as cigarettes move from the “largely benign gray markets… into more problematic black markets, where [they] are a highly priced commodity” (p.142).",", Background. Many jails and prisons currently prohibit inmates from smoking.  Until bans were imposed, cigarettes were traditionally used “as a standard form of currency in informal prison economies” (p.144). This practice is explained by the fact that they are relatively small, durable, and are not considered serious contraband unless held in large quantities.  When cigarette smoking was merely controlled, various methods were developed to conceal possession and use of tobacco., This study examined the impact of bans in 16 correctional institutions in the U.S.. Researchers conducted formal, as well as informal discussions with prisoners and staff.  When tobacco products were banned completely in prisons, one of the consequences was a dramatic increase in the cost of cigarettes. In fact, the value of a carton of cigarettes in correctional facilities ranged from approximately $200 to $500. Various techniques were used to smuggle tobacco into the institution. These strategies involved some risk of apprehension and, in some cases, payoffs to correctional officers.  Since most correctional officers did not see cigarettes as immoral or dangerous, it was not surprising that a portion of them were involved (either directly or indirectly) in the smuggling of cigarettes into prisons. For instance, packs of cigarettes were purchased from correctional officers in one institution for $20 (at least five times the street value) and the individual cigarettes were subsequently sold to inmates for $5 each.  Various practices – some benign, some dangerous – developed to avoid detection.  For example, ingenious methods of hiding cigarettes in toilets were found (p. 150) as well as lighting cigarettes without matches (using pencil lead and toilet paper to start a fire with the electricity from an ordinary electrical outlet, p.157).  For clever inmates, cigarettes clearly provided opportunities. As one maximum security inmate serving a 90-year sentence for drug trafficking lamented, “I would’ve never messed with coke on the street if I knew how much money I could’ve made selling cigarettes here in the joint” (pp. 158-9)., Conclusion. Although discouraging smoking may be good health policy, most inmates interviewed continued to smoke in the institution. Unfortunately, the financial costs of maintaining this habit were considerable and several individuals believed that robbery within the prison had increased as a result of the ban.  Moreover, health risks may have increased in some situations (e.g., various inappropriate papers – for instance, pages from a Bible that contained ink that is, itself, harmful when burned - were being used as well as the consumption of higher tar tobacco).  Further, the ban resulted in increased tensions between staff and inmates.  Finally, criminal justice consequences clearly exist for the small portion of inmates who are apprehended and who, as a consequence, are likely to spend more time in custody., Reference: Lankenau, Stephen E.

"Canadian youth court judges are influenced more by the previous disposition that a young person received than by his/her past criminal behaviour.  Youths tend to be handed down either the same type of sentence that they received the previous time or a more severe sanction, independent of the present crime that they committed.  In other words, it is not just what you did, or who you are, it is what the judge did the previous time that makes the difference.",", Background.  Typically it is thought that legal variables – the current offence and the youth’s history of offending – are the most important factors in determining the sentence.  However, research also suggests that “the severity of earlier sanctions is an important factor affecting current disposition – specifically the decision to impose a prison sentence” (p. 170)., This study examines the effects of previous youth court dispositions on sentences handed down in Canadian youth courts in 1993-4.  Attempts were made to control for the seriousness of the current and most recent prior charges of conviction, as well as age and gender.  Data on both the most recent prior disposition and the second most recent prior disposition were examined., The results show that the most recent prior disposition and the second most recent disposition were important in determining the sentence handed down.  For example, if a youth received secure custody on his/her most recent as well as the second most recent dispositions, his/her probability of being given secure custody for the “current” offence was .65.  On the other hand, if the most recent disposition was secure custody, but the second most recent disposition was probation, the probability of being handed down secure custody at this time was only .45. Clearly, remote dispositions appear to have an influence on the current sanction., Not surprisingly, the most recent disposition also has an influence. For instance, this article examined the sentences given to youths whose second most recent previous disposition was open custody. For these youths, the probability of being handed down secure custody for the current offence after having received secure custody as the most recent previous disposition was .48. In contrast, the probability of being given secure custody for the current offence if the most recent previous disposition was open custody was .28.  Further, in those cases where the most recent previous disposition was probation, the probability of receiving secure custody dropped to only .13.  Statistical analyses demonstrated that these effects were independent of the current offence., Generally speaking, there is evidence for stability and escalation.  “Consistency over the second prior [disposition], first prior [disposition] and the current disposition is more likely than switching between dispositions… Where there is a change from one disposition to another, it is more likely to be escalation than de-escalation” (p. 195) for those cases involving probation, as well as open and secure custody., Conclusion. The disposition handed down to a young person in Canada’s youth court is “strongly influenced by prior dispositions, rather than being entirely guided by the nature of the current offence” (p. 195).  “Prior dispositions are ‘sticky’ labels which tend to last indefinitely” (p.195).  “The nature of the most recent prior offence and the age and gender of the offender had only a weak association with the current disposition when relevant case characteristics were controlled…. The finding that the effect of a prior offence is mediated by the disposition awarded for that offence has the intriguing implication that it is the dispositional history rather than the history of offending that is salient in later dispositions… Thus a criminal history is a history of judicial reactions to past behaviour, rather than the behaviour itself” (p. 196).   “For young offenders with prior records, it will be difficult for [them] to receive less severe court responses that match any possible reduction in the seriousness of the reoffending” (p. 197)., Reference: Matarazzo, Anthony, Peter J.

"Two-person police patrols are no better than one-person patrols in catching burglars in the act.  Burglars are most likely to be caught if the police are called at the beginning of the burglary, not when the burglar is on his/her way out of the building.  For these burglaries, speed of response – not the number of police in the speeding car – makes a difference.",", Background. Solving crimes after the offender has left the scene and without a witness who can identify the assailant is very difficult.  Therefore, it has been suggested that the police not only need to arrive quickly at the scene of a crime but they also need to have sufficient force to apprehend the offender.  Although two-person patrols have been promoted for various reasons (e.g., officer safety and the ability to apprehend offenders more effectively), research suggests that increased patrol strength is not particularly effective in deterring crime or making arrests.  Moreover, “studies indicate that single-officer patrols tended to be safer… and [officers] are no more likely to be injured, irrespective of type of shift or police precinct…” (p. 382)., This study was carried out in the U.K. and examined a sample of 441 burglaries which were drawn from the 9% of burglaries that were reported in 1996 while “in progress” (p. 383).  [Clearly, having two police officers attend a burglary in which the offence took place hours or days earlier would not be expected to have any impact.], The findings suggest that there are two main determinants of whether a burglar is caught at the scene of the crime: the moment at which the police are called, and the length of time that it takes them to arrive.  When the police were called as the burglar was entering the dwelling, 19% were caught. In comparison, there was an 11% apprehension rate when the police were contacted after the burglar was already inside the building, and a 2% success rate when the burglar had already left the premises. If the police arrived at the scene within 4 minutes of being called, arrests were made in 15% of the cases. Conversely, the success rate dropped to approximately 8% after 6 minutes., The fact that two-officer patrols tended to reach the scene of the offence more quickly than single-officer units could easily make it appear that the former strategy was more effective.  However, when various characteristics of the two-person patrols were controlled for, the presence of two police officers in the car did not seem to make a significant difference.  More specifically, two-officer patrols appeared to do better because they had certain advantages (e.g., they tended to be driving faster cars or were more likely to respond to incidents in which the burglar had been spotted earlier).  Overall, the findings are simple to describe: “Chances of capture were significantly better when the burglar was spotted entering or inside the building rather than leaving, when someone other than the victim reported the incident, and when the police reached the scene quickly.  When these factors are taken into account, patrol unit staffing is of little or no importance” (p. 393)., Conclusion. Catching offenders “red handed” is obviously advantageous for everyone.  The one factor largely under police control which affects apprehension rates is the speed at which the police arrive at the scene.  Hence, an increase in single-officer patrols would likely be more effective than two-person patrols.  However, these results need to be understood in the context of the finding that most burglaries are reported too late for this to be of any real importance., Reference: Blake, L., and R. T. Coupe.  The Impact of Single and Two-Officer Patrols on Catching Burglars in the Act.

Maternal employment has no direct impact on the delinquency of children in the family. Children of working mothers are no more likely to be involved in delinquent behaviour than are children whose mothers are not in the work force.,", Background. One of the largest structural changes in American society in the past 50 years has been the increase in female labour force participation.  While only 16% of all American children had working mothers in the 1950s, the number rose to almost 70% in the 1990s. Although there are numerous claims that maternal employment “causes” delinquency, few data exist to support this notion. Part of the explanation for the lack of effect of maternal employment on juvenile crime may be that it is “most beneficial for children when the alternative is poverty…” (p. 21)., This study looked at a group of 707 adolescents between the ages of 12 and 14 years.  The subjects of this sample tended to be born to mothers who were younger, less well educated, and more likely to be members of minority groups than the population at large. As such, they may constitute a “high-risk” group.  Self-report delinquency measures were obtained on these youths.  Data were collected on the mother’s employment at the time that the child was 12-14, as well as when he/she was 6-8 years old., The findings are straightforward.  Mothers’ employment (either when the child was 6-8 years old or when the child was 12-14 years old) had no impact delinquency when the child was 12-14 years old.  However, low family income when the child was an adolescent was related to delinquency. Delinquency was associated with reports by the child that his or her mother did not know whom he was with, the presence of delinquent friends, and dissatisfaction with one’s school experience.  The only indication that maternal employment may have some small and indirect impact on delinquent behaviour was the fact that maternal employment was one of the predictors of the child’s report of whether his or her mother knew whom he was with. However, maternal employment was not found to be directly associated with delinquent behaviour.  Put simply, children whose mothers were employed (either when they were 6-8 years old or in early adolescence) were no more likely to be delinquent teenagers than were children whose mothers were at home., Conclusion. “The widespread concern over the fates of working women and their children is largely unsupported” (p. 252).  The study’s results are consistent with other research on delinquency: supervision, association with peers, and attachment to school - factors that are directly related to the youth’s own experiences – predict early adolescent delinquency.  “If improving family life is a goal of crime control policy, it would make good sense to aim at addressing the structural factors that limit maternal and family resources and that contribute to community disorder. [This] study suggests that policy debates should avoid ideological attacks on working mothers, which portray them as leaving their children “home alone” and concentrate instead on the economic and educational inequalities that weaken families and neighbourhoods” (p. 154).  Mothers in the work force are not a cause of crime., Reference: Vander Ven, Thomas M., Francis T.

"Violence in schools in the U.S. has not increased in frequency or seriousness in the past quarter century.  Although the youths have not become more violent, the schools have become more punitive whereby suspensions and expulsions have doubled. Hence, it is the school’s response to the youth and not the behaviour of the young people that may have the greatest negative impact.",", Background. Homicides by youths in the U.S. (and in Canada) are not increasing.  At the same time, most Americans and Canadians believe that they are, in fact, on the rise.  This is not surprising.  For example, a study of local TV coverage in California found that 70% of news stories about violence involved youths. In contrast, only 14% of the arrests for violence involved young people. These results were corroborated by other research which showed that half of the stories (of any kind) that concerned children or youth involved violence., The data on youth and the schools’ response to violence suggest that school policies are responding to beliefs rather than facts about school violence.  Between 1976 and 1998, there was no change in the number of youths who reported, in large scale surveys, having been victimized on any of the following dimensions: being the victim of theft or vandalism, being injured with a weapon, being threatened with a weapon, being injured without a weapon or being threatened without a weapon.  “Despite remarkably stable rates of student victimization over the past 23 years, suspensions and expulsions have increased… from 3.7% of students in 1974… to 6.8% of students in 1998 (3.2 million students suspended)” (p. 3).  Given that the school is one of the few institutions in which positive interventions into the lives of young people can occur with little difficulty (i.e., without the obstacles inherent in mediation involving the family or peers), these large percentages translate into lost opportunities for positive intervention by the educational system., “Code of conduct” policies such as those of the Province of Ontario require suspensions for such behaviour as uttering a threat, possessing illegal drugs, or providing alcohol to minors (e.g., a 19 year old giving a can of beer to an 18 year old).  Hence, despite the fact that Canadian data also do not suggest an increase in youth violence, our policies appear to be based on a similar demonization of young people., Conclusion. The “mass exclusion of … children from the educational process” (p.4) has been criticized on various grounds, including the fact that it appears to increase the likelihood of troublesome behaviour by these youths, as well as augment the chances that young people will drop out of school. In the U.S., suspensions are strongly associated with race: “African Americans are approximately 2.6 times as likely to be suspended from schools as whites” (p. 4).  Hence, consideration of these outcomes requires one to remember that the data neither support the view that school violence is increasing nor that schools are a particularly dangerous place for youths.  In fact, the data suggest that schools are a safe place to be when compared with the places in which youths spend the other 80% of their waking hours., Reference: Schiraldi, Vincent and Jason Ziedenberg.  Schools and Suspensions: Self-reported Crime and the Growing Use of Suspensions.  Justice Policy Institute Policy Brief. 1 September 2001.

Homicide rates across 36 nations are related to private firearm availability.  It is not the case that high homicide rates lead to high levels of firearm availability.,", Background.  In comparison with most industrialized nations, the rate of lethal violence in the U.S. is considerably higher, even though the rates of other criminal offences are generally similar.  Gun homicide rates, in particular, are much higher in the U.S. than in other countries. One explanation is that the rate of “gun possession in the U.S., particularly handgun possession, exceeds that of every other country for which data are available” (p.570). Research has found that, across 21 countries, a substantial relationship exists between the rate of homicides - particularly of women - with a gun and the rate of handgun ownership (See Killias: Canadian Journal of Criminology, October 2001).  Alternatively, some have suggested that firearm ownership, particularly handgun ownership, is a consequence of high rates of lethal violence, rather than a cause of it., This study examined the relationship between gun ownership and homicide rates in 36 nations in an attempt to determine the direction of the relationship (high gun possession leading to vs. resulting from high homicide rates).  Because rates of gun possession are only available from surveys carried out in 21 countries, a proxy measure – gun suicide rates – was used as an indicator of firearm availability.  It turns out that the correlation between the percentage of suicides involving a gun and the survey data on firearm possession is very high – a correlation coefficient of +0.90 (where a correlation of 1.0 would mean a “perfect” relationship).  The proportion of suicides involving firearms varies considerably from less than 1% (South Korea) to 61% in the U.S.. Various control variables were included in the analysis: population density, proportion of the population that are young males, ethnic heterogeneity, the generosity of the welfare system, and income disparity., The analysis involved a statistical technique designed to help determine the direction of the relationship.  Controlling for other variables, results show that the homicide rate does not predict firearm availability. Conversely, firearm availability does predict homicide rate, once control variables are entered into the equation., Conclusion. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that “greater gun availability increases the likelihood that a gun will be used in an attack, which in turn increases the risk that the victim will die of his or her injuries” (p. 587). Hence, the “contention that widespread gun ownership deters homicide is not supported in the present analysis” (p. 588). “Results do not support the hypothesis that high levels of lethal violence cause people to purchase firearms in order to protect themselves. Homicide rates had no effect on the measure of firearm availability” (p. 588)., Reference: Hoskin, Anthony W.  Armed Americans: The Impact of Firearm Availability on National Homicide Rates. Justice Quarterly, 2001, 18, 569-592., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV4N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-4-no-4-%E2%80%93-december-2001,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 4, No. 4 – December 2001",Regular Issue,2001
"Despite the purposeful design of a Toronto “domestic violence” court to allow the prosecution of cases in a manner that does not rely solely on the victim’s testimony, the likelihood of a prosecution going forward is considerably higher if the victim cooperates. Even in those cases in which the victim’s collaboration is not supposed to matter, it does.",", Background. With the popularity of mandatory arrest policies for domestic violence, one might have expected high levels of prosecution of these cases.  However, studies in some jurisdictions suggest that as few as 10% of these cases are being prosecuted.  The lack of cooperation of the victim appears to be a major impediment. Victim cooperation, itself, is likely to be partially a result of a justice system that ignores the reality of the situation of women (91% of the victims in this study were women) who have been victimized.  Existing research suggests that “one of the major obstacles to cooperating is intimidation by the accused or fear of reprisal if they cooperate” (p. 599).  Other factors include lack of responsiveness of the criminal justice system to the victim’s needs and a desire on the woman’s part to continue or repair the relationship, as well as women’s acceptance of violence from their partners., This study looked at the 474 cases brought to a specialized Toronto court in 1997-1998. This court was established to improve the response of the criminal justice system to domestic violence. According to the Ontario Crown Policy Manual, charges were not to be withdrawn in these cases except in exceptional circumstances.  The police were to gather evidence “so that the prosecution need not rely solely on victims’ testimony” (p. 603).  Statements of the victims were to be videotaped and a victim/witness assistance program made attempts to contact all victims in this court.  This program was designed to keep clients aware of the court proceedings and make the victims comfortable with the legal process in various ways., The results showed that when the victim cooperated, the chances of the prosecution taking place were dramatically higher than when the victim did not.  Hence, even in a situation in which the court and prosecution service were structured to minimize the importance of victim cooperation, their collaboration was, by far, the most important variable determining whether the case was prosecuted.  Not surprisingly, victims who had already been videotaped and who had met with the victim/witness assistance personnel were more likely to cooperate.  In other words, early cooperation predicted subsequent cooperation which, in turn, predicted prosecution., Conclusion. From interviews with victims, it appears that support given by the victim/witness program may be important in encouraging cooperation.  If successful prosecution is one of the goals of the criminal justice system, ways of creating cooperative victims need to be examined. These programs appear to be promising in this regard.  At the same time, the interview data highlighted the importance of the police as well.  Hence “to be effective, policies that seek to improve the criminal justice response to domestic violence must be informed by the victims’ experience throughout the process.  Such an approach will help us to address more effectively the issue of victim cooperation” (pp. 619-620) which will, in turn, lead to more successful prosecutions., Reference: Dawson, Myrna, and Ronit Dinovitzer.  Victim Cooperation and the Prosecution of Domestic Violence in a Specialized Court.

"Although the findings from comparisons between public and private prisons may not be clear, the questions that should be asked have been identified. Moreover, what is clearly apparent is that the issues surrounding the privatization of prisons are much more complex than simply a question of whether profits should be derived from the incarceration of offenders.","Background. Though most commentators would agree that the allocation of punishment (e.g., sentencing) is a “core” state function, there is less agreement about whether its administration should be.  However, this distinction between the allocation and the administration of punishment becomes blurred when one asks whether decisions on how and where a prison sentence should be served can be delegated to a private company.  The experiences in Australia and elsewhere with regard to the privatization of prisons suggests the following (p. 110):, Conclusion: Privatization raises a host of issues about prisons that are largely relevant for jurisdictions with only public prisons as well. The way in which prisons are run and monitored is made salient with the movement toward privatization but the mechanisms that are put in place to monitor private prisons are typically relevant for public sector prisons too. Hence, what is necessary is to put the individual findings concerning the privatization of prisons in a cross-national context so as to better understand the impacts of these changes., Reference:  Coventry, Garry.

"The privatization of prison requires open accountability which may be seen as being in conflict with private commercial contracts. In jurisdictions in which the move to privatization is driven largely by ideology rather than economics, it may be the government that is most interested in keeping details of the privatization from the public.",", Background: The Australian state of Victoria has the most privatized prison system in the world.  Privatization did not occur because of direct concerns about costs or prison over-crowding, but rather because of government ideology that favoured privatization. Hence, unlike a contractor whose sole interest is in value-for-money, the Victorian government had an ideological interest in demonstrating that privatizing prisons was effective., Given that the state of Victoria had an interest in proving its ideological decisions to be fiscally and socially effective, it is not surprising that the government tried to keep details of the contract and the performance of its private prisons from public scrutiny.  This was the case of one private prison, although the government and the private company were unsuccessful in concealing these facts., The issues involved in the legal action aimed at opening these contracts to public scrutiny were consistent with the current view that governments (and those who act in their name) must be held accountable.  The problem, of course, is that “accountable” means that standards have to be set. In this Australian case, the standards tended to be inappropriate, inadequate, overly quantitative (and, as such, missing important qualitative dimensions) and overly narrow (pp.123-4).  “Costs” were clearly one criterion, and it is possible that the government was concerned because costs appeared to have increased with privatization.  The difficulty is that the data on “benefits” and “performance” were less available than the costs., Part of the problem is that in order to achieve accountability, there is a need for public sector monitoring of performance.  It turned out – perhaps for ideological reasons –, that “levels of accountability [for prisons] diminished” with privatization.  Without doubt, some of the difficulty occurred when questions of problems with the private prisons arose. In these cases, it was the Commissioner of Corrections (who had let the contracts) who had the responsibility of monitoring whether the private sector company (which he had chosen) was doing a good job.  The state’s Auditor General saw this as a conflict of interest (p. 129), and, in fact, the Director of Monitoring had developed a “close relationship” with the private providers of services.   The more basic problem is simple to state, but difficult to solve: “So long as government retains the responsibility for a service, it remains accountable… The nature and extent of these non-delegable accountabilities is the subject of… debate” (p. 131)., Conclusion: When privatization is ideologically, rather than economically, driven, it is not surprising that it is governments which are anxious to hide details of contracts and performance. If privatization is to take place, the challenge is to “take the responsibility for monitoring, supervising and reporting on the private sector activities out of the hands of the public sector correctional authorities [who are responsible for the privatization decision] and place it with a truly independent authority” (p. 132).  In this way, both public and private sectors could be required to meet set standards.  “Failures of accountability will ultimately bring the process [of privatization] and the governments who champion it, into disrepute” (p. 132)., Reference: Freiberg, Arie.

The responses of women to the experience of incarceration may be “as much or more a product of the nature of women’s corrections at a particular time and place as they are a product of the nature of women themselves” (p. 713).,", Background.  The manner in which people respond to imprisonment has been seen as a function of the prison itself (focusing on either the broad coercive nature of the institution or the characteristics of the particular facility) or of the characteristics of the inmates.  Most research has suggested that “women’s responses to prison differed from men’s” (p. 682)., This study diverges from previous research by examining the experience of imprisonment of women in two different Californian female facilities instead of using men’s prisons as a comparison.  The first prison - the California Institution for Women (CIW) - was opened in 1952 and was built and run on a “rehabilitative” model.  Physically, it is described as an example of the “campus model of prison architecture” (p. 687).   Even now, this institution (built for 800 inmates but currently holding approximately 1700-1800) appears to have maintained the culture of the “old penology”, emphasizing individual responsibility, diagnosis and treatment.  The second institution - Valley State Prison (VSP) - opened in 1995 for a planned population of 2500 but presently holds about 3600 women. It can be seen as a prison representing the “new penology” – “concerned with the identification, classification, and management of dangerous groups” (p. 685)., Interviews with a random sample of 70 women suggested that the manner in which women “did time” depended, to some extent, on their pre-prison characteristics and experiences – social class, age and their history of abuse. Race had no effect. More interestingly, the type of institution made a difference.  “Women in VSP were much more likely than women at CIW to avoid friendship altogether” (p. 703).  Women in the prison run on the principles of the new penology (VSP) were less likely to receive help from other inmates and were much more likely to describe guards in negative terms. It would be easy to suggest that doing time at CIW, compared to VSP, was doing “easy time”.  However, that is an oversimplification in that “regardless of their personal characteristics or where they were imprisoned, [virtually all the women interviewed] voiced similar concerns about their families and their lives after prison.  Absence from children and family was uniformly defined as the hardest part of doing time and virtually all of the women expressed fears about what they would do upon release and whether they would be able to turn their lives around” (p. 711).  However, the nature of the institution was critical in a more subtle way.  In the “old-penology” women’s prison (CIW), “variations in women’s pre-prison characteristics are reflected in greater variation in their adaptations” (p. 710) than in the “new penology” prison (VSP).  “What women bring to prison appears to have less influence on how they experience incarceration at VSP” (p. 710). “At VSP, the newer institution designed for efficient management and control…, these individual variations were blunted and women’s ways of doing time showed more homogeneity” (p. 711).  Instead, women were more suspicious, detached, etc., than they were in CIW., Conclusion: It would appear that the ways in which incarcerated women respond to their imprisonment may have to do more with the nature of the institution than with the gender of the inmates. “The ability to ‘do your own time' is shaped by particular dispositions of power and practices of control” (p. 713)., Reference:  Kruttschnitt, Candace, Rosemary Gartner, and Amy Miller.  Doing Her Own Time?

"Any assessment of police efficiency or effectiveness on the basis of  “clearance” rates deserves careful scrutiny.  If police are evaluated in terms of the number or types of offences which are recorded, one should remember that these numbers are, in fact, produced partly by the organization which is responsible for them.",", Background:  When Canadian homicide laws changed in the mid-1970s, overall homicide rates drifted downwards.  However, the number of first degree murder charges increased.  One inference which could be drawn from this pattern is that our murders were becoming more serious.  However, the most likely explanation is that police, over time, changed their criteria for defining an event as a first degree murder rather than a second degree murder., This paper examines the manner in which British police statistics about crime (equivalent to our UCR data) are created. Additionally, it points out that, as those who evaluate the police pay more attention to these numbers as “performance measures”, it is almost inevitable that these statistics will decrease in their usefulness for this purpose.  In Britain, the achievement of “crime reduction targets” is seen as a measure of police performance.  The first difficulty with this approach is that, for the most part, the police are not responsible for the level of crime in a community and cannot effectively control “actual” levels of crime. As one police researcher pointed out, “one of the best kept secrets of modern life” is that “the police do not prevent crime” (p. 219)., Nevertheless, in Britain, a drop in police recorded crime has often been described as the result of more effective policing.  In periods of time when only “clearance rates” were important, crimes known to the police were often not recorded (pp. 224-5).  When it was valuable to record crime (e.g., when increased resources were seen as flowing from high crime rates), crime recording increased.  In some instances, efforts spent in getting inmates to agree to admit to particular offences (in circumstances in which they would not receive any additional punishment) accounted for 40% of all cleared offences (p.227)., The main difficulty with evaluating police forces by their ability to reduce crime is that such practices obviously encourage non-recording of crime, especially if individual detachments have similar goals imposed upon them.  The organization responsible for overseeing police forces in Britain has recently found evidence of significant (e.g., 15%-17% in various forces) under-recording of crimes reported to the police (pp. 230-1). This has been done, in part, by deciding that the crime did not, in fact, occur (“un-founding” the offence).  Conversely, a “performance culture” can also lead to distortions in the opposite direction for an individual police officer. One of the ways in which this is done is to charge offenders with more serious offences (e.g., possession with intent to traffic rather than simple possession). This practice increases not only the “offending rate” but also the “clearance” rate for more serious offences.  In addition, as one 1999 report from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of the Constabulary found, there was evidence in one force that detectives were not allowed to earnestly investigate a serious sexual assault. This was due to the fact that, “whether they solved a rape or the theft of a car radio, the division would only be credited with one detection” (p. 234) and a serious sexual assault investigation would require significantly more police time and resources. In another instance, a system was created to avoid official recording of  “difficult to detect” crimes (p. 235)., Conclusion:  Like many other performance measures, crime figures can easily be manipulated by police forces in order to present themselves favourably.  “Any judgement of police efficiency made on the basis of crime clearance continues to be problematical” (p. 235).  The “performance measure” approach to evaluation may consequently have reduced the usefulness of the measures themselves., Reference: Loveday, Barry.  Managing Crime: Police Use of Crime Data as an Indicator of Effectiveness.  International Journal of Sociology of Law, 2000, 28, 215-237., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV3N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-3-no-6-%E2%80%93-february-200,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 3, No. 6 – February 200",Regular Issue,2001
"California has a higher rate of people in prison for drug offences than Canada does for all offences combined.  No criminal justice benefits appear to be reaped from this high incarceration rate.  In the 2000 election, Californians voted to reduce drug imprisonment.",", Background. In California, the “War on Drugs” was operationalized as a “War on Small Drug Users”.   The result was that California had a drug imprisonment rate of about 132 per 100,000 of the population in 1999 - approximately 2.5 times the U.S. national average.  Because of the widespread use of drugs in the “normal” population, the “supply” of potential targets of a drug war can be considered to be virtually infinite.  Drug policy and the enthusiasm with which it is enforced appear to be the determinants of the number of cases processed by the criminal justice system., California policy appears to have used “drug possession” charges as one way of ensuring that their prisons were kept at or above capacity levels.  In 1980, for example, 379 people were sent to prison for drug offences.  By 1999, the number had increased to 12,749.  The policy appears to have been based on a belief in the deterrent impact of imprisonment and the idea that locking up people for drugs would incapacitate those involved in drug use and drug sales.  Low level and first time drug offenders were especially targeted, “increasing the personal costs of drug use among incipient users” (p. 2). In 1980, most (about 65%) of drug imprisonments were for drug trafficking, possession for the purpose of trafficking, or manufacturing.  By the late 1990s, more than half of the drug imprisonments were for simple possession of small quantities of drugs., The impact on crime of these policies can be estimated by looking at the variation across counties within the state.  The enthusiasm with which these policies were enforced varied. The data are simple to describe: there is no evidence of a beneficial impact of harsh drug enforcement policies on crime. “The absence of differential effects between counties with strict drug enforcement policies and counties with more lenient drug enforcement policies does not support the deterrent and incapacitation arguments of drug enforcement advocates” (p. 6).   However, there were some suggestions of negative impacts of harsh policies in that “[c]ounties that made fewer drug arrests, and concentrated their enforcement efforts on felony manufacture or sale rather than simple-drug possession offences were significantly more likely to experience declines in violent crime….  Counties that rarely imprisoned low-level drug offences showed the largest reduction in violent and property crime” (pp. 10-11).  Minor drug arrests appear to have “no relationship to, and no impact on, either crime or drug abuse” (p. 14)., Conclusion: In 2000, Californians voted by a 61%-39% margin to require drug treatment instead of jail for those arrested for drug possession or use.  It would appear that they have learned that they are not getting “value for money” from the billions of dollars being spent to imprison small drug users.  California voters were not alone in demanding reform of harsh drug laws: there were drug policy issues on ballots in seven states in the recent election and in five of them, harsh drug laws were voted out., Reference: Justice Policy Institute.  Drug Use and Justice: An Examination of California Drug Policy Enforcement.  [Online].

"Watching local television news increases viewers’ fear of crime, particularly for people who live in high crime areas or who have been victims of crime.",", Background. What makes people think that they are likely to be victims of crime?  Very few people have enough “direct” experience with crime to allow reasonable inferences about their likelihood of being victimized.  It has been suggested that for those most vulnerable – and most fearful –, media influences are “overshadowed by direct personal and interpersonal experience with the reality of crime” (p. 758).  Others have suggested that TV representations of crime resonate only with, and therefore only affect, those whose lives are congruent with those images. This would suggest that only those who live in high crime areas or who have been victimized would be influenced by television images of crime. Finally, one could expect that only those who believe that TV images reflect reality would be affected by them., This study examined fear of crime as measured by responses of Florida residents to questions concerning the likelihood that they would be victimized in six different ways. They were also asked about their television news (local and national) viewing as well as various demographic questions.  “Actual crime” was assessed by using official crime rates for the city or county in which the respondent lived., Several of the control variables – amount of actual crime, age, sex, and being Hispanic – impacted on the person’s perceived likelihood of victimization.  The amount of local television news which a person watched had an impact above and beyond these other variables. More interesting is the fact that the effect of TV news viewing seemed to be largest in certain groups.  Those who lived in high crime areas, those who had been personally victimized or had a family member who had been a victim of crime, and those who believed that local news reflects the reality of crime were more likely to show “effects” of viewing local TV news. In other words, members of these groups who watched a lot of local television news were more likely to be fearful of being victimized than were members of these groups who watched little local TV news.  Those whose beliefs or lives did not resonate with the image of local crime stories (those who lived in relatively safe areas, who had not experienced victimization, or who didn’t believe in the “accuracy” of local TV news) were relatively uninfluenced by the amount of local TV news which they watched., Conclusion: “Reality and TV are not competing explanations for people’s perceptions about crime…” (p. 780). Instead, they are “factors that interact in the social construction of fear and possibly other meanings about crime” (p. 780). The effects of local TV news on fear of being victimized overwhelmed any effect of viewing national news.  “Local news effects are most often significant for viewers who live in high-crime areas, have recent victim experience, or who perceive news accounts as realistic” (p. 780)., Reference: Chiricos, Ted, Kathy Padgett, and Marc Gertz.  Fear, TV News, and the Reality of Crime.  Criminology, 2000, 38, 755-785., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV3N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-3-no-6-%E2%80%93-february-200,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 3, No. 6 – February 200",Regular Issue,2001
"Religious attitudes, like those of criminal justice, are complex.  People who are “religious” may be seen as showing support for rehabilitation as well as for punitiveness.  The issue comes down to what we mean by “religious attitudes.”",", Background:  Religion has never been very far from criminal justice attitudes.  On the one hand, the new U.S. president identifies himself closely with organized religion and has brought this into the White House by focusing on religious groups as recipients of federal social service money. This same individual was also responsible for more executions than any other American governor in recent history.  On the other hand, Canadians can claim the father of the youth who was killed in the 1999 school shooting in Taber, Alberta. An Anglican minister, he has been speaking out for forgiveness and understanding while also suggesting that the “lesson” from Taber is to comprehend why the shooting took place and to address those causes rather than focus on punishing the boy who killed his son., This study examines religious attitudes in detail.  Data from previous studies differentiate what are typically referred to as “fundamentalist” religious views (e.g., those accepting a literal interpretation of the Bible) and those that are non-fundamentalist.  Fundamentalist Protestants, for example, are more favourable toward capital punishment than other religious groups.  In this survey of Ohio residents, people were asked a number of detailed questions about their support for punishment (e.g., “Punishing criminals is the only way to stop them from engaging in more crimes in the future”) and rehabilitation (e.g., “It is important to try to rehabilitate juveniles who have committed crimes and are now in the correctional system”). They were also asked about religious forgiveness (e.g., “God teaches that even if someone has lived a life of crime, they should be forgiven for their offences if they are truly sorry”) and Bible literalness (“I believe the miracles described in the Bible actually happened just as the Bible said”), as well as their beliefs in a punitive God and the salience of religion in their lives., The results show that religious views had effects above and beyond demographic variables (age, sex, race, income, political affiliation, victimization and fear).  Religious “forgiveness” predicted lower support for capital punishment, less support for punishment and more support for rehabilitation (generally, and as the main goal of prisons). On the other hand, “Bible literalism” predicted less support for rehabilitation., Conclusion: Being “religious” is not useful as a way of understanding a person’s criminal justice attitudes.  Rather, it appears that the “type” of religion is important: those who support religious forgiveness support rehabilitative goals of imprisonment and are less in favour of simple punitiveness.  Belief in the literal interpretation of the Bible appears to describe those least in favour of rehabilitation in prison.  With respect to criminal justice attitudes, it is clearly not useful to talk in simple terms about those who are “religious” or not., Reference: Applegate, Brandon K., Francis T.

The warriors against drugs should look at the historical record of trying to suppress opium use. Attempts at suppressing drugs have had the paradoxical effect of increasing supplies and markets.,", Background.  Over the past 150 years, it appears that opium markets have expanded to meet the supply that is available.  The end of the free trade in drugs, brought about in the first part of the 20th century, seems to have resulted in a growth in both production and consumption since that time.  For much of the 19th century, drug sales (e.g., British sales of Indian opium to China) were an important part of international trade revenues.  Attempts to monopolize this trade led to the opening up of new sources of drugs (e.g., Turkey). European entrepreneurial activity not only created new sources, but also new markets (e.g., in Southeast Asia)., Attempts to restrict the use of drugs after World War I shifted the emphasis to heroin. This was due, in part, to the fact that heroin was more compact, easier to ship, and highly addictive. World War II apparently also had an enormous impact on drug use (and trade). Largely because of global restrictions on shipping drugs, both supplies and markets were almost completely suppressed.  However, with the end of global warfare, incomplete attempts to eradicate drug trafficking had paradoxical impacts.  For example, the relatively successful eradication of the supply of Turkish opium, “stimulated both opium production and heroin consumption…  The illicit world price rose, stimulating opium production elsewhere…. From this predictable, but unrecognized market logic, every short-term victory, every successful eradication or crop substitution, would become a market stimulus that brought another defeat for America’s drug wars” (p. 205).  “With global demand constant, a sudden supply reduction in one sector simply raised illicit prices and stimulated increased cultivation elsewhere across the vastness of the Asian opium zone.  In essence, the four US drug wars of the past quarter century extended a local law enforcement model into the international arena… that would contribute to an increase in world opium supply….” (p. 206).  Undoubtedly, part of the problem is that in many “less controlled” countries, drug production has enormous advantages over conventional crops – “credit access, storability, increasing value over time, permanent marketability, and easy transportability” (p. 211).  Thus, the problem is that because suppression is typically bilateral and ephemeral – e.g., the U.S. temporarily suppressing supply from one country –, a rise in drug use typically occurs when supplies increase and costs decline.  Though there have been times when perfect coercion has proven effective (e.g., during World War II), “imperfect coercion unleashes a whirlwind of unpredictable consequences” (p. 215)., Conclusion. “Over the past century, each attempt at drug prohibition has produced an unexpected market reaction that has allowed the illicit traffic to adapt, survive, and even expand.  After a century of such unintended consequences, it may be time to learn from the past and develop strategies for minimizing the negative impact of both bilateral and multilateral drug control efforts” (p. 218)., Reference: McCoy, Alfred W.  Coercion and its Unintended Consequences: A Study of Heroin Trafficking in Southeast and South West Asia.  Crime, Law, and Social Change, 2000, 33, 191-224., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV3N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-3-no-6-%E2%80%93-february-200,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 3, No. 6 – February 200",Regular Issue,2001
Can crime be reduced effectively by identifying offenders likely to re-offend and incarcerating them? The answer is simple: No.,"Background.  The “new penology” represents a shift from the treatment of offenders to “the efficient management of dangerous groups. The [penal] task is managerial, not transformative” (p.704). The terms “protection of society” or “protection of the public” now appear to mean “making it impossible for people to offend by placing them in prison.”  This is one of the justifications used for “three strikes” legislation. There are, however, serious problems with incapacitation models of sentencing, including the following:, But the most serious problem is that even the most careful (and optimistic) selective incapacitation model (Greenwood and Abrahamse’s 1982 Rand Corporation report) shows high rates of false positives (around 50%).  Furthermore, in the construction of its sentencing model, the Greenwood and Abrahamse study used “items that are unrelated to either the offence or the blameworthiness of the offender” (such as employment history, juvenile and adult drug use, and juvenile criminal history, p.719-720)., The study described in this article replicated the Greenwood (Rand) study.  The results of this “new and improved” study are simple to summarize: Using California prison data, only 36% of those who were predicted to be high rate offenders actually turn out to be high rate offenders.  Moreover, about one third of the high rate offenders were not identified as such., Conclusion.  “Proposals for selective incapacitation are predicated on the idea that we can prospectively identify high-rate offenders sufficiently early in their careers to reap the incapacitative benefit of crime reduction. The major obstacle to the successful implementation of such proposals is that no convincing evidence exists that this is possible” (p. 726).  There is a “tremendous appeal of selective incapacitation as an idea.  Given that we have every reason to believe that a small subset of criminal offenders contribute disproportionately to the total volume of crime in a society, a strategy that promises to locate and incapacitate this group is almost irresistible in its elegance. The seductive simplicity of selective incapacitation leads otherwise conscientious researchers to conclude that it works, despite the total lack of evidence to support such a conclusion.... The obstacle to realizing this seemingly perfect solution to crime prevention lies in the prospective identification of this offender pool.  We simply cannot do it with any reliable accuracy” (p. 727). [The criminologist Frank Zimring once remarked, “The wonderful thing about incapacitation as a method of crime control is that it has no moving parts.”]   As another writer noted, “the criminal justice system has been burdened with unrealistic expectations of solving social problems that have [proven to be] insoluble elsewhere” (p. 728)., Reference.

"A study of inmate riots and disturbances in over 300 adult maximum and medium security (U.S.) state prisons suggests that “collective violence is a product of unstable, divided, or otherwise weak management” in prisons.",", Background.  There have been two popular explanations for collective disorders (riots, disturbances, and protests) in prison:, Inmate balance theory suggests that riots, etc., take place “when prison officials take abrupt action to reassert control.  In contrast, administrative-control theory posits that inmate collective action is the product of ineffective authority.”  Much of the research that has been carried out consists of case studies or enquiries into prison disturbances., This study collected data from wardens or superintendents of 317 prisons.  Wardens were asked whether their institution had experienced a riot, disturbance or non-violent protest. Administrative control was assessed through such things as how well the prison administration and the front line officers worked together. Wardens were also asked whether there were “prohibited groups” operating in the prisons. This was used as a measure of the breakdown of administrative control. In addition, they were asked whether any policy crackdowns (e.g., on inmate movement, work assignments, etc.) had occurred.  These were measures related to  “inmate balance theory.”, The findings tend to support “administrative-control” theory, though not all of the indicators of administrative control predicted inmate disturbances. However, “if administrative sanctions are used ineffectively and prohibited groups are allowed to proliferate, the likelihood of a serious collective act by inmates significantly increases” (p. 752)., Conclusion. “Prisons that achieve a high level of esprit de corps among officers, that successfully combat the development of prohibited inmate groups (e.g., street gangs and racial hatred groups), and that maintain a high level of officer competence and a low level of agitation between officers and inmates are less likely to experience unlawful, collective inmate protests than similar prisons that do not meet these managerial challenges”  (p. 753)., Reference. Useem, Bert and Michael D.

"Black residents of both the U.S. and Canada are more likely than white residents to perceive that the criminal justice system is biased on racial grounds.  In Canada, contact with the police or the courts increases the perception of bias for black residents.",", Background.  It has been suggested that social class has become more important than race in determining perceptions of criminal justice agencies.  Some have suggested, for example, that it is class, not race, that determines the targets of “police misconduct” and the perception that the system is biased.  These two studies suggest otherwise., These studies, one carried out in Canada, the other in the U.S., both look at the role of race (and educational achievement) on respondents’ views of discrimination by the police.   The American study examined opinions regarding the role of the police in providing security in neighbourhoods, confidence that the police treat people of both races equally, unfair treatment by the police, and the perception of how widespread the problem of racism against blacks is among police officers., The Canadian study looked at the perception that certain groups are treated worse (e.g., the poor, the young, blacks) by the police and the courts.  Generally speaking, Canadian respondents perceive more discrimination by the police than by criminal court judges.  In addition, “black respondents are much more likely to perceive police and judicial discrimination than either Chinese or white respondents” (p. 446-7).  Canadian blacks “are more likely than their white and Chinese counterparts to report that discrimination is both severe and commonplace” (p.448).   The American data are similar: controlling for education, income, age, gender, region of the country, and  political orientation, “Blacks are significantly more likely than whites to view themselves as being the brunt of harsh treatment at the hands of the criminal justice system.... and to believe that racism among police officers is very or fairly common” (p. 500)., Education does make a difference.  In the US, the more educated a respondent is, the more likely it is that there will be negative appraisals of the criminal justice system’s treatment of blacks generally.  Similarly, in Canada, those who were best educated were most likely to perceive the criminal justice system as being unjust., The most dramatic finding for Canada, however, was that contact with the police or the courts was likely to increase perceptions of criminal injustice, particularly for blacks.  This may not be too surprising given that blacks were much more likely to report that they had been stopped by the police (43% of males reported being stopped at least once in the past two years) than were whites (25%) or Chinese (19%).  Hence the problem is not that blacks hold an uninformed stereotype of the police and courts based on no direct experience.  When they actually have contact with the criminal justice system, their views become even more negative., Conclusion. These findings -- that blacks are much more likely than whites to perceive racial bias on the part of the police and courts -- are important for a number of reasons including the fact that “people obey the law [in part] because they believe that it is proper to do so... People are more responsive to normative judgements and appeals than is typically recognized by criminal legal authorities...” (p. 461).  Given that most people believe that it is the responsibility of the police and others in  the criminal justice system to maintain confidence in the system,  these perceptions of injustice cannot be ignored.  They are also important because they are one more indicator of differential treatment of blacks by the police and other parts of the justice system., References.

Victims want to be recognized as participants in the criminal justice process. Police can improve victim satisfaction and support for themselves by keeping victims apprised of developments in “their” case.,", Background.  In the Netherlands, as in many other countries, crime is seen as a key social problem.  As in many other countries, most members of the public in that country think that sentences are too lenient.  Policy responses are predictable: “get tough” practices have been implemented.  “Both the number and the length of custodial sentences have increased dramatically in recent years” (p. 168). Inmate populations have increased dramatically., The major concern of victims, however, is “a lack of interest by police and their failure to inform the victim of the developments in their case” (p. 169)., This study reports on interviews with 640 victims of property crimes or minor assaults.  Although most victims (80%) wanted to be kept informed about their cases, only 33% of those who wanted the information actually obtained it., The results of the study are simple:  Those who were kept informed about the progress of their case were more satisfied with the performance of the police, showed more support for the police, and indicated that they were more in agreement with sentencing practices of judges.  This last finding “may be a result of the improved satisfaction and support for the authorities.  However, it may also be the result of the fact that notification provides victims with accurate information about sentencing” (p.176). As the authors point out, “notification has advantages for criminal justice authorities and policy-makers. It provides authorities with a simple means to enhance victim satisfaction and support without changing the [structure of the] existing criminal justice system” (p. 176)., Conclusion. One humane way of treating victims that also enhances victims’ assessment of the criminal justice process is to keep victims informed about what is happening with their cases. When this is done by the police, the victims not only see the police in a more favourable light, but also see various aspects of the criminal justice system -- particularly sentencing – more positively., Reference.

"Street gangs are not a new phenomenon in Canadian cities. A typology of gangs which divides them into three groups -- criminal organizations, street gangs, and wanna-be groups -- is important because the motivation to be involved in each of these three types of organizations is different. The most appropriate interventions vary with the type of group.",", Background. “Gangs” have been seen , at least in Vancouver, as a significant social problem for over 50 years.  It appears, at least in British Columbia, that many of the members of groups identified as gangs drifted into “membership” just as young people “drift” into membership in other groups (e.g., the Boy Scouts).   “The availability of choices is a key to understanding a person’s involvement in gangs.  If an individual has no access to, or is not encouraged to join, a mainstream group, an “illegitimate” group may be chosen instead” (p. 43).   The “phenomenon [of the gang should be] viewed along a continuum ranging from groups of friends who spend time together and who occasionally get into trouble, to more serious, organized criminal groups or gangs” (p.44)., This study examined all of those people (in custody or on probation in the Vancouver area)  identified by correctional personnel as being (or having been) involved in gangs.  The problem, however, is that “small groups of offenders were being referred to as “gangs” when the members of these groups did not see themselves that way” (p. 47).   Indeed, the “names” of gangs were sometimes imposed on a group of offenders by the news media even when the members did not consider themselves a gang, but rather saw themselves as a group of friends who sometimes offended.   Excluding these cases, there were also some “real” gangs.  The most organized ones might be described as being “criminal business organizations” which consist largely of adults who “engage in criminal activity primarily for economic reasons and almost invariably maintain a low profile” (p.48).    “Street gangs,” on the other hand, consist mainly of young adults and perceive themselves as a gang and acknowledge membership.  “Wanna-be groups” are loosely structured groups who engage in impulsive criminal activity (including violence) and want to be seen as a gang., The question, “Why do individuals become involved in gangs?” is not useful because the answer differs with the nature of the group.   Membership of criminal business organizations “is ethnically shaped and meets the economic and social needs of both organization members and their families” (p.50).  The individual motivation is primarily economic.  “Street gang” membership appeared to be more likely “a result of peer group attraction” (p.51).  Many “wanted to escape from, and find rewarding alternatives to, exceedingly unpleasant family lives” (p.51).  “Wanna-be” group members were younger than members of the other types of groups.  They were involved in less serious types of crimes, but came from disadvantaged circumstances, and had high rates of educational as well as other social or behavioural problems. “The group satisfied a variety of unmet emotional needs, especially the need for attachment -- for a sense of belonging” (p.54)., Conclusion. Membership in the various types of “gangs” appeared to be driven by different factors.  As a result, interventions attempting to reduce gang activities, then, should focus on the particular needs of potential gang members.  “Anti-gang programming appears to be most effective when it is aimed at the supply of new gang and group members, rather than existing and well-established street gang members.”  As in other areas, a focus on prevention is likely to be the most effective approach., Reference.

"Low birth weight, combined with low socioeconomic status, places children at risk for early onset (life-course-persistent) offending.",", Background.  Youth who begin offending early are more likely to persist in their offending behaviour after adolescence. Therefore, it is important to understand what causes early onset offending. A distinction has been made between “life-course persistent” and “adolescent limited” antisocial behaviour. “The cause of antisocial behaviour for the life-course persisters, according to [psychologist] Terrie Moffitt, is a result of the interaction between neuropsychological impairments and poor social environments.  This “double hazard”  of perinatal risk and social disadvantage increases the risk for deviant behavioral outcomes…” (p. 845).   Previous research has shown that  “poor neuropsychological scores were associated with early onset of delinquency for males…” (p. 846).   But what is important in this theory is that it is the “interaction between a child’s vulnerabilities to neuropsychological disorders and poor social environments that produces early onset, and not necessarily the independent influence of these determinants” (p. 847).   In other words, a child has to experience both, not just one, for an “early onset” of “life-course persistent” problem behaviour to emerge., This study looked at 987 youths from a longitudinal sample of black mothers who participated in a research project conducted in Philadelphia.   From these, a subset of 220 youths who had at least one recorded offence by age 18 were examined carefully.  This sub-sample was then divided into early onset (prior to age 14) and adolescent-onset youths. Two measures of disadvantaged environment were used: weak familial structure and poor socioeconomic status., Results. For females, the various “risk” factors and their interaction did not predict early onset.  For males, however, the combination of low birth weight and residence in a weak family structure (e.g., a large number of changes in the mother’s marital status, absence of husband/father) was likely to lead to early onset delinquency. Moreover, boys from low socioeconomic situations who were low birthweight were much more likely to be early onset delinquent youth than were those of relatively high birthweight.  For high SES boys, there was no impact of birthweight., Conclusion.  For boys, it would appear that being disadvantaged at birth and during childhood combine to create a risk of early onset, life-course persistent anti-social behaviour.  Hence, the adverse impact of low birth weight could be reduced or eliminated through social means: “Supportive environments and early interventions stand a fighting chance at diminishing the consequences of birth-related difficulties, and such approaches may have an even more demonstrable impact on inner-city youths” (p.869)., Reference: Tibbetts, Stephen G. and Alex R.

"Being abused or neglected in childhood increases both the likelihood that a child will run away from home and the likelihood that a child will become delinquent.  However, running away (even for a child who is from a non-abusive home and who is not neglected) independently increases the likelihood of being involved in delinquency.",", Background.  Running away from home clearly puts a child at risk of, among other things, being involved in delinquent behaviour. Aside from anything else, running away “introduces youth to the need and opportunities for delinquent behaviours” (p.349)., This study started with a group of 11-year old children who were found by a court to have been abused or neglected.   The researchers matched them (on age, gender, race, social class) with a control group of youth who had not been neglected or abused. They were then located when they were in their late 20s and interviewed., The data show unambiguously that abused/neglected children were much more likely to have run away during adolescence. In addition, children who had run away were much more likely to have had at least one juvenile arrest.  “Being abused or neglected remains a significant predictor of juvenile arrest, even when controlling for demographic and family factors and running away” (p. 361). Running away, on the other hand, “increases the risk for arrest for both abused and neglected and control children” (p. 365)., Conclusion. Since being abused or neglected and running away appear to each have an independent impact on future delinquency (and being abused/neglected also increases the likelihood of running away), it would appear that, in terms of preventing delinquency, one could focus on either or both of these problems.  A focus on reducing abuse and neglect is obviously important for three reasons: it may help reduce the incidence of that problem, it may reduce running away, and it can reduce delinquency.  However, these data also suggest that we need to focus attention on what it is “about the runaway experience that increases a youth’s risk for juvenile arrest....” (p. 367).   “Running away may represent a critical point for intervention, particularly if we view the runaway behaviour as a marker for subsequent high risk outcomes...  Runaway behaviour may provide us with an important opportunity to intervene positively in the lives of these youth, particularly for very young runaways and for abused and neglected children who may have the highest risk of involvement with the juvenile justice system” (p. 368).  One suspects, however, that Ontario’s “Safe Streets” Act, which, in effect, criminalizes the behaviour of runaways, would not qualify as a positive intervention., Reference.

"Everyday knowledge -- and everyday misunderstandings of the law -- can affect the way in which decisions are made.  Jurors in capital cases in the state of Georgia often have strong, and largely incorrect, views of the likelihood of release of an offender given “life” instead of the death penalty.  The legal fiction that the consequences of a decision are not relevant to the jury members is clearly not followed:  Death is recommended by juries in part because they do not know what the meaning is of a sentence of life in prison.",", Background.  Folk knowledge – everyday, taken-for-granted understandings of the world – shapes the way in which people make decisions and can shape the way in which governments respond to people. “Recent public opinion research reveals increasingly punitive attitudes in the United States.  Since the claim that punishment is too lenient is embedded in cultural understandings rather than experience with crime [or the criminal justice system], the implication that we are not now imposing enough punishment is a cultural tenet, a value judgement, not subject to empirical refutation” (p. 465)., This study examines citizens’ views of the release of offenders who have been convicted of murder.  The public generally believes that dangerous offenders are released soon after their conviction and return to their communities to commit additional crimes.   Public opinion polls in the U.S. show that large numbers of people believe that convicted murderers will be released from prison considerably earlier than they actually are under the law.  “Citizens clearly do not trust the criminal justice system to act predictably in accord with legal requirements, to the extent that they actually know what state law requires” (p.473).   Most people believe that murderers are released too early., Jurors in capital cases, in the state of Georgia, for example, appear to believe that murderers are released after 7 years when, in fact, some of them are only first considered for parole (typically at 15 years.  Furthermore, capital murderers not given the death penalty have not been eligible for parole since 1994.  The problem is that jurors deciding on whether an offender should be executed want to know what the consequences of a decision not to execute would mean.  Judges are not able to tell them since the law appears to imply that such “consequences” are irrelevant., Conclusion. When people are making decisions, the consequences of those decisions are taken into account.  When those consequences are misperceived, it is the misperception that will affect the decision.  Courts have repeatedly been reluctant to allow “ordinary jurors” to take into account the consequences of their decisions.  Thus, for example, when deciding between two possible charges, decision makers may well take into account expectations based on “folk wisdom” rather than facts when crafting a decision that is designed to accomplish a particular goal., Reference: Steiner, Benjamin D., William J.

"Imprisonment may act to disrupt informal social controls within communities.  Hence a high level of imprisonment may, itself, be a cause of crime because of the disruptive impact it has on communal life.","Background.  It is generally agreed that people’s behaviour is, to some extent, controlled by family and neighbourhood factors. The difficulty is that state controls (e.g., incarceration of offenders) can harm family and neighbourhood structures, thus interfering with the ability of the family or the neighbourhood to control crime.  Hence, “the side effects of policies intended to fight crime by controlling individual criminals may exacerbate problems that lead to crime in the first place” (p.441).  More specifically, disrupted neighbourhood organizational structures create communities “that are unable to effectively self-regulate” (p.443). Indeed, “an overreliance on public controls may diminish the capacity of private and parochial controls as communities learn to rely on outsiders” (p.446)., Evidence. Research has shown that “in very disadvantaged neighbourhoods, decreases in… informal social controls and social cohesion… result in a significant decrease in residential stability, which in turn increases the poverty of those neighbourhoods” (p.449).  The problem is that there may be a reciprocal feedback mechanism.  Crime may lead to more controls (e.g., incarceration) which interferes, obviously, with familial controls, and can lead to mobility out of the neighbourhood.  In addition, those returning from prison (to such neighbourhoods) are not reintegrated into the neighbourhood, leading to more social disorganization.  While offenders are typically seen as a liability to the area in which they live, they do contribute (money, etc.) to the communities in which they reside. “It is simplistic to view offenders as solely illegally employed… Removing many individuals may devastate the local economy” (p.460). All contributions that offenders make to communities cease when the offender is removed from the community and is imprisoned. As prisoners, they become a “resource” (and source of jobs, etc.) in communities (typically not their own) where prisons are located., Communities that produce many prisoners also, typically, show other sources of disruption.  It seems likely that they are reciprocally related: disruptive forces in the community are simultaneously causes and effects of the decision to remove people from the community.  Removal of a criminally active father from a family (and community) may create disruptive forces for the family and the community (e.g., in the family’s ability to control children).  However,  high levels of incarceration may have other impacts: crime and prison may be seen as normative. “Once experienced, prison, no matter how harsh, is transformed from an awful mystery to a real-life ordeal that has been suffered and survived…. Fear of prison… may be most potent when it is an unacquainted fear” (p.465)., Conclusion. “An overreliance on formal controls may increase disorganization by impeding other forms of control…. Concentrated within certain communities, high levels of incarceration undermine social, political, and economic systems already weakened by low levels of human and social capital produced under conditions such as high rates of poverty, unemployment, and crime” (p.467).  “A crime control strategy that looks only to coerce compliance from members of communities and that ignores the ways in which it can strengthen the neighbourhood’s internal mechanism of social control is worse than neutral.  It is self-defeating” (p.468)., Reference: Rose, Dina R. and Todd R.

"Curfew laws for juveniles have little, if any, impact on juvenile crime.  This is not surprising: they attempt to control youth during hours when they do not generally commit crimes.",", Background.  If youth crime could be curbed by the passing of simplistic laws, there would be no youth crime left against which to legislate.   In the U.S. during the 1990s, juvenile curfew laws have reappeared as popular ways of dealing with troublesome youth.  By 1995, three quarters of the 200 largest U.S. cities had curfew laws in place., The theory behind juvenile curfew laws is simple: control the hours during which youths can be in public; keep youths from getting together in groups; and give parents additional powers to control their kids.   There are two general problems with this logic.  First, the laws depend on enforcement for their effectiveness.  Second, and most importantly, while curfews generally attempt to control behaviour from late evening to early the next morning, youth crime generally peaks in the afternoon immediately after school finishes and then decreases thereafter.  Curfews, therefore, tend to prohibit juvenile mobility at times when youth are least likely to be committing crimes., This study looked at juvenile arrest data for those aged 17 and younger from 1985-96 in the 57 largest US cities. While arrests are not a perfect measure of youth involvement in crime, claims of effectiveness of simple solutions to youth crime often use these types of criminal justice process measures. In order to look at serious juvenile victimization, homicides involving juveniles as victims were also examined. These crime measures were examined as a function of the presence or absence of new curfew laws.  In addition, some jurisdictions modified their laws, providing an opportunity to examine the effect of the change, as well as the publicity that probably accompanied the change.  Because laws and data are typically kept for counties, this became the unit of analysis.  However, some cities were, in fact, counties; hence those could be examined separately.  The analyses controlled for a number of different factors: total population size, per capita income and a correlate of poverty level (infant mortality rate)., The results are simple to describe. Ten different offence (arrest) rates were examined -- ranging in seriousness from homicide and rape to theft and vandalism.   In no case did the passing of new curfew laws create a significant drop in any of these crimes at the county level. The examination of city data supports the same conclusion: curfews are ineffective. There were occasional effects of “revised” curfew laws and a finding that for cities (but not counties) new curfew laws were associated with increased homicide rates. These findings are so inconsistent that they are most likely due to other factors.   When enforcement activities (curfew arrests) were examined, they, too, appeared unrelated to arrests for other crimes.  Curfews were also unrelated to juvenile homicide victimizations., Conclusion.  An examination of the effects of curfew laws produces a simple conclusion: They do not reduce juvenile crime (or serious victimizations of youth).  As the authors of this paper state, “Our results do not encourage the idea that curfews help to prevent juvenile crime.  Any impacts of the laws were small, and they applied only to a few offences.  If curfew statutes do reduce juvenile offending and victimization rates, their influence may not be as large as policy makers have hoped.”  This conclusion is not surprising given that curfews do not typically relate to what is known about offending., Reference: McDowell, David, Colin Loftin, and Brian Wiersema.  The impact of youth curfew laws on juvenile crime rates.

"American politicians are jumping on the “get tough” bandwagon in juvenile justice by increasingly treating youth as adults.  At the same time, residents of one of the country’s more conservative states favour putting more emphasis on rehabilitation in juvenile corrections.  Are the politicians listening?",", Background. Confidence in the juvenile justice system in the U.S. has, apparently,  been declining and, perhaps as a result,  there has been a widespread erosion of the differences between the juvenile and adult justice systems.   At the same time, some national polls have suggested that “the public continues to support the correctional treatment of juveniles… [but] is less willing to support rehabilitation when this option is portrayed as a lenient response to crime or when it is suggested that an emphasis on rehabilitation will lessen the punishment given to youths” (p.43)., This study examined residents of Tennessee. The respondents were primarily white and politically conservative.  Respondents overwhelmingly favoured a rehabilitative approach over a simple punishment or “public protection” model of juvenile corrections. When asked what the main emphasis in juvenile prisons should be, 63% said it should be rehabilitation compared to 19% who favoured punishment and 11% who favoured “protecting society from future crime [the youth] might commit.”  At the same time, most respondents (92%) indicated that they agreed with the statement that “young offenders deserve to be punished because they have harmed society” (p. 48).   When asked “whether the main priority… should be to build more prisons… to lock up as many offenders as possible or to invest in ways to prevent kids from committing crimes…” most respondents (94%) chose to invest in preventive measures., Conclusion.  The finding from this survey -- that people prefer to have a justice system which favours prevention and which combines rehabilitation with holding young offenders accountable for their actions -- is not unique to the U.S.   Similar results have been reported in Canadian surveys (Sprott: Crime and Delinquency, 1998; Doob, Sprott, Marinos, and Varma, 1998; Centre of Criminology).  It would seem that people are interested in reducing youth crime and, when given choices about how to respond to crime, they choose prevention over vengeance., Reference: Moon, Melissa M., Jody L.

"Offenders see electronic monitoring as preferable to prison, though some aspects of the restrictions enforced with this technology are certainly seen as punitive.  However, Canadian experience with the technology would suggest that, like most technological solutions to social problems, electronic monitoring will not, by itself,  reduce crime.",", Background.  As a technique for knowing someone’s whereabouts, electronic monitoring (EM) has been around since the mid-1980s, apparently having been “inspired” originally by a Spiderman cartoon.  It has been used for those awaiting trial, those on probation, and those on some form of release from prison.  Its purpose is simple: it allows state authorities to monitor someone’s whereabouts.  To the extent that people receive various court orders restricting their movement, EM allows state authorities to know whether such an order is being followed.  It is not a “correctional program” per se; therefore, it is not surprising that “if the desired outcome is reduced recidivism, EM has questionable merit” (Bonta, p. 73). Nobody would think that better prison bars or better shackles would be rehabilitative, though obviously bars and shackles have their functions., These studies examine two aspects of EM.  First, it is clear that EM, as a means of enforcing court orders, is seen by those subject to it, as being better than prison, but a punishment nevertheless.  From the perspective of the electronically monitored offender, “the greatest pain was associated with the restrictive conditions that the program entails…. Shaming effects were also experienced by some offenders” (p.93)., In Canada, EM appears to be a tool that is applied to quite different populations of people in different provinces.   The Bonta et al. study examined the programs in B.C., Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland. The three programs varied dramatically in terms of the number of days that sentenced offenders were on EM. However, any apparent reduction in recidivism (in comparison with those simply on probation)  “could be explained by differences in risk levels among the groups” (p.70).   The value of EM can also be questioned from another perspective: it is not clear that its availability has consistently reduced the level of our reliance on prisons., Conclusion.  Electronic monitoring is simply a tool to determine an offender’s whereabouts.  There is variation in the sophistication of the technology and huge variation in how it is used (and at what stage of the proceedings it is applied).  Effectiveness, in terms of reduced recidivism, is much more likely to be determined by the nature of the program which an offender is in than on whether a probation officer can easily determine where the offender is.  As the authors of the Canadian study pointed out, “Can EM make a difference?  The answer depends partly on the outcome desired.”  EM can be a useful surveillance tool.  That does not mean that it is good at changing behaviour in the long run., References: Gainey, Randy R. and Brian K.

"It may be politically attractive to try to abolish parole, but parole supervision and support can be an effective way of integrating offenders back into society.  The choice is whether one is looking for effective policies or quick political gain.",", Background.  With thousands of people on parole, it is inevitable that some will commit serious offences.  When this happens, there are calls to abolish parole. “But correctional experts argue that, while abolishing parole may make good politics, it contributes to bad correctional practices -- and ultimately, less public safety” (p.480).  The difficulty in abolishing conditional release is that parole supervision and support may go with it. For example,  when offenders leave prison in Maine and Virginia, “they have no strings at all” (p.481).  The origins of parole are seen as being associated with offender rehabilitation rather than increased punitiveness or surveillance.  In the U.S., it would seem that those who have been speaking loudest for the simple abolition of parole are now becoming worried because “failure on parole is creating severe fiscal pressures on state prisons’ budgets” (p. 481). As one politician put it, “Lock ‘em up and throw away the key attitudes are coming back to haunt state legislators across the nation” (p.483).   One problem is that the public has always had mixed attitudes about parole.  Over sixty years ago (in 1934) a U.S. Gallup poll found that 82% of adults “believed that parole was not strict enough and should not be as frequently granted” (p.490)., Data related to parole.  Research would suggest that although parolees want a relatively modest, stable, conventional life after prison, most do not expect to succeed (p. 501). At the same time, services for parolees have been generally reduced, leaving parole officers focusing almost entirely on control oriented activities (p. 502).  In California, for instance, “At least 1200 inmates every year go from… an isolation unit, designed to hold the most violent and dangerous inmates in the system, right onto the street” (p. 503).  Not surprisingly, there is an increased number of special parole conditions placed on parolees, and “parole supervision has been transformed ideologically from a social service to a law enforcement system” (p.508), often with officers authorized to carry and use firearms, and to carry out searches, etc. (p.504)., Since 1995, the proportion of unsuccessful completions of parole in the U.S. has risen from about 25% to 54%.  At the moment about 34% of prisoners admitted to state institutions are parole violators.  Part of this increase may be due to the reduced availability of effective programs.  There are known programs that reduce the rearrest rate of parolees including drug and alcohol dependency programs, employment and job training, and multi-service centres that, for example, might place an emphasis on practical living skills and job training.  “No one program -- surveillance or rehabilitation alone –… can reduce crime, or fear of crime on their own” (p.522)., Conclusion. The United States currently has about 2 million people in jails and prisons, 90% of whom will be released from prison at some point.  Half will be back on the streets within two years.  If parole supervision (or any form of post-release supervision) is to be used to support reintegration, programs known to be effective need to be funded. “Given the increasing human and financial costs associated with prison, investing in effective reentry programs may well be one of the best investments we make” (p. 522)., Reference:  Petersilia, Joan.  Parole and prisoner reentry in the United States.  In Michael Tonry (ed.)

"Working women whose spouses also work have a relatively low risk of spousal abuse, but working women who are living with a man who does not work have an increased likelihood of being victimized by him.",", Background.  One of the most dramatic changes in the structure of North American society since the end of World War II has been the participation of women in the work force.  Interestingly, however, the evidence on the impact of this phenomenon on women’s likelihood of being the victim of spousal violence has been unclear.   Typically women’s employment has been conceptualized as simply a source of income.  If this were true, it would have little impact on victimization rates above and beyond family income. However, it may well be more than that. Women’s participation in the labour force could create independence for a woman (and hence it might reduce spousal violence).  Alternatively, the employment of a woman in a relationship with a man who is unemployed could be seen by him as a challenge to his traditional masculine role and, therefore, increase the victimization of the female partner., This study used data from 8461 women in the 1993 Statistics Canada “Violence against women” survey who were married or living in a common-law relationship with a man.   Looking first at the violence that the women experienced, a statistical technique determined that there are qualitatively different types of violence that women experience. These might be termed interpersonal conflict (e.g., pushing or threatening), nonsystematic abuse (e.g., the previous type plus kicking, hitting, choking), and systematic abuse (e.g., the previous two types of violence plus beating, using or threatening with a weapon, forced sex)., The results indicate that men who were unemployed were more likely to abuse their spouses.  The impact of the woman’s employment depended on whether her spouse was employed or not. “Employment increases a woman’s odds of nonsystematic abuse by 160%… when she is married to an unemployed partner yet decreases her risk by 43%… when her partner is employed.”  Similar results were found for systematic abuse: employment of the woman increased her risk if her partner was unemployed and decreased her risk if he was employed., Further analyses suggest that the effects just described relate to the use of coercive control by the husband.  Coercive control was measured by the woman’s response to questions such as “tries to limit your contact with family or friends” or “prevents you from knowing about or having access to the family income, even if you ask.”   “The symbolic threat of unemployment for men married to employed women may manifest itself in increased efforts to control them, including physical abuse” (p. 956)., Conclusion.  The impact of a woman’s employment on her likelihood of being a victim of spousal violence appears to be explained better by looking at the dynamics of the relationship that she is in rather than explaining it simply in terms of financial income.  “The effect of one partner’s employment is conditioned by the employment status of the other partner.  Women’s labour force participation thus lowers risks of spousal abuse when their male partners are also employed but substantially increases risks when their male partners are not employed” (p. 957)., Reference:  Macmillan, Ross and Rosemary Gartner.

What is the best way to predict whether a man who has assaulted his spouse will re-offend?  Ask the spouse. Her prediction is better than fancy statistical “risk” models.,", Background.  How is the justice system to respond to a woman who says that she knows best whether her assaulting spouse will re-offend? It would seem that the system should listen to her.  Practitioners and researchers have developed statistical tools for predicting the re-occurrence of wife assault.  Generally speaking, men who show aggressive behaviour in and outside of the home, men who abuse alcohol, and men whose parents were violent are likely to be violent in the home., This study asked an obvious question: how accurate are women themselves in predicting and does their ability to predict add to the accuracy of statistical models based on ""objective"" factors about the male offender, his behaviour in the past, and other readily available data., Data for this study came from couples in which the man had been found guilty of a misdemeanor assault.  The victims were interviewed shortly after the guilty finding and four months later. At the initial interview, women were asked how likely it was that their partner would be violent with them in the next year. The outcome measure (severe violence) was derived from questions such as whether the spouse reported that he had threatened to kill her, had threatened her with a weapon, had kicked, beaten, or hit her, etc., The results are quite simple.  Women are quite accurate in their predictions of whether their spouse will re-offend against them. In fact, the women’s own predictions are the best single predictor of subsequent violence. The best statistical combination of factors available to the researchers at the first interview showed only a modest relationship to subsequent serious violence. Adding in the woman's own prediction of the likelihood of him becoming violent with her during a dispute increased considerably the accuracy of the overall prediction., Conclusion.  Women who are victims of domestic assault can reasonably accurately predict whether their spouses will assault them again.  Statistical predictions, based on past history, his drinking, etc., may be useful, but it seems that the women themselves are able to predict better than any outsider can.  Hence, those who deal with victims of domestic assault should listen carefully to the predictions these women make.  When she predicts that he will, or will not, be violent in the future and requests criminal justice actions based on these predictions, the data suggest that her prediction is quite likely to be correct., Reference: Weisz, Arlene N, Richard M. Tolman, and Daniel G. Saunders.  Assessing the risk of severe domestic violence.  Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 2000, 15¸ 75-90., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV3N2.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-3-no-2-%E2%80%93-may-2000,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 3, No. 2 – May 2000",Regular Issue,2000
"Why criminalize domestic assault?  The typical justification is to protect the victim from further assaults through arrest and prosecution.  However,  the women who are the victims of domestic assault often do not want their spouses prosecuted.  The alternative approach is a victim empowered approach which might be used to bring “a full range of social and legal forces to bear on domestic violence problems” (p.33).",", Background.  The standard reasons given for criminalizing (charging and prosecuting) domestic assault include denunciation, general deterrence, and individual deterrence. These are the “standard” reasons given for criminalizing most crimes, but, for most crimes, there is not a risk that the situation of the victim will be worsened by prosecution., This study examined carefully the experiences of 65 female victims of domestic assault who came to the attention of the police in England.  The police force in question, like many police forces in Canada, had pro-arrest policies in place, notwithstanding the fact that no compelling data exist to suggest that such policies serve as an individual or general deterrent to domestic violence., The preferences of the women in this study did not fit the “pro-prosecution” model very well.  Only 31 of the 65 women had wanted “their” offender to be prosecuted, but even of those who did want their spouse arrested, the majority “did not want him to be prosecuted.  They wanted an arrest without any further criminal justice intervention to ‘teach him a lesson’ or to resolve the immediate situation temporarily” (p.22).   Women wanted the police to calm the perpetrator (7 of the women) or to warn him (4 of the women).   Two main reasons were given for not wanting prosecution: the arrest accomplished what the victim wanted, and the perceived “costs” outweighed the possible benefits.  These costs included, not surprisingly, fear of retaliation.  As one woman put it, she felt she was in a “no win” situation where prosecution would put her at additional risk.   The difficulty, of course, is that many of the women were not ready to end the relationship they were in; hence, they were making a calculated choice.  There are indications that “arrest and prosecution can give victims the confidence to ‘do something’ about violence, in particular to end the relationship, but it may have little or no effect unless it is coupled with further, more supportive action” (p. 27).   Arrest alone had little impact, or where there was an impact, its effect was just as likely to be seen as negative as positive., Conclusion. Given that women do not invariably prefer pro-arrest and pro-prosecution policies, and given that these policies have not been demonstrated to protect women, policy makers should re-think the value of these policies. Another model suggests that women’s preferences and choices in these situations be seen as rational choices, given the circumstances that they face.   Since women are reasonably good at predicting the re-occurrence of domestic assault  (See Weisz et al, this issue of Highlights), one might suggest that their wishes be given greater weight.  A pro-arrest (but not a pro-prosecution) policy, then, might be used “as a way of bringing a full range of social and legal forces to bear on domestic violence problems” (p.33)., Reference: Hoyle, Carolyn and Andrew Sanders.  Police response to domestic violence.

"Systematically measured neighbourhood disorder (“broken windows”) does not cause crime in a community. “The current fascination in policy circles… on cleaning up disorder through law enforcement appears simplistic and largely misplaced, at least in terms of directly fighting crime” (p.638).   “Broken windows” may be more prevalent in high crime areas, but the data suggest that disorder is not directly responsible for crime.","Background.  The idea that “fixing broken windows” will reduce crime has been popularized, but never demonstrated empirically, by various criminologists such as George Kelling and James Q. Wilson.  The notion they have popularized, based on the metaphor of broken windows,  is that “public incivilities – even if relatively minor as in the case of broken windows, drinking in the street, and graffiti – attract predatory crime because potential offenders assume from them that residents are indifferent to what goes on in their neighbourhood” (p. 604).  Politicians in favour of crackdowns who are looking for a political “quick fix” find “broken windows” an attractive theory. The alternate theory is that “structural constraints such as resource disadvantage and mixed land use account for both crime and disorder simultaneously” (p. 614)., This study reports a careful examination of the “broken windows” theory of crime by first getting an independent observation by researchers of how “disordered” (socially and physically) neighbourhoods (in Chicago) actually were.  Social disorder (e.g., adults loitering or congregating, drinking alcohol in public, drug selling) and physical disorder (e.g., presence of garbage or litter, graffiti, abandoned cars) were quite highly correlated. Not surprisingly, “disordered” neighbourhoods were poorer, more likely to have high concentrations of immigrants, and lower in “collective efficacy” (willingness of neighbours to “do something” in response to problems, trusting one’s neighbours, neighbourhood social cohesion, etc.).  Collective efficacy has been found in previous studies to be an important predictor of neighbourhood crime above and beyond characteristics of the individuals in the neighbourhood., The most important findings, however, were that measures of social and physical disorder (“broken windows”) were not related to personal violence and household burglary (assessed by victimization measures) once characteristics of the neighbourhood (e.g., collective efficacy, mixed land use) had been controlled for. “The results are consistent and point to a spurious association of disorder with predatory crime” (p. 627).  When one looks at officially recorded crime, “disorder” once again disappears as a predictor of homicide and burglary once measures of collective efficacy and prior crime rates are controlled for.  “The key result is that the influences of structural characteristics and collective efficacy on burglary, robbery, and homicide are not mediated by neighbourhood disorder” (p. 629).  The exception is the case of officially recorded measures of robbery where there is still a relationship with disorder. Whether this is due to a “complex feedback loop” (p. 637) or an artifact of official data (e.g., “citizen calls to the police or police accuracy in recording robberies is greater in areas perceived to be high in disorder” --p. 638) is not clear., Conclusion.  “The active ingredients in crime seem to be structural disadvantage and attenuated collective efficacy more than disorder.  Attacking public disorder through police tactics may thus be a politically popular but perhaps analytically weak strategy to reduce crime, mainly because such a strategy leaves the common origins of both [disorder and crime], but especially the last [crime] untouched.  A more subtle approach suggested by this article would look to how informal but collective efforts among residents to stem disorder may provide unanticipated benefits for increasing collective efficacy... in the long run lowering crime” (p. 638)., Reference: Sampson, Robert J. and Stephen W.

"Partner abuse and “general crime” are related: those likely to commit one type of crime are likely to commit the other.  However, the two kinds of criminal behaviour are different in that general crime is related to low self-control, but partner abuse is not.  These findings apply to both men and women.",", Background.  “Evidence is accumulating to suggest that many, if not most, partner abusers do not specialize, but engage in violence against nonintimates as well as a variety of non-violent crime” (p. 201).  Generally speaking,  “childhood and adolescent antecedents of adult partner violence are remarkably reminiscent of the risk factors for general crime” (p. 202).  However, there is some evidence that there are some personality factors that are different for those who commit “general crime” compared to those who commit partner abuse., This study focuses on two personality constructs: 
“Constraint” (where people characterize themselves as reflective, cautious, careful, preferring safe activities, etc.) or more typically what criminologists often refer to as “self-control”  and  
“Negative emotionality” (where people describe themselves as nervous, prone to worry, unable to cope with stress, etc.)., These characteristics were measured in a representative sample of  New Zealand 18-year olds.  When these same people were 21 years old, self-report measures of general crime (theft, fraud, vice, physical force) and partner abuse (including, but not limited to physical violence) were obtained. Unlike many studies, this study examined both men and women. 
 
The findings suggest that, consistent with other studies, physical abuse of one’s partner was highly correlated with psychological abuse.  In addition, there was a moderate relationship (r=.39) between general crime and partner abuse.  Looking only at physical abuse of one’s partner and violent crimes against persons other than partners, for both males and females, those who commit one form of violence are likely to commit the other., For both males and females, those high on “negative emotionality” were more likely to be involved in general crime and in partner abuse.  “Constraint,” however, was related to general crime but was not related to partner abuse.  Very similar findings were obtained when “violent crime” and “partner violence” were examined.  In other words, while “partner abuse and general crime represent different constructs that are moderately related, they are not merely two expressions of the same underlying anti-social  propensity” (p.219)., Conclusion.  These findings suggest that certain personality characteristics – specifically, “negative emotionality” which is related to an inability to cope with stress, having a low threshold for feeling tense, fearful, and angry, etc. -- are related to violence against partners and non-intimates for both men and women.  “Constraint,”  on the other hand,  does not seem to be related to partner abuse but is related to more general types of crime.  Hence the two forms of anti-social behaviour (partner abuse and general crime) are not related to exactly the same constellation of personality characteristics.  Interventions aimed at those who commit anti-social acts against intimates and non-intimates, therefore, need to take account of both the overlap between the two and the differences., Reference:  Moffitt, Terrie E., Robert F.

"Most sex offenders placed on probation do not reoffend.  In particular, those with stable employment histories who receive sex-offence treatment are less likely to reoffend than those without such characteristics.",", Background.  Previous research has found that “incarceration had an indirect effect on reoffending: It reduced job stability, and this instability in turn contributed to continual involvement in crime” (p. 64).  In contrast, other theoretical frameworks that focus largely on traits developed early in life view “crime as highly resistant to both informal social controls... and … the formal controls exerted by the criminal justice system” (p. 64-5).   Although sex offenders are, in many countries, increasingly subject to punitive approaches, many of those who have committed sex offences serve at least part of their sentences in the community.  Hence it is possible to see whether social bonds to employment and family can reduce crime or, alternatively, if treatment strategies are a waste of time., This study looked at 556 sex offenders in Minnesota from the time they were placed on probation in 1992 through June 1997.  Hence it under-represents the worst sex offenders but does include the majority of those identified as sex offenders during the period of study.  Formal social control was operationalized as drug testing, prohibitions against contact with minors, and compulsory treatment., Results.  Reoffending of any kind (as measured by official re-arrest measures) was more likely to occur soon after the offender was placed on probation.  After a year, 83% had not reoffended, and after two years, 75% had not reoffended.  Five years after being placed on probation 65% had not reoffended.  During the five years, only 10% were ever rearrested for any offence against persons, and only 5.6% had committed a new sex offence. Those with a long criminal history and a history of drug use were more likely to re-offend. Not surprisingly, older probationers were less likely to commit any new offence.  Even though 36% of the original offences involved family members, those living with their families during the probation period were not more likely to reoffend., Generally speaking, job stability appeared to be related to lower rates of overall offending and crimes against persons.    Sex offender treatment, alone, did not appear to be effective.  However, for those with stable employment, sex offender treatment appeared to be useful in reducing all types of reoffending.  “In fact, for the small number of respondents whose reoffence was a new sex offence, the only factor that even marginally reduces their risk of reoffending is the combined effect of stable employment and sex offender treatment” (p. 81)., Conclusion.  For this group of sex offenders, who were given non-custodial sentences, it appears that community approaches can be effective in reducing reoffending and that scarce treatment resources can be effectively allocated.  Most of these offenders did not reoffend and, when they did, it was most likely not a sex offence.  The findings, showing a positive impact of stable employment (especially when combined with treatment), suggest that informal social controls can be important in understanding reoffending., Reference: Kruttschnitt, Candace, Christopher Uggen, and Kelly Shelton.  Predictors of desistance among sex offenders: The interaction of formal and informal social controls.  Justice Quarterly, 2000, 17, 61-87., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV3N3.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-3-no-3-%E2%80%93-july-2000,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 3, No. 3 – July 2000",Regular Issue,2000
All conditional sentences are not created equal: The public is much more likely to accept a conditional sentence as a substitute for prison if there are conditions attached that are clearly punitive.,", Background. The controversy surrounding the conditional sentence of imprisonment did not end with the recent Supreme Court of Canada decisions on the appropriateness of this sanction.  Part of the controversy involves questions of what a conditional sentence “looks like.”   It is understandable that for many members of the public a conditional sentence may look remarkably like a term of probation since, after all, both involve sanctions served in the community.  What courts seem to be saying is that a conditional sentence must involve a visible component of “punishment.”  The punishment, in turn, is meant to serve the purposes of denunciation and deterrence – sanctions typically associated with prison., This study examined, in a national public opinion survey, the public acceptability of a conditional sentence.  The sentence was described (to different groups of people) in two different ways. One group of respondents was told that a judge was deciding whether to sentence an offender found guilty of a break, enter, and theft to a 6 month prison sentence or to 6 months to be served in the community as a conditional sentence.  The other (equivalent) group was given the same choice but was told that the conditional sentence would include, as conditions imposed by the judge, each of the following: a weekend and evening curfew, restitution and community work., The results demonstrate that a little bit of punitiveness went a long way.  When choosing between prison and the conditional sentence (without punitive conditions) only 28% indicated that the conditional sentence was their choice.  With the additional punitive sanctions, the conditional sentence was endorsed by 65% of the respondents. “The creative use of appropriate optional conditions can have a dramatic impact on community reaction to the imposition of a conditional sentence” (p.119)., Part of the difficulty with conditional sentences, then, may be that punitive optional conditions are not routinely imposed.  The data from a sample of conditional sentences and probation orders in Ontario suggest that most optional conditions are as likely to be imposed in the case of probation as they are for conditional sentences.  The exceptions to this generalization are that abstaining from drugs and observing a curfew (both of which are no doubt seen as being punitive) are more likely to be used for conditional sentences.  Weapons restrictions were also more likely to be imposed in the case of conditional sentences (perhaps because of the severity of the offences involved).  There was also provincial variation in the imposition of optional conditions., Conclusion.  Punitive non-carceral conditions made part of a conditional sentence order can have dramatic effects on the acceptability of a conditional sentence.  While the public might not like the idea of a conditional sentence in the abstract, these sanctions can be made acceptable if conditions are attached to them that appear to be capable of fulfilling the purposes traditionally attributed to imprisonment., Reference:  Roberts, Julian V., Dan Antonowicz, and Trevor Sanders.  Conditional sentences of imprisonment: An empirical analysis of optional conditions.

Three strikes puts courtroom officials in the hotbox: California’s three-strikes legislation has a disruptive impact on the processing of serious cases.,", Background:  The California 3-strikes law is one of the harshest 3-strikes laws in the U.S. On the second felony conviction, offenders get twice the “normal” sentence that would apply to their offence.  The third strike gets 3-times the punishment that would apply to first offenders or 25 years to life, whichever is longer.  This third strike sentence is imposed even if the third strike is for a minor felony. Hence an offender can get 25-years- to-life for a minor felony., An examination of California’s 3-strikes laws shows the reality of the administration of overly harsh laws.  When the law was brought in, the assumption made by many was that the administration of the law would be undermined by judges, prosecutors, and defence counsel who would not implement the law as written. This is not what universally occurred., This study interviewed and surveyed judges, prosecutors, and public defenders in five large California counties.  “Both methods indicate that Three Strikes has significantly disrupted the efficiency of the courtroom and has made the prediction of case outcomes difficult” (p. 192).  For example, in four of the five counties studied, it appears that almost all prior strikes were introduced into evidence.   Plea bargaining became difficult because it became difficult to predict when prosecutors would be willing to dismiss prior “strike” allegations.   On the other hand, there was some evidence that judges were more willing to ignore prior convictions in counties where prosecutors went by the book., “The greatest effect of Three Strikes for workgroup (judges, prosecutors, defence) members has been an increase in trials….  Three strikes prohibits such deals [where a guilty plea is substituted for a lesser punishment].  Defendants who face extended prison terms are unlikely to agree to plead guilty…. Overall the felony trial rate is higher than before Three Strikes….”  (p. 198), “Recognizing [the possibility of jury nullification], public defenders attempt to inform the jury that the current offence is a third strike” (p. 199).   But even though judges “routinely offered second strike defendants the lowest possible sentence, seemingly to encourage defendants to plead guilty… substantial numbers of [prosecutors, lawyers and judges] believed that they could not predict which cases were likely candidates for leniency” (p. 201)., Conclusion: It is clear that the 3-strikes law in California is having a disruptive impact on the sensible running of the courts.  Because the law requires disproportionately severe sentences to large numbers of offenders, there are efforts (some successful) to avoid the harshness of the law.  The result is inconsistency in the application of the law and in the outcome of criminal cases in California., Reference:  Harris, John C. and Paul Jesilow.  It’s not the Old Ball game:  Three strikes and the courtroom workgroup.  Justice Quarterly, 2000,  17, 185 –203., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV3N3.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-3-no-3-%E2%80%93-july-2000,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 3, No. 3 – July 2000",Regular Issue,2000
"Young male and female victims of violence look remarkably like young violent offenders.  They are likely to be involved in offending; they have difficult childhoods, and they are likely to be living relatively “risky” lives.",", Background.  Young people are, in general, more likely to be victims of a violent crime than are members of the general population.  This study examines who, among a representative sample of young people, are most likely to be victims of violence., This study focuses on a group of 1024 New Zealand children born in 1977 and followed until they were 18 years old. 14% of the females and 23% of the males in this representative sample of youths reported being physically assaulted when they were between the ages of 16 and 18. Eleven percent of the assaults against the young women occurred in the context of a sexual assault.  Most of the assaults were minor: Only 2 of the 188 youths who were assaulted required admission to a hospital although 17% indicated that  they had needed medical attention.  The study examines the contextual as well as the background factors associated with victimization., Those who had been assaulted between the ages of 16 and 18 were much more likely to report involvement in various types of offending (violent, property, drug or alcohol use). They were also more likely than those who were not assaulted to be associating with “deviant or anti-social” peers. “The psychosocial profile of physical assault victims was that of a group of young people characterized by elevated rates of risk-taking behaviour and deviant peer affiliations” (p. 246)., Young victims of violence were more likely than non-victims to come from difficult backgrounds (e.g., lower income and families characterized by parental offending, alcohol and drug abuse, family conflict, and regular physical punishment).  More detailed analyses suggest that “a history of early adolescent conduct problems and exposure to parental alcohol problems may uniquely contribute to the prediction of physical assault [victimization] even after current behaviour and lifestyle factors have been taken into account” (p.250-251).  “The risk factors and life pathways associated with physical assault were similar for both males and females” (p. 251)., Conclusion. “For both males and females, the profile of those [youths] at greatest risk [of violent victimization] was that of a young, conduct disordered, adolescent reared by physically punitive and substance-abusing parents, who upon reaching late adolescence, engaged in antisocial and other risk-taking behaviour” (p. 254)., Reference:  Woodward, Lianne J. and David M.

"Canadians generally support both the Charter and the Supreme Court.  In certain controversial areas (e.g., gay rights) Canadians appear to be moving in the direction of endorsing positions consistent with those taken by the Supreme Court.",", Background. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms has seen a lot of controversy in its 18 year life.  In addition,  the courts, and the Supreme Court in particular, have been criticized for, among other things, having the last word on public policy issues. The results of a recent survey suggest that Canadians support the Charter and the way in which it has changed the Canadian political landscape., This study examined Canadians’ views of the Charter in 1999 comparing these recent views to those expressed in a 1987 survey.  Some of the highlights of the survey are as follows:, Conclusions.  Support for the Charter, as well as support for some controversial Charter issues, appears to be high among most geographic and political groups in Canada.  Although some opposition can be found to certain decisions, it would appear that the courts have succeeded in staying in tune with or in leading public opinion., Reference:  Fletcher, Joseph F. and Paul Howe.  Canadian attitudes toward the Charter and the Courts in comparative perspective.   Supreme Court Cases and Court Support: The State of Canadian Public Opinion.

"Jurors need help to do an effective and efficient job.  Most jurors are competent to do their job, but “many of them confronted significant difficulties in doing so because they were not provided with adequate tools” (p. 89).",", Background.  Juries may not be used very often, but they are seen as being a “cornerstone of the criminal justice system.”  In Canada, we know little about the operation of actual juries in part because of statutory rules prohibiting the disclosure of information about what goes on during deliberations., This study examines juries in 48 New Zealand trials in a variety of ways: pre-service questionnaires given to jurors, observations and examinations of transcripts,  and interviews with the judge and with jurors., Jurors, generally, “felt unprepared for the nature of the task and expressed concerns about the responsibilities inherent in jury duty” (p. 90-91).  One difficulty is that jurors’ jobs -- “passive observers and recorders of information who suspend judgement on the evidence and issues until they retire for deliberations” (p. 91) -- do not reflect the way in which research shows that people normally make judgements.  “It is scarcely surprising, therefore, to find that a significant number of jurors were critical of the fact that they failed to receive an adequate factual and legal framework at the commencement of the trial” (p. 91).  Various straightforward ways of providing jurors with an adequate legal framework exist but are not typically used in trials (see p. 92).  Part of the problem jurors have is in following and remembering details of the evidence.  Hence there is clear support for addressing the manner in which jurors get and retain information. Almost 80% of the jurors said that they wanted to ask at least one question but, given that they are discouraged from doing so, few did., The deliberations in a number of trials were described as “unstructured, disorganized and inadequately facilitated.  As a result the jury often foundered.... Success in [the role of the foreperson] rested on the extent to which the foreperson was able to bring some coherent structure to [the jury’s] discussions” (p. 96).   Compromises by jurors “to produce guilty verdicts on some charges and not guilty verdicts on other charges” (p. 97) occurred in five of the 48 cases.  At the same time, “Jurors were, with few exceptions, highly conscientious, took the role very seriously, and were extremely concerned to ensure that they did the right thing” (p. 97).  “Despite the fact that jurors generally found the judge’s instructions... clear and helpful..., there were widespread misunderstandings about aspects of the law in 35 of the 48 trials which persisted through to, and significantly influenced, jury deliberations” (p. 98).   However, “by and large these errors were addressed by the collective deliberations of the jury and did not influence the verdict of the majority of the cases” (p. 98).  It appeared, however, that in 4 of the 48 cases, the verdict was affected by misunderstandings of their legal instructions., Judges were asked, before the jury returned, what their verdicts would have been.  The most notable disagreement relates to 3 of the 48 trials where the disagreement was complete: in 2 cases the jury acquitted and the judge would have convicted, and in one case the jury convicted and the judge would have acquitted., Conclusion:  The quality of jury deliberations, and perhaps verdicts, could be improved if the difficulties facing the jurors -- difficulties which trial judges typically do not have -- were addressed.  “If [the necessary tools] were provided... most of the problems identified here would be overcome or substantially mitigated.”  It appears that legal change is, for the most part, not required.  A change in mindset is, however., Reference:  Young, Warren, Yvette Tinsley, and Neil Cameron.  The effectiveness and efficiency of jury decision-making.  Criminal Law Journal, 2000, 24, 89-100., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV3N3.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-3-no-3-%E2%80%93-july-2000,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 3, No. 3 – July 2000",Regular Issue,2000
Inmates in jails with healthy “organizational climates” are less likely to be the targets of physical force from correctional staff: Good correctional management can make a difference to the way in which staff treat inmates.,"Background.  County jails in the U.S. have been described as the “sewers of the justice system” (p. 1).  Typically, there are few programs available since jail inmates are either awaiting trial or serving relatively short sentences. The use of force, or its threatened use, is common.  When trying to understand the use of force in jails and other correctional facilities, the focus is typically on individual variables (e.g., education, race, personality) rather than on the nature of the organization., This study examined the manner in which the organizational characteristics of seven Arizona jails were perceived by prison officers.  Officers were asked questions about the “organizational climate” of their workplace on eight dimensions, such as their perception of the quality of supervision they received, their levels of fear, and their feeling of having adequate authority (e.g., “I feel I have more than enough power to keep inmates in line around here.”)  The officers’ readiness to use force was measured by asking such questions as the officer’s degree of agreement with the statement “When in doubt, it’s almost always better to use force to get results rather than just keep talking to an inmate” (p. 10)., The results show that the readiness to use force in dealing with problems was associated with each of the following:, Individual characteristics (age, education, race, etc.) did not help predict who was most ready to use force in the jail setting., Conclusion: Perceptions of the organizational climate are related to the officers’ stated readiness to use force on the job.  Clearly the impact of the organizational climate on the use of force is complex: there were other dimensions that did not appear to be as important. The results can be seen as encouraging for those who are concerned with the inappropriate use of force by prison officers in that the findings suggest that “good management” can make a difference above and beyond any relevant characteristics of the individual prison officer., Reference: Griffin, Marie L.  The influence of organizational climate on detention officer’s readiness to use force in a county jail.

"Prison vocational education programs, community employment programs, adult education programs, and life skills programs for offenders may reduce recidivism, but the results are neither consistent nor conclusive.   The results of some programs may be “promising” but the results vary enough that one cannot assume that any particular program will reduce reoffending.",", Background.  Vocational, educational, and life skills programs have been staples of correctional programming for years.  The difficulty is that there have been relatively few adequate assessments of their impact.  Hence their correctional value cannot be assumed to be positive., This review looked at the research literature on these programs, using a recently developed standard to determine the degree of rigor of the research methods.  The highest standard was given to “true experiments” where program participants were assigned, on a random basis, to receive either the program or not.  A slightly lower standard involved various research methodologies typically employing some other form of comparison group.  Such ratings of the value of studies are important to avoid giving the same “weight” to a carefully controlled study as to a totally inadequate study when drawing conclusions., Various types of programs were examined:, The findings were simultaneously encouraging and discouraging.   The results tended to be discouraging because many programs showed no differences in recidivism between those who received the “treatment” and those who did not.  At best, one can be “cautiously optimistic” (perhaps with an emphasis on the “caution”) in suggesting that such programs generally reduce reoffending, or re-entry into the justice system (e.g., through parole violations). “There is some evidence to suggest that work release programs... have modest effects on recidivism” (p. 31).  “While the results are somewhat inconclusive, several studies of sufficient scientific merit found evidence that the recidivism of participants was lower than a reasonable comparison group of offenders” (p. 32)  “This assessment of the evaluation literature of adult basic education and life skills programs yields inconclusive results....[The] effects varied greatly depending on the particular populations targeted” (p. 215). The more optimistic conclusion is that some of these “standard” correctional programs, for some groups of offenders, showed some positive impacts., Conclusion.  It would appear that simple across-the-board positive correctional effects of standard employment, education, and life skills programs are not likely to be found.  Without doubt the results depend on the exact program in place, the characteristics of the offenders in the program, and the outcome measures of interest.  The lesson for correctional administrators would seem to be that careful evaluation, using multiple outcome measures, is necessary for the particular program of interest.  One cannot assume that these programs will “work” just because a similar program has had positive impacts elsewhere., References: Bouffard, Jeffrey A., Doris Layton MacKenzie, and Laura J.

"Juvenile and adult “graduates” of boot camps do not appear to be any less likely to reoffend than those who have been released from traditional correctional institutions.  However, there are positive lessons to be learned from boot camp environments: young people perceive the boot camp environment to be safer, more controlled, more structured and more active than that of traditional facilities.",", Background.  Boot camp graduates appear to do no better in the community upon release than those released from traditional correctional facilities. Recidivism and participation in constructive activities in the community (e.g., work and school) on release do not appear to be affected by the boot camp experience. It appears that any positive impacts of boot camps are related to the nature of the aftercare programs that are often attached to boot camps.  Boot camps are, however, different from traditional institutions., This study examines the perception of boot camps by juvenile inmates. In many studies, prisons have been found to be places where youth feel afraid and bored. Twenty-two pairs of juvenile institutions were compared: a boot camp and the state facility where the youth would have gone if he had not been sent to the boot camp. Thirteen different “conditions of confinement” were measured using questionnaires. Clearly, there are lessons to be learned from the operation of boot camps.  In at least three quarters of the pairs of institutions, inmates of boot camps tended to see their institution as having more therapeutic programs, more planned activities, more structure and control, and to be better preparing them for release than traditional juvenile institutions. Boot camp inmates also felt less at risk from other inmates, and from the correctional environment generally. However, not all boot camps were seen as being better than their “unbooted” counterpart. On some dimensions -- danger from staff, quality of life, and freedom -- there were significant differences across the pairs of institutions with the boot camp sometimes looking better and sometimes worse than the traditional prison., Conclusion.  Clearly one of the advantages of having highly structured environments is that juvenile inmates feel safer and feel that someone cares about what happens to them. These are important dimensions to consider since an environment which is safe from violence presumably constitutes a minimum standard for incarcerated youth.  If boot camps do have “healthier” atmospheres on some dimensions than traditional prisons for youth, one can ask why they are not more effective in changing behaviour.  It may be that, although youths perceive that they are receiving better programming and, as a result, they perceive that the institution cares for them, the programming that they are given in the institution may not be addressing the circumstances which are responsible for their being in prison in the first place., Reference: Styve, Gaylene J., Doris Layton MacKenzie, Angela R.

"Community Service works: Those offenders given short prison sentences are, if anything, more likely to re-offend than equivalent offenders given community service.",", Background.  Community service orders (CSOs) have become popular in many countries, including Canada, because they are seen as a less expensive alternative to prison.  This study takes the examination of CSOs one step further and looks at the recidivism rates of offenders randomly assigned to CSOs or to a short period of incarceration., This study, in one district in Switzerland, compared the impact of a CSO to a short (up to 14 days) prison sentence.  If an offender sentenced to a short stay in prison were found to be eligible for community work, the offender was given the option of being assigned,  on a random basis, to community work rather than prison.  Because the assignment was random, the two groups (prison and CSO) can be assumed to be equivalent on all pre-existing dimensions., The results, in general, showed no significant difference on the likelihood of being re-convicted  or the average number of convictions within 24 months of the prison/CSO experience.  However, when “re-arrest” data were examined, it appeared that those who were assigned to do community service were somewhat less likely to be re-arrested than those who served their sentences in prison. 
Immediately after serving their sanction, all participants in the study answered a number of questions. In comparison with those who went to prison, the offenders who experienced community service were more likely to report that they believed that the sanction they received would reduce recidivism, and was fair.  Those who went to prison were more likely to indicate that they no longer had a “debt” to society and were more likely to believe that the sentencing judge (but not the correctional authorities) had been unfair., Conclusion.  Clearly, short prison sentences are no better, and may be worse, than community service.  It is possible that one reason why community service orders may be better is that offenders feel that they were dealt with fairly by the system.  Thus this paper -- using what is sometimes referred to as the “gold standard” in evaluation research, the randomized controlled experiment -- serves as one more nail in the coffin of the belief in the “short sharp shock.”, Reference: Killias, Martin, Marcelo Aebi and Denis Ribeaud.  Does community service rehabilitate better than short-term imprisonment?: Results of a controlled experiment.

"One cannot talk about “sentencing guidelines” without specifying “which” guidelines one is referring to. Some guideline systems have been in existence for over 20 years and have clearly accomplished many, if not most, of their goals.  Guideline systems can be an effective means of achieving important goals in sentencing, but guideline systems, like sentencing laws generally, can have different goals and can vary in their achievement of these goals.",", Background.  Seventeen U.S. states as well as the U.S. federal courts have guideline systems.  All state guideline systems are more flexible than the federal guidelines. Unlike the federal guidelines which try to regulate every aspect of each sentence, the state guidelines are typically simple and easily accessible to both court personnel and the public., Guideline systems vary enormously, though most of them have some form of permanent commission to monitor the system.  They vary in their form (e.g., an offence by criminal record “grid” or a “point system”), whether there is effective appellate review, whether the guidelines are explicitly supposed to take into account correctional resources, and their breadth (e.g., whether they include misdemeanors or the use of non-custodial sanctions).  In addition, although many states abolished parole release when they brought in sentencing guidelines, not all followed this practice.  Guidelines also vary dramatically with respect to their level of legal enforceability (e.g., running from “advisory” to almost mandatory)., The goals of guideline systems have varied across time and state.  Reducing disparity was an early goal of some systems (e.g., Minnesota) but this has been replaced -- often by an approach described as “limited retributivism” whereby the goal is largely to ensure that sentences are neither excessively severe nor unduly lenient. Criminal record is typically given substantial emphasis on the assumption that it is an indication of future dangerousness. State guideline systems often give “strong priority to the use of state prison space for violent and repeat offenders” (p. 76)., The federal guidelines have quite a different record from those in most state systems, and have, among other things, deprived trial courts of “needed flexibility”, ignored the impact on prisons, and required judges to increase sentences for behaviour not part of the convicted offences. Finally, they are remarkably complex (over 400 pages compared to Minnesota’s 65 pages)., Guideline systems obviously create different balances of power between legislatures (and their sentencing commissions) and judges.  Sentencing Commissions have developed independent expertise in advising legislatures on policy concerns. “There is considerable evidence that sentencing guidelines can help to avoid prison overcrowding and the kind of dramatic (and very expensive) escalation in prison populations which has occurred in many non-guidelines states in the past 20 years” (p. 75).  Hence, they may help to protect sentencing systems from the winds of legislative whims. Two persistent challenges to guideline systems have been the regulation of prosecutorial discretion and plea bargaining; and the encouragement of the use of  non-custodial sanctions., Conclusion. Sentencing guideline systems vary enormously across jurisdictions. They have been relatively successful in developing “rational” sentencing policies. It is clear that they can (but not necessarily do) result in sentencing structures that accomplish their desired goals.   However, having “guidelines” does not guarantee “success,” often because what constitutes “success” is still being debated., Reference: Frase, Richard S.

Mandatory sentences fail again.  The various goals associated with mandatory sentences in Australia have not been achieved and governments in Australia may have recognized this fact.,", Background.  Mandatory sentences in Australia, as elsewhere, are the election-obsessed legislator’s best criminal justice friend.  The “three strikes” species of mandatory sentence found its way to Australia in the 1990s.  Mandatory (prison) sentences did, however, come under fire in early 2000 when the predictable types of cases occurred and were  publicized -- mandatory imprisonment for a yo-yo thief, a year in prison for an Aboriginal man who stole a towel from a washing line to use as a blanket, and a prison sentence for a one-legged pensioner who damaged a hotel fence. The laws in Western Australia and the Northern Territory were written broadly enough to ensure that these types of cases would result in a prison sentence., The rationales that have been given for mandatory sentencing laws in Australia, as elsewhere, have varied over time.  In the lineup of justifications, selective incapacitation was first at bat. However, selective incapacitation was shown to be a failure. Next at bat was general deterrence.  General deterrence struck out for the same reason: the evidence was clear that crime rates were unaffected by mandatory minimums. Third at bat, after the first two struck out, was the view that the laws reflected “community concern,” the government claiming, not very convincingly, that the first two justifications had never been used (p. 169).  The two state governments’ approaches appeared to be that if the law doesn’t seem to “work”, what constitutes “success” should be changed., Notwithstanding the fact that the laws clearly increased the likelihood of a prison sentence and they received a lot of publicity (good conditions for deterrence effects), there is “compelling evidence” that the laws did not achieve a deterrent effect (p. 172).   Not surprisingly, particularly for juveniles, there was judicial motivation to avoid some of the harshest applications of mandatory sentencing laws.  Part of the reason for this was the obvious one: proportionality in sentencing was trumped by mandatory sentences.  Ironically, the government cited judicial inventiveness in avoiding unduly harsh applications of the law as an argument that the laws were not in breach of U.N. conventions (p.177).  In effect, the law was not inappropriate, because it was being successfully avoided!   Nevertheless, given that Aboriginal children are over-represented in the courts (they are less likely to be diverted, for example), the laws appeared to affect them more than non-aboriginal children., Conclusion: Australians have learned that mandatory sentences do not have clear and consistent objectives, and that whatever the objectives might be, they do not seem to be achieved. “We also know that [mandatory sentencing laws] lead to disproportionate sentences, subvert legal processes, and have a profoundly discriminatory impact” (p. 182).  However, “there are signs that these lessons have been learned” (p. 182). Governments “have effectively conceded that mandatory sentences have no deterrent effect, and that there is a need for judicial discretion and for the more vigorous use of diversionary schemes and alternative strategies” (p. 182)., Reference: Morgan, Neil.  Mandatory sentences in Australia: Where have we been and where are we going?  Criminal Law Journal, 2000, 24, 164-183., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV3N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-3-no-4-%E2%80%93-october-2000,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 3, No. 4 – October 2000",Regular Issue,2000
Curfews for juveniles do not reduce crime.,", Background. Eighty percent of the 200 largest cities in the U.S. have juvenile curfew laws.  New Orleans, Louisiana, has the most restrictive juvenile curfew of all U.S. cities:  Youths under 17 are prohibited from being in public places, unless accompanied by an adult, after 8 p.m. on weekdays and 11 p.m. on weekends during the school year.  During the summer, youths can stay out until 9 p.m.  The twist in the New Orleans law is that the youth’s legal guardian can be fined, ordered to take counseling or do parenting courses, or ordered to do community service.  Business operators can be fined or imprisoned for letting a youth step foot in their premises during curfew hours., This study examined victim reports and juvenile arrests for the year before and the year after the law was enacted on June 1, l994.  Data were examined on a week-by-week basis which allowed researchers to remove any overall trends that might be occurring independent of the law (e.g., to separate out the impact of the law from any long term trends over the period being studied)., The findings were clear. “The implementation of the curfew law did not significantly reduce victimizations, juvenile victimizations nor juvenile arrests during curfew hours” (p. 212).  There were, however, some immediate and relatively short term effects of the curfew law.  For example, violent victimizations during curfew hours decreased when the law came in, but returned to their pre-curfew level when curfew enforcement decreased.  “Property victimizations of people of all ages during curfew hours increased significantly after the curfew law took effect.”  Juvenile arrests were not affected by the change in the law. The “changes in victimization [e.g., decreased violent victimization] during curfew hours are abrupt and mainly temporary while effects during non-curfew hours [e.g., violent victimizations] tended to be gradual and permanent” (p. 218)., Conclusion:  This study confirms the findings of an earlier study (See Highlights, Volume 3, Number 2).  “Juvenile curfew laws are ineffective for reducing crime because they do not include many of the perpetrators of crime, namely older adolescents and young adults; they do not include the hours when juveniles are most likely to commit offences; they are based on the incorrect assumption that police crackdowns reduce crime; and they do not fully utilize the theories and research concerning juvenile delinquency.  Finally they do not alter substantially the major correlates of delinquency: exposure to delinquent peers, schools, and the family.  Delinquent behaviour does not happen in isolation, but in a social context consisting of an individual’s peers, school, and family” (p. 226).  “Delinquency will not be reduced by forcing children into negative family situations marked by rejection, negative community patterns, excessively lax or severe supervision and discipline, criminal family members, and abuse.

"Allowing jurors to discuss evidence before the beginning of formal deliberations appears to have no harmful effects on the civil trial process.  In particular, it does not increase the likelihood that the jury will arrive at a verdict different from that which the judge would hand down.",", Background:  Most common law jurisdictions do not allow jurors to discuss evidence amongst themselves until formal deliberations have begun.  This practice is based on the theory that during a trial jurors “passively absorb all of the evidence and law presented to them... without making any judgments about it until told to do so by the judge” (p.361). The difficulty with this theory is that it is almost certainly wrong.  Jurors appear to take an active approach, constructing “stories or narratives from the trial evidence” (p. 362) so as to create coherent accounts of what occurred. It appears from the evidence that deliberations serve as “a valuable corrective to idiosyncrasy and error” (p.362) on the part of individual jurors., This study, with civil juries in Arizona, investigated the benefits and drawbacks of allowing pre-deliberation discussion of the evidence. In 161 cases, jurors were randomly assigned by judges either to the “standard” (no discussions before formal deliberations) condition or were told that they could discuss evidence before formal deliberations., The findings of the experiment suggest that there would be little harm in allowing jurors to discuss the evidence as it is presented:, Conclusion.  Jurors who are allowed to discuss evidence see this as useful. It does not seem to affect the verdicts (as measured by judge-jury disagreements).  “The results... fulfill neither the fondest hopes nor the worst nightmares of supporters and critics of the trial discussions jury reform” (p. 379)., Reference: Hannaford, Paula L., Valerie P.

"If concerted efforts are made to reduce prison populations, it can be done.  By implementing a series of policies designed to accomplish this, Finland was able to reduce its prison population by over 70%.","Background.  In the early 1950s, Finland’s incarceration rate was about 190 per 100,000 inhabitants, about four times the rate of the other Nordic countries.  Policy debates that started at that time rejected both repressive policies and “treatment” ideologies that helped support high incarceration rates.  These were replaced with a policy of “general prevention.”  This policy is very different from “deterrence” in that the idea of general prevention is to focus on the moral-creating and value-shaping effect of punishment and to aim for the internalization of the values implicit in the laws.  Hence the purpose of the criminal law is to influence value systems of people such that they refrain from illegal behaviour not because they might experience punishing consequences if apprehended, but because the behaviour itself is regarded as blameworthy (p.28)., The reduction of the Finnish prison population appears to have come about as a result of a conscious, long-term, and systematic criminal policy that was supported by the judiciary. (p.37). The policy was designed largely by experts who had “close personal and professional contacts with senior politicians...  Crime control has never been a central political issue in Finland” (p. 37).   Furthermore, “the media have retained a fairly sober and reasonable attitude toward issues of criminal policy” (p. 38). Like Canada, Finland has a relatively low crime rate. However, these changes were accomplished at a time when reported crime was increasing (in Finland and in the other Nordic countries). The elements of the policy shift appear to be the following:
Cost-benefit analysis was made part of criminal justice policy thinking.  “The role of punishment came to be seen as relative” (p.29).  Benefits of criminal justice approaches to crime control were compared with the benefits of other approaches.
The courts themselves appeared to shift away from the use of prison sentences, generally,  and toward shorter sentences in those instances when imprisonment was ordered.  These changes were consistent with those in the Nordic countries which Finland compared itself to. 
The legislature endorsed the view that prison was not necessarily the best criminal justice policy. The most important change was that the legislature gave the courts in 1977 “general guidance” in handing down punishments for all offences.  This general guidance has been described as constituting “a coherent and consistent unity with clear aims and systematic strategy” (p. 32). 
Community service was implemented (in practice and in legislation) and a form of “conditional sentences” reduced the use of short stays in prison. 
Special, more lenient, sentencing rules were developed for young offenders., Conclusion.  Finland achieved the imprisonment rate it wanted through a series of “expert driven” but broadly accepted reforms over a number of decades. No single factor appears responsible for the dramatic drop in the use of imprisonment, but it was probably necessary to have a sympathetic criminal justice climate and to have a coherent theory that, among other things, focused on costs and benefits of different policies., Reference: Lappi-Seppälä, Tapio.  The fall in the Finnish prison population.  Journal of Scandinavian Studies in Criminology and Crime Prevention, 2000, 1,  27-40., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV3N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-3-no-5-%E2%80%93-december-2000,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 3, No. 5 – December 2000",Regular Issue,2000
Drug courts may increase the likelihood of recidivism on drug charges and on non-drug charges.  These unfortunate effects may be caused by characteristics of the drug court themselves rather than the treatment that is supposed to flow from the drug court experience.,", Background. Drug courts evolved out of a concern that neither formal criminal justice processing nor voluntary treatment appeared to address drug offending. In the U.S., support for drug courts came in part from the realization that a high proportion of both state and federal prison populations are drug offenders.  In addition, drug offenders in many states, and under federal law, are often subject to very long (and expensive) terms of imprisonment., Drug courts are sometimes structured in such a manner that defendants are “constantly reminded of their deviant act and face disapproval from the judge, who chastises and condemns their drug use and lawbreaking behaviour. However, this ‘shaming’ experience is complemented by efforts to reintegrate the defendant back into society” (p. 524).  The empirical question, then, is whether this process is more stigmatizing than reintegrative and, therefore, whether it reduces or increases drug use. The evaluations of drug courts have yielded “mixed results about their effectiveness” (p. 527) in part, perhaps, because proper comparison groups have often not been used., This study examined the Las Vegas drug court which is patterned after Miami’s drug court, one of the oldest in the U.S.A.  It compared all 301 offenders who had gone through the drug court in 1995 to a sample of non-drug-court offenders who had similar drug charges.  Recidivism in 1997 was examined since some of the offenders were under criminal justice control (jail or probation) in 1996 as a result of their 1995 charges. Statistical methods were used to “control for” pre-existing differences between the two groups., The results were not encouraging. “Drug court participants had substantially higher recidivism risks than non-drug [ordinary] court participants.  Overall, drug court participants had a recidivism rate of 26% compared to the non-drug court participants’ rate of 16%.  This findings “is generally maintained across different types of offenders and drug charges” (p. 535).  These results hold when one looks at recidivism for drug charges as well as non-drug charges., Conclusion.  Just because drug courts are new and different and appear to be based on a [coerced] “treatment” model does not mean that they work.  The problem seemed to be “that the drug court was far more stigmatizing than reintegrative in its orientation toward offenders” (p. 536). Offenders who go to drug courts are under intensive criminal justice supervision for longer periods of time than are non-drug court offenders. However, this court “fails to continue reintegrative efforts once the individual has graduated” (p. 537). As the authors point out, “By moving from a rigid and highly structured environment to a potentially chaotic and unstable environment in a matter of weeks, it should not be surprising that drug court graduates experience high rates of relapse and recidivism” (p. 537)., Reference: Miethe, Terance D., Hong Lu, and Erin Reese.  Reintegrative shaming and recidivism risks in drug court: Explanations for some unexpected findings.

"The link between youth violence and the family can be affected by public policy. Alleviating the effects of poverty on the family, for example, can reduce the risk of youth violence.",", Background: In the U.S., as in Canada, there is no conclusive evidence that youth violence (in schools or in society generally) is increasing.  In fact, the increase in homicides attributed to youths that occurred in the U.S. during the period 1985-1993, and the decline thereafter, were largely due to changes in homicides with firearms., Family dysfunction is important in understanding violence.  Whether it is due to exposure to violence within the family, biological factors (e.g., prenatal effects of alcohol), untreated mental health problems, or “negative” parenting, the family is a site where intervention can have positive impacts.  Parents who are hostile to their children, for example, appear to be more likely to have aggressive children. Furthermore “engagement in school is a strong protective factor against anti-social behaviour, and positive family relationships are predictive of school engagement” (p. 34). “Children from homes characterized by negative parenting were at risk for problems regardless of their ethnicity or income and regardless of whether their parents were married, divorced, single, or remarried” (p.35). “Parental engagement in their children’s lives is one of the most important... contributors to children’s healthy psychological development” (p.36)., Negative parenting, however, is, to some extent, a result of social policy. “By far, the most insidious cause of negative parenting is poverty.  Economic stress... increases the risk for negative parenting, which in turn increases the risk for youthful violence” (p.36).  “Parents under stress, because of deteriorating housing, inadequate childcare [and]... terrible schools... cannot parent as effectively as those who live under more benign conditions” (p. 36).    These are, however, “risk factors for the development of youthful violence, but they are not infallible predictors... The majority of those who have aggressive, hostile, or disengaged parents are not violent... [Thus] attempts to identify potentially violent young people before they have committed acts of violence will prove unsuccessful.  The vast majority of children we would identify as potentially violent on the basis of background factors will never commit an act of violence, and, consequently many youngsters would be unfairly stigmatized under any such screening system.”, Conclusion:  Interventions designed to improve the state of the family can have direct beneficial impacts on families and also reduce levels of violence of children growing up in these households.  Hence, public health approaches, which would help reduce the stresses experienced by all families, are much more likely to have a substantial impact on youth violence than programs that target individual violent children. “Any attempt to reduce youth violence... must include a systematic effort to improve the home environments of... children and adolescents and, in particular, to engage... parents in the business of parenting....  We can do this by improving prenatal care, expanding parent education, and promoting family friendly policies that reduce poverty, prevent and treat mental health and substance abuse problems, and enhance parental effectiveness” (p.38)., Reference: Steinberg, Laurence.  Youth violence: Do parents and families make a difference?  National Institute of Justice Journal, April 2000, 31-38., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV3N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-3-no-5-%E2%80%93-december-2000,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 3, No. 5 – December 2000",Regular Issue,2000
"Tough criminal justice policies in recent decades in the USA and the UK are the result of changes in the way in which crime is experienced, particularly by the “liberal elite.”",", Background.  Over the past 40 years, strategies of crime control have changed in many countries (e.g., the UK and the USA) as a result of the perceived inability of penal-welfare policies to deliver adequate levels of security.  The result has been a shift to two distinct lines of government action: enhanced control and expressive punishment (“punitive segregation”) on the one hand, and the “withdrawal of the state’s claim to be the chief provider of security” in favour of a strategy of prevention and partnership on the other (p. 348).  “The new penal ideal is that the public be protected and its sentiments expressed” (p. 350)., The experience of crime has changed in recent decades. In the past 30 years, it is the experience of crime by the “liberal elites” that has changed most dramatically.  This group has shifted from being the strongest supporters of “welfarist and correctionalist objectives” in the 1950s to being strong supporters of these new approaches.  The middle class has, historically, been insulated from the problems of crime.  In the 1960s, however,  “crime became a prominent fact of life” for the middle class (p. 359). Work and family patterns have changed such that “crime has become one of the threats that the contemporary middle class household must take seriously” (p. 362). A crime control deficit was identified and was perceived as a threat to those who previously were not affected directly by crime. The mass media, and TV in particular, have institutionalized the experience of crime by providing us with “regular, everyday occasions in which to play out the emotions of fear, anger, resentment and fascination that crime provokes” (p.363)., The results of these changes are that we have developed a “repertoire of private security arrangements.” Daily routines have changed,  especially for those who can afford to change, in the face of a society that is perceived to have changed.  We have, then, a distinct cluster of beliefs around crime which include high crime rates, highly politicized and emotive representations of crime, and the perception of state inadequacy.  Crime becomes part of daily consciousness for the middle class that previously lived lives that were insulated from crime.  Support for ‘understanding’ the offender is replaced with condemnation of offenders.  Reintegration of offenders is perceived as less realistic or morally compelling (p. 368)., Conclusion.  The experience of crime – largely through the media – by the “liberal elite,” has changed the way in which governments view and respond to crime. “The new strategies [in response to crime] – expressivity, punitiveness, victim-centredness, public protection, exclusion, enhanced control, loss-prevention, public-private partnership, responsibilization -- are grounded in a new collective experience from which they draw their meaning and their strength.”  They are also rooted in a “reactionary current of culture and politics that characterizes the present in terms of moral breakdown, incivility, and the decline of the family...”  These patterns differ across countries, but they have similar origins and appear to persist even when governments change., Reference: Garland, David.  The culture of high crime societies: Some preconditions of recent ‘law and order’ policies.  British Journal of Criminology, 2000, 40, 347-375., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV3N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-3-no-5-%E2%80%93-december-2000,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 3, No. 5 – December 2000",Regular Issue,2000
"Most of the “promises” associated with placing young offenders in the adult criminal justice system are false.  In fact, transferring youth to the adult system may, among other things,  increase their subsequent criminality.",", Background. The ability of judges to transfer youths charged with offences to adult court has always been part of most US states’ juvenile justice laws. More recently, however, many state legislatures have required certain categories of youth to be tried and sentenced in adult court or have given control over to prosecutors. The result is that it is estimated that over 200,000 youths are prosecuted in America’s adult courts (p.97). [Canada typically transfers fewer than 100 youths per year to adult court.]  “For all offence types, all age categories, and all years, black youths were more likely to be waived [transferred] to [adult] criminal court than their white counterparts” (p. 102). More than half of the transferred youths receive harsher sentences than they would have in juvenile courts, the others apparently receiving sentences more or less in the range they would have received in juvenile court (p.114). Transferred youths are typically put in the normal adult prisons without programs designed for youths (p.123)., The effects of the transfer of these youths are just beginning to be understood and generally do not support the conclusion that treating young offenders as adults is a good strategy.  Among the findings are the following:, Conclusion.  Transfer of youths to the adult criminal justice system “appears to be counterproductive: transferred youths are more likely to reoffend, and to reoffend more quickly and more often than those retained in the juvenile justice system” (p. 149).  These effects may be caused by the more “caring” attitude of those in the juvenile system and/or the impact of the programs used in youth facilities, some of which have been shown to be effective. Making it easier or automatic to transfer youths to adult court does not act as a deterrent to crime., Reference: Bishop, Donna M. Juvenile offenders in the adult criminal justice system.

"Women who call the police in cases of wife assault do not necessarily want their abuser arrested.  Their decisions to invoke the law are part of a process in which they negotiate their own safety and that of their children. Thus, they are active agents who make decisions about the most effective response to their situation. As a result, intervention in these cases – legal and otherwise – needs to be perceived as a process instead of a single event that encompasses brief or sporadic contact between these women and the criminal justice system.",", Background. Since the early 1970s when public awareness grew about the problem of domestic violence in our society, a number of legislative and policy changes have been implemented to improve legal responses to these crimes. What is striking about much of the research that examined the effects of these changes is the absence of the main actors’ voices – the women who experience the violence. When women have been asked about their satisfaction with legal interventions, the primary research focus has been on the outcome of the intervention. It is often the case, however, that when the outcome is viewed as negative by those who engage the law, the entire process is automatically deemed to be negative as well. This precludes the recognition that women’s use of the law may be prompted by various concerns and objectives, only one of which is the arrest of their abuser., The Research. Two studies address the neglected question of why abused women invoke the law, focusing on them as active agents rather than passive victims. Landau showed that a large group of women (40%) did not have arrest on their minds when they called the police (p. 147). Rather, both studies indicated that women reported a variety of reasons for calling the police, ranging from protection (warning the abuser against further violence, removing the abuser from the home or helping the woman leave safely) and prevention (deterrence through charging) to rehabilitation (medical or psychiatric care for the abuser or counseling for, both parties). Their interest in protection, prevention and rehabilitation generally did not include a desire for their abuser to be punished. Instead, Lewis et al. suggest that these women are engaging in a “process of negotiating their own and their children’s safety during which they make decisions based on judgements about the more effective responses” (p. 191). In addition, Landau indicated that “many (women) wanted to work together on changes in their relationship that would put an end to the violence and keep the family intact” (p. 150). Criminal prosecution was perceived as a threat to this end., Conclusion. This research demonstrates that abused women want protection and deterrence in conjunction with rehabilitation of the abuser. This cannot be provided by legal intervention alone. Future research and policy should consider how sets of interventions – legal structures, social welfare services and support of informal networks and communities – can work simultaneously to provide a unified, effective response to men’s violence against women., References.

"The question is not whether we should have DNA databanks.  The question is whether massive expansion of DNA databanks will be cost effective for apprehending offenders.  At this point, the answer appears to be “No”: massive DNA databanks do not constitute a cost effective place to invest scarce criminal justice funds.",", Background: DNA data banks, like fingerprints,  are here to stay. Will widespread collection of DNA samples for these banks turn out to be the most effective way of apprehending and prosecuting offenders?   Like police helicopters, DNA databases have contributed to some spectacular successes in apprehending offenders.  The argument that “one life saved” justifies such tools ignores, of course, the possibility that two or more lives could be saved through investment of similar amounts of money in something else. The justification for creating DNA databases is that DNA collected at the crime scene will help increase the number of “cold hits” – where a suspect is identified purely on the basis of the DNA.  This is a completely different matter from using DNA collected at the crime scene to link an identified suspect with a crime., The limits on DNA databanks have to do with efficiency rather than effectiveness:
To get a “hit”, DNA needs to be collected at the crime scene.  Although some have suggested that it is likely that there are DNA traces (hair, skin flakes, etc.) at some or most crime scenes, it is unlikely that police will have the resources or the motivation to search in most cases. DNA “mining” therefore will not have much impact in solving most crimes. 
At present, if a sample is found at a crime scene, the cost in the USA to create a profile is about $50.  Although this number is likely to be reduced over time, it means that a substantial amount of money is needed to collect the data, and even more to create a workable computer system to make such data accessible.  [Canada’s experience in various areas demonstrates the unpredictability of costs of such databases.]
The effectiveness of databases in creating “cold hits” increases with the size of the database, yet the marginal utility of increasing the size or scope of the database decreases as one moves from “known serious offenders” toward capturing the DNA from “all” offenders or suspects., There are also other concerns, among them the use of DNA databases for civil purposes (e.g., screening for insurance acceptability).  Given privacy concerns that exist in most western countries, laws in some U.S. states that allow the collection of DNA from anyone arrested for offences as minor as a common assault are problematic in terms of effectiveness, and worrisome in terms of their collateral impacts., Conclusion: Beyond the use of DNA testing for “known suspect testing” and “post-conviction relief”  from a false conviction, this paper suggests that “the spreading craze over DNA databases as a crime control measure”  does not deserve similar support (p. 686). DNA databases do not, at this point, appear to be “the most effective way to spend scarce criminal justice resources” (p. 688).  As people realize that DNA databases are both “expansive” and “expensive,” it is possible that “there will be much greater scrutiny accorded to the supposed benefits which many law enforcement and other elected officials are quick to claim but slow to demonstrate” (p. 690)., Reference: Tracy, Paul E. and Vincent Morgan.  Big Brother and his science kit: DNA databases for 21st century crime control?  Journal of Criminal Law & Criminology, 2000, 90, 635-690., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV3N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-3-no-5-%E2%80%93-december-2000,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 3, No. 5 – December 2000",Regular Issue,2000
"Judges, like anyone else, can be affected by election year rhetoric.  A US federal district judge reversed his own controversial decision in a 1996 drug case as a result, apparently, of pressure from, among other people, President Clinton who had appointed him. Even judges who are not directly accountable to an electorate can be affected by electoral politics.",", Background:  In January 1996, a federal district judge in New York, Harold Baer, ruled that incriminating evidence in a drug case should be excluded because the police had conducted an unlawful search and seizure.  In his original decision, the judge had ruled that the police officers who had stopped the defendant, Carol Bayless, had no reasonable suspicion that she had been involved in a crime.  Furthermore, the judge indicated that on some key issues, he did not believe the arresting officer.  Since the only incriminating evidence came from this search, the drug possession charge was thrown out.   Not surprisingly, the judge was criticized, in particular, for his statements concerning the police officer.  Much of the criticism came from William “Broken Windows” Bratton, then New York’s Commissioner of Police who indicated that Judge Baer should no longer hear cases involving police officers. Nor was it terribly surprising that presidential candidate Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich referred to the judge’s attitude as “pro-drug-dealer, pro-crime, anti-police, and anti-law enforcement” (p. 30). More surprising was the criticism from Democratic politicians (e.g., New York’s Democratic Senator Moynihan) who had originally recommended the judge for office. Since it was an election year, the Clinton administration joined the Republicans in criticizing Judge Baer.   The judge granted a hearing to hear “new” evidence. Judge Baer reversed his ruling and, in effect, apologized to the police for his statements.  The legal community’s concern was that the federal judge had caved to political pressure., What can be said about the nature of the pressure to change the decision? Baer was appointed by a democratic president, Clinton.  The argument was that such appointees are “soft on crime.” It turns out that, in fact, like most of Clinton’s appointees, Baer almost always ruled against defendants in criminal cases.  This was his only pro-defendant ruling in a criminal case.  Generally speaking, in New York, judges appointed by Democrats are no more likely than judges appointed by Republicans to decide in favour of defendants in criminal matters. In other words, there was no evidence to support the assertion that this judge was really any different from any other judge.  And his reversal appeared to raise more legal questions than his original ruling., Conclusion: Obviously, this is only one case.  But the reversal appears to have been brought about by public pressure from exactly those people whom one might have thought would have defended the judge and highlighted the importance of judicial independence.  The fact that it was announced that “if the Bayless ruling was not reversed, the President might ask for [the judge’s] resignation” suggests that the importance of an independent judiciary pales in comparison to election year politics. Can we expect better behaviour from our own politicians?  Are judges in Canada better insulated from these kinds of pressures than their American counterparts?, Reference: Segal, Jennifer A.

"The number of youths killed by gun violence in schools is about half the number of Americans killed annually as a result of being struck by lightning.  Yet the media are creating the impression of a “crisis” and politicians are responding with “tough” crime control measures.  The “tough” measures are totally unwarranted because students are actually safe, and feel safe, at school.","The Context. In the past year the news media have been reporting lethal violence in American schools giving the impression that there is a “crisis” of classroom violence.  Without putting the isolated idiosyncratic events in context, the public’s fears of violence and school safety for their children are intensified.  The politicians have reacted by proposing “solutions” such as increasing the number of police in school, eliminating or lowering the age at which youth can be tried as adults and expanding the death penalty to juveniles., Violence in Schools in Context.  The authors examined data from a variety of sources and always came to the same conclusion: lethal violence in school is rare.  Similar to the past six years, in 1997-8 there were 40 shooting deaths in US schools.  That number is, however, an overestimation because the data included any deaths that occurred near, or on the way to school.  Thus any deaths (suicides or homicides) of children or adults, committed by children or adults, were included.  The authors estimated the rate of juveniles murdered outside of school to be 40 times higher than the rate of murders in school.  The authors concluded that “the number of children killed by gun violence in schools is about half the number of Americans killed annually by lightning strikes” (pg. 2)., The authors also reported results from victimization surveys administered to students between 1989-1995, which found that there was a 0.1% increase in overall victimization.  During that same time period however, the US saw significant increases in the rate of juvenile arrests for serious violence.  The authors also examined “violence related” hospital emergency admissions.  Only about 6% were said to have occurred at school.  In contrast, 48% of the injuries occurred at home, 29% at work and 15% on the streets.  Moreover, in a self-report survey in 1993, roughly 90% of students surveyed said that they felt “safe” or “very safe” at school., Implications. Even though there are relatively low levels of lethal violence perpetrated in schools, and even though students appear to feel safe in schools, the response to the media “hype” about the “violence” crisis has been to cut after-school programs, put police officers in schools, expel students for minor acts of violence and try youth as adults. We see similar trends occurring in Canada with the development of “zero-tolerance” policies which mandate that students be expelled, suspended or criminally charged for any act of violence. Not only are such measures unwarranted, but they also appear to have little impact on violence., If one is really interested in reducing youth violence, thought should be given to expanding after-hours programs in schools.  The after school hours between 3:00pm and 8:00pm appear to be the “peak” juvenile crime hours.  Thus, programs which occupy children during those times appear to be the most cost-effective means to control and prevent delinquency.  Studies have found that “recreational programs which aggressively recruit youth and sustain participation in their programs hold excellent potential to prevent juvenile delinquency within the community” (pg. 10)., Reference: Donohue, E., Schiraldi, V. & Ziedenberg, J.

"When can “intermediate sanctions” reduce recidivism? When they target the specific needs of an offender that relate to crime (e.g., drug dependence) and when they are implemented well and with sufficient intensity.  “Intermediate sanctions” are no more a quick fix to crime than are the prison sentences they replace.",", Context.  “Intermediate sanctions” can be used as enhanced forms of probation or parole or as an alternative to imprisonment.  Generally, the popularity of intermediate sanctions relates to their ability to hold offenders accountable without the cost and negative effects of prison. Their use, therefore, is typically not justified on the basis that they aid in the offenders’ rehabilitation.  Nevertheless, some make claims that intermediate sanctions actually achieve a rehabilitative goal which prisons or other sanctions do not.  In this article, the author reviews three types of intermediate sanctions – aftercare programs, alternatives to custody and boot camps – in order to understand how best to design effective “intermediate” programs., Many evaluations of aftercare programs did not find any differences between those who participated in the program on release from prison and comparable groups who did not. When reviewing why they have no effect, it appears that there are two reasons:
The aftercare programs are generally not well implemented.  For example, offenders usually only receive general support as opposed to support that targets specific problems and risk factors (e.g.,  dealing with drug abuse, unemployment, etc.).  
Many of the programs focus first and foremost on control and surveillance.  Addressing specific problems (e.g.,  drug dependence) is not seen as particularly important.  Programs which focus mainly on control and surveillance of the offender are not as effective as programs that incorporate treatment and rehabilitation., The same problems emerge when examining alternatives to custody.  Generally, many of the programs have been poorly conceptualized and implemented.  There are no clear goals of what the program should achieve and the specific type of offender that is supposed to benefit most from the program is not identified., In reviewing boot camps, it appeared that the “prison” phase of the program has no effect on recidivism.  In fact, there is evidence that offenders who are put through the prison phase actually do worse then others who do not go through the prison phase (i.e. higher recidivism, etc.).  Boot camps that devoted time to treatment programming (i.e. education, substance abuse, etc.) showed the most promise.  However, this needed to be followed by intensive supervision and aftercare support.  Once released into the community, offenders benefited from quality support services such as education, employment and counseling., Conclusion. There are no “quick fixes”.  Thus, “one-size fits all” type of programming -- whether it involves prison or non-prison sanctions -- will not work.  Programs that have the main focus of control and surveillance do not appear to be effective in terms of lowering recidivism rates.  To be effective, quality treatment which targets specific problems needs to be part of the program.  Moreover, the specific offender who is to benefit from a particular program needs to be identified.  Clear goals of the program should also be outlined.  The proper -- and sufficient -- implementation of the program is crucial., Reference:  Altschuler, D.M.

"Youth violence can be prevented.  Early intervention -- focusing on intensive early childhood education and family support for urban, low income family -- tends to be effective in addressing  long term chronic violence.  Programs focusing on youth in schools, gangs, and the community generally tend to reduce “adolescent limited violence.”",", Context.  “Knowledge of the factors that increase risk for violence can help define populations that should receive preventive interventions...” (p. 263).   Some risk factors cannot be changed through interventions,  but there are “protective processes that mediate or moderate effects of risk exposure, promote resilience in children, and prevent health and behaviour problems” (p. 263).  Two groups of violent youth need to be differentiated so that different types of interventions can be provided:
“Life-course persistent” offenders. They show an early onset of troublesome and aggressive behaviours. They usually begin to engage in delinquency at a young age (age 10) and continue offending in their adult years
“Adolescent-limited” offenders. They do not have a history of troublesome behaviours in early childhood.  In the teenage years they begin offending when situations and opportunities present themselves.  Usually, however, they will obey and conform to school and family rules and begin to naturally desist from crime around the age of 18.  The increase in youth violence in the late 1980s and early 1990s appeared to be a result of an increase in the numbers of this type of violent offender, not of an increase in “life-course-persistent” offenders (p. 273). In other words there was a “spread” in violence rather than a “deepening” in violence., Interventions for life-course persistent offenders.  Interventions must occur early in life if life-course persistent offenders are to benefit.  Targeting impoverished areas and providing prenatal care decrease the risk of complications during birth.  Following the prenatal care, it is important to provide home visits by health professionals in order to help foster positive parent-child attachment and teach parents how to control and manage the child.  Because poor parent-child attachment and inconsistent or punitive parenting are strong predictors of later problem behaviour, it is not surprising that training parents how to positively manage young children’s has been found to reduce delinquency.  Teaching school teachers to control problem behaviours has also been effective in reducing aggressive behaviours in the classroom. It is crucial that children develop a sense of attachment and commitment to school. In that respect, it is important to treat cognitive deficits so that problems do not develop further., Interventions to prevent the spread of violence.  Violence has a contagious element to it.  It appears to spread in social contexts where young people interact:  peer groups, school, and youth gangs. The focus, in other words, is simply to stop “natural” peer influences from creating a larger number of violent youths. Typical effective programs are those that teach skills related to “anger management, impulse control, and empathy” (p. 292), or which involve after school recreation programs (p. 294)., Conclusion: There is no “one size fits all” solution to youth violence. Different types of interventions will be effective with the two types of violent youth. Early social interventions can effectively address “life course persistent”  violent youth. Programs that target adolescents in their everyday settings address can be effective with “adolescent-limited” offenders., Reference: Howell, J.C. & Hawkins, J.D.

"School is consistently found to be an important factor that helps youth maintain resilience to delinquency and drug abuse. The importance of encouraging and helping youth to become involved in, and committed to school should not underestimated.",", Context. It is well established that there are family and environmental factors which place youth “at risk” of engaging in delinquency and drug use.  However, up to 50% of children identified as being at high “risk” to engage in such behaviours, never do.  Thus, researchers have started investigating why some extremely disadvantaged children are resilient to delinquency.  Attempts are being made to identify “protective” factors which promote resilience to delinquency.  Protective factors are not merely the absence of risk factors because they have an impact on behaviour once risk is established.  Thus, protective factors differentiate youth who face relatively high levels of risk but do not acquire the undesirable attribute – in this case, delinquency., This Study investigated protective factors for delinquency and drug use. Although delinquency and drug use are related, they are not the same – most notably, drug abuse usually has a later onset than delinquency.  Over 700 youth were interviewed every 6 months for 4 years – from grades 7 and 8 to grades 11 and 12.  Males from high crime areas were over-sampled to create a sample of “high-risk” youth. The youths were asked about their involvement in delinquency and drug use.  Information was also gathered about the presence of various risk factors (low household income, single parent family, drug use within the family, child placed in foster care, etc.).  Finally, each youth was asked about the presence of various “protective” factors (strong family attachment, strong academic ability, commitment to school, involvement with “law-abiding” peers, high self-esteem, etc.)., The Results: Over 60% of the high-risk adolescents were resilient – i.e. they resisted delinquency and drug abuse.  However, the more risk factors a child had, the more likely he or she was to be involved in delinquency and drug abuse.  High-risk youth who were resilient to delinquency and drug abuse had more protective factors than the high-risk youth who were not resilient.  Educational factors consistently distinguished resilient youth from non-resilient youth.  Those youth who were good at school, valued school, and who reported having positive interactions with teachers were more likely to be resilient to delinquency and drug abuse.  Strong parental attachment was also an important protective factor.  While early protective factors continued to affect resilience to drug use over the long term, the same was not true for delinquency.  Protective factors only exerted an influence in the short term.  As time went on youth appeared naturally to become more resilient to delinquency., Conclusions: The importance of encouraging and helping youth become involved in, and committed to school should not be underestimated.  School was consistently an important protective factor for both delinquency and drug abuse.  This highlights the significant positive role school plays in adolescents’ lives. Since youth appear, naturally, to become resilient over time, focus should be on developing attachments to school early on.  Evidence from this study suggests that developing such an attachment early on would also have an effect in preventing drug abuse much later on in life., Reference: Smith, C., Lizotte, A.J., & Thornberry, T.P.

"Spousal homicides may be different from other homicides, but they do not constitute a homogeneous category. Men who are killed by their female partners almost always precipitated the violence by first abusing them, whereas female victims of violence from their male partners is rarely preceded by violence from the female victim. The type of relationship a female murder victim had with her male partner is also important. For example, boyfriends who kill their intimate partners are more likely to have an officially recorded history of violence than are married or common-law males who kill their spouses.",", Context. The type of relationship between a victim and an offender, and their genders, are critical if one wants to understand homicides. It has long been recognized that intimate relationships are more prone to lethal violence than other relationships.  As a result, intimate homicides generally, and lethal violence against women in particular, have often been studied separately and treated as a homogenous phenomenon., The first study explores the context in which a homicide takes place, looking at all 108 partner homicides in North Carolina in 1989.   Victim precipitation or the idea that homicide victims sometimes participate in the actions leading to their deaths (p. 403) turns out to be especially important when looking at spousal homicides involving male victims. 75% of the incidents involving male victims appeared to be victim precipitated (typically by violence from the male directed at the female). None of the female victim events were precipitated by such behaviour from the victim., Five themes are identified in these killings: (1) these acts are often the final outcome of chronic women battering (p. 411); (2) battered women are in danger when they remain with their abusers, when they attempt to leave the relationship, and after they have left (p. 412); (3) existing protective measures for battered women are not reliable guarantees of their safety (p.413); (4) domestic violence is not always private violence as it often occurs in front of others or it is known about (p. 413); and (5) use of alcohol by males and the availability of guns are significant correlates of partner homicide (p.414)., The second study demonstrates that relationship state (whether or not the couple is separated) and relationship status (whether the couple is legally married, living common-law or dating) are also important concepts if one is interested in understanding the killing of women by current or former male partners. This study examines 703 cases of intimate femicide that took place in Ontario, 1974-1994., The results demonstrate that offenders who kill common-law partners or girlfriends are likely to be younger, more likely to have a criminal record, and less likely to have children than offenders who were legally married to their victims.  Moreover, in contrast to legally-married offenders, common-law partners were more likely to be unemployed. In addition, boyfriends were more likely to kill their victims in public and to have a known history of violent behavior., Conclusion. The gender of the victim and the role of ongoing male physical and psychological aggression, the predominance of alcohol use, and the role of gun availability are important in understanding spousal homicides.  Policies related to intervention and prevention should focus on these reoccurring situational factors.  But there are important differences in cases of lethal violence among intimates which are often obscured by crude measures of victim-offender relationship.  If we were able to understand why particular groups are high risk and at which points during estrangement women may be at greatest risk (e.g., some research has indicated that risk is greatest immediately after separation and diminishes with time), then interventions and resources could be targeted more effectively., References.

"A multimedia campaign to inform the public about crime and crime control did not educate the public, nor did it alter their fear of crime.  However, the campaign did manage to make people evaluate the criminal justice system more positively.  This demonstrates that educating the public about crime and crime control is a complex process.  One cannot simply give people an extensive amount of non-specific information and expect changes in attitudes or behaviours.",", The Context.  The criminal justice system needs the support of the public in order to function adequately.  However, most people appear to be ill-informed about the limits of the criminal justice system – seeing it as “the solution” to crime.  People also have little knowledge of the way the law works, the types of sanctions offenders receive, etc.  Moreover, the public usually has inaccurate perceptions of crime rates.  Thus, the belief that the criminal justice system is the “solution” to crime coupled with insufficient information about the law has two unfortunate effects. First it creates resentment toward the system for not decreasing crime. Second, it can lead to apathy on the public’s part to engage in preventive behaviours., This study examined a program that sought to inform the public about the nature of crime and the criminal justice system. It had three goals.  First, by providing accurate information about the nature of crime, the designers of the program hoped to decrease the public’s level of fear.  Second, by providing information about the nature of crime and the role communities and individuals play in preventing crime, it was hypothesized that people would initiate prevention efforts.  Third, by providing information about the limited role the criminal justice system plays in reducing crime, it was hypothesized that people would develop more realistic expectations about the system and therefore would not be as negative in evaluations of the justice system., Two similar communities were chosen – one received information, the other did not. Information about crime and crime prevention was disseminated to individuals by police officers, over the radio and through two regional daily newspapers.  There were also community meetings, press releases, posters, etc. informing people about the campaign to increase knowledge of crime and the criminal justice system.  There was also a “crime prevention” van which gave out information about crime and crime prevention., Conclusion. The campaign was largely unsuccessful.  The results indicated that although the community that received the information was aware of the campaign, they were no more knowledgeable than the community that did not receive the information. There were no differences in knowledge of the criminal justice system or in fear of crime.  The only effect of the campaign was that people who received the information appeared to evaluate the criminal justice system more positively., These findings  demonstrate that educating the public about crime and crime control is a complex process.  One cannot simply give people an extensive amount of non-specific information and expect changes in attitudes or behaviours.  The public thinks about crime and crime control with a degree of sophistication which requires a thoughtful plan to educate., Reference: Kuttschreutter, M. & Weigman, O.

"It is estimated that one out of every 20 Americans will spend some time in prison, largely for drug-related crimes.  With the soaring cost of prisons in the US (38 billion dollars – an amount larger then the national budget of Switzerland), treatment for substance abuse appears to be a viable, cost-effective approach with long-term benefits.",", Context.  The United States has seen an enormous growth in prisons and prison populations over the past number of years. To put the financial burdens of sustaining the prisons in perspective, in 1996 the cost of building and operating state and federal prisons in the U.S. was 38 billion dollars – an amount larger then the national budget of Switzerland.  Between 1995 and 1996, Medicaid saw a 3.5% increase in funding while prisons received a 28% increase in funding.  It has been estimated that one out of every 20 Americans will spend some time in prison., How did this happen?  Public concern over violence and drugs prompted politicians to adopt a “war on drugs” approach which saw sentences increase and the implementation of mandatory sentences for the possession of some drugs like crack and cocaine.  However, drug offences are not the only time that substance abuse is associated with “crime”.  While the public perception is that the more “dangerous” drugs like crack and cocaine are closely associated with violent crime, alcohol is, in fact, more tightly coupled with violence.  For example, 21% of inmates in state prisons who were convicted of a violent crime admitted to being under the influence of alcohol when they committed their crime.  In contrast, only 3% of violent offenders were under the influence of crack or cocaine at the time of their crime.  The authors estimate that roughly “80% of the men and women behind bars – some 1.4 million individuals – are seriously involved with drug and alcohol abuse” (pg. 2).  While 75% of state inmates need treatment, only about 17% receive it., Not only has the “war on drugs” not been effective in reducing “crime” or dealing with the substance abuse associated with crime, it has also been extremely expensive when compared to various treatment approaches. For example, there is evidence that treatment interventions for heavy cocaine users would cost one-seventh that of law enforcement and would achieve the same reduction in cocaine consumption.  The authors estimate that comprehensive treatment would cost $6,500 per inmate.  If the individual remained crime free and employed, an annual benefit of $68,800 could be achieved because not only would the individual be working and obtaining an income, but there would be no arrest, prosecution, incarceration (roughly $19,600 per inmate per year), or health care costs.  Moreover, the authors note that “the success rate needed to break even is fairly modest: if just 10% of the inmates who are given one year of residential treatment stay sober and work during the first year after release, the investment is more then returned in economic benefits” (pg. 58)., So what can be done? There are no “quick fixes”.  Programs need to be well designed and implemented.  Providing aftercare in the community is critical.  Programs that phase an inmate into independent living, while allowing the individual to have contact with treatment staff has been shown to reduce post-release relapse and recidivism.  Providing educational and vocational training is also critical. Helping the offender reconnect with the community and develop ties is critical in maintaining a “crime-free” lifestyle. The authors also claim that the mandatory sentencing laws, which provide no chance of early release or parole, should be modified.  Eliminating any chance of early release also eliminates any incentive on the inmates’ part to participate in treatment.  Finally, non-violent substance abusers should be diverted into treatment – it saves money and has a better chance of reducing “crime”., Reference: Belenko, S. and Peugh, J.

Ordinary jurors can understand complex evidence at a trial. But it would help if certain basic techniques of good communication were applied to the presentation of evidence at trials.,", Context.  Concern about jurors’ abilities to understand complex evidence sometimes comes from prosecutors who have conducted  spectacular, but failed, prosecutions.  In the U.K., for example, the Home Office released a consultation paper in 1998 suggesting that non-jury trials should be considered for certain, as yet undefined, complex cases. However,  earlier research that showed that jurors did not understand or recall certain evidence did not examine whether they could be helped to understand and recall this evidence if issues surrounding comprehension were addressed (p. 764)., This paper reports the results of three studies using a representative sample of 207 adults who met the criteria for jury service in the U.K. Various measures of the quality of the reasoning used by the participants in the studies were examined. In addition, jurors were asked how difficult they found the presentation of the evidence to be., Results.  Most participants “did not use poor quality reasoning” (p. 768).  For example, on three different measures of jurors’ “quality of reasoning” no more than 10% used what were seen as poor reasoning.   On a fourth indicator -- the use of “weak or indirect considerations” (e.g., “it seems unfair to blame one person” [when it is clear that more than one were involved in the offence]) -- 25% of participants used poor reasoning.  Furthermore, depending on the criterion used, between 10% and 46% of participants reported some difficulty in understanding the evidence.  Repetition of key evidence, however, appeared to increase comprehension (p. 769).  It appeared that various techniques could also have been used to increase comprehension and adequate reasoning., Participants in the studies --  whether they had difficulties or not -- suggested that summaries of the evidence at key points and visual aids would have been helpful. It would also have been helpful if the court had summarized the evidence and put it in a coherent order. The authors note that “this last point is important because where jurors are simply presented with a list of information without clear structure...  this is likely to make it difficult for them to (a) retain it, and (b) interpret it meaningfully.”  In the absence of a “structure” on which to place the evidence, jurors “may impose their own -- possibly inappropriate or inaccurate -- structure (“story”) in order to interpret the evidence as it is being presented” (p. 771)., Conclusion.  The authors believe that 80% of their representative group of English adults were competent to serve on a major fraud trial.  Obviously some screening would increase this number, but better presentation techniques and “interactive pre-instruction” of jurors to establish key terms and ideas would also have been beneficial. When courts of appeal focus solely on whether the instructions to juries were “right” and ignore whether they could be understood correctly, it is inevitable that juror’s understanding will suffer. In other words, juror “performance” could be improved.  The only impediment is our failure to address this problem.   It should be noted that the authors did not speculate about, nor did they test,  the ability of ordinary judges to comprehend complex evidence and to come to a conclusion using adequate reasoning., Reference: Honess, R.

High levels of violence in the home are damaging in two ways:  Children experience psychological harm and they themselves become more violent.,"Governments, within Canada and elsewhere, have realized that violence against women is not only a difficult problem to address, but has a history of being neglected.  Also, because so much “family violence” is really violence perpetrated by men against their spouses, there is a tendency not to think of the potential for harmful effects on children whose live in violent homes., This study examined the lives of 3724 14-19 year olds in a number of Ohio and Colorado schools.  The youths reported, on an anonymous questionnaire administered in school, how much violence they experienced or witnessed at home.  Various measures of the psychological impact of these experiences were administered as well as a self-report measure of violence perpetrated by these same youths., The impact of exposure to violence (either as a victim or as an observer) was dramatic.  Youths, both girls and boys, responded to exposure to violence with adaptive strategies (e.g., talking to friends, getting more involved in school activities, joking), neutral strategies (crying, watching television), and maladaptive strategies (getting angry, saying mean things to others, and using drugs and alcohol). Consistent with other research, violence in the home led to more violence on the part of the children (both boys and girls)  who witnessed it., Effects of violence on the well-being of the children.  The youths were also administered a measure of “psychological trauma symptoms.”   There were very large differences on these measures, both for boys and for girls, between those who had experienced high vs. medium vs. low amounts of violence in the home.  For each symptom -- anger, anxiety, depression, dissociation, post-traumatic stress -- and for both boys and girls, those with high exposure to violence in the home reported more symptoms than did those with a medium level of exposure. Furthermore, those with medium levels of exposure to violence in the home showed more symptoms than those with low levels.  In other words, it is not just children who grow up in the most violent homes who would appear to suffer as a result of high levels of exposure. Even those whose homes are, relatively speaking, only moderately violent show negative impacts., Conclusion. It is probably well known that people who are violent come from violent homes.  This study replicates that finding.  However, it takes “violence in the home” one step further and shows that witnessing violence in the home has negative mental health impacts on children, even when that violence is at relatively moderate levels.  “Adolescents exposed to home violence are more likely than adolescents not so exposed to become angry, to say something mean to others, and/or to act aggressively toward others, all increasing their risk for future perpetration of violence” (p. 44)., Reference: Flannery, Daniel J., Mark Singer, Laura Williams, and Peter Castro.  Adolescent violence exposure and victimization at home: Coping and psychological trauma symptoms.  International Review of Victimology, 1998, 6, 29-48., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV2N3.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-2-no-3-%E2%80%93-april-1999,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 2, No. 3 – April 1999",Regular Issue,1999
"The way in which society punishes varies across time and place.  When societies create harsh penalties, they often create systems of “mercy” to counteract the harshness.   In the end, it may be just as important that the “punishment fit the time” as it is for the “punishment to fit the crime.”",", When Americans kill one another using firing squads, lethal injections, the electric chair, or gas chambers, there is seldom concern expressed about the means of imposing death. Concern is focused solely on whether death, by any means, is an appropriate penalty for the crime.  Yet when an American citizen was convicted of a crime in Singapore in 1994 and was sentenced to the lash – a penalty that was taken out of the Canadian Criminal Code only 25 years ago – it prompted moral outrage., We are reminded, in these selections, how quickly these kinds of concerns change.  In eighteenth century London, England,  public hangings were a “highly ritualized ‘cultural’ event” where the offender was paraded through the city before the actual hanging took place (p. 28).   Public hangings ended, in England, in part because it was felt that “the empathic experience of pain alone [from observing the offender being punished] signalled the wrong message because it failed to strike terror into the hearts of men, women, and children who watched” (p. 29).   More generally, what happened was the decline of physical punishments.  Not only did hangings become more private, but other punishments changed.  The pillory, for example, where offenders, whose heads and hands were locked by the device, and who were thus “rendered helpless in the face of missiles, taunts, and jeers from the crowd” lost favour at about the same time., Even whipping changed in its nature.  Whereas two hundred years ago, it was acceptable to impose a penalty of being “publicly whipped from the one End of Great George Street to the other”, its frequency was declining and today such a sentence would probably be seen,  even by the most “law and order” types amongst us, as being a little bit too brutal., The recently introduced Youth Criminal Justice Act contains a few new punishments in the menu now available to judges when punishing young offenders.  It is interesting that, in the search for new ways of punishing wrongdoers, that we typically do not look for “punishments of the body.”  The closest we come to such punishments, it would seem, is in the regimes associated with “boot camps” for youth.  But the “boot camp” punishments are seen as being “good” for the young person, and they are administered in private., Conclusion. These examples – public executions, whippings, the pillory, on the one hand, and the rise of the use of imprisonment on the other – demonstrate that “the specific forms of punishments are variable and change with the attitudes, sensibilities, and political and social objectives of the day” (p. 47).   But even when penalties are imposed, one must remember punishments are often modified and, therefore, “theories of mercy must take into account the peculiarities of time and place” (p. 10).  More importantly, “the history of modified punishment should also urge us to question policy-makers who see mercy as a possible way out, having painted themselves into a retributivist corner.  Because it is exercised through discretionary means, the modification of punishment can be arbitrary, unaccountable and unfair. Mercy can be inspired for all the wrong reasons…” (p. 17). There never have been “good old days” when, in a world similar to our own, offenders were punished quickly and harshly without some reflection and consideration given to individual circumstances in individual cases., Reference: Smith, Greg T. “Civilized people don’t want to see that kind of thing: The decline of public physical punishment in London, 1760-1840.”  Strange, Carolyn “Introduction”.

"“Community punishments” -- evaluated in sensible ways -- are more cost effective than prison.  Given “the lack of any demonstrable superiority on the part of institutional sentencing in controlling recidivism, [it is] custody not community sentencing that has to be justified and defended” (p.179-80).",", Background. Everyone is in favour of the evaluation of the impact of different types of sentences.  Fewer, however, ask what it is that should be evaluated.  These are not “neutral” decisions, since two sentences might be equally likely to have a favourable impact on recidivism, but one might cost three times as much as the other (e.g., a community sanction vs. prison).  An evaluation that did not look at cost would lead to a different conclusion than one that did.   In addition, one must be extraordinarily careful to understand what the meaning is of certain types of  “evaluative” findings.   An English study, for example, found that there were “204 serious incident reports” in a 13 month period ending in December 1996 involving those serving sentences in the community. Though that may sound like a lot, it is noteworthy that England has about 200,000 people serving sentences in the community at any one time.   
 
Evaluation studies are important since they appear to show that, all things considered, there is no evidence that “prison works” (p. 173-4). In thinking about “recidivism” it is important to realize that the seriousness of the offence of conviction is a poor indicator of the likelihood that someone will reoffend.  A “seriously recidivist” shoplifter is more likely to get probation than is a person who committed a serious, though uncharacteristic,  violent offence.  In fact, given that many “high risk to reoffend” people are given probation, it is surprising that the recidivism rates for probation are not dramatically higher than prison. “In the aggregate, community-based punishments are at least as effective in tackling recidivism as an institutional sentence. Put the other way around, the research evidence certainly does not rule out the use of community sentences on the grounds of public protection, especially when what is being looked for is long term efficacy against recidivism rather than some shorter term incapacitative effect” (p. 179)., Then why are prison populations increasing in many countries?  England’s Lord Chief Justice suggests that “The tenor of political rhetoric has strongly favoured the imposition of severe sentences; this rhetoric has been faithfully reflected in certain elements of the media; and judges accused of passing lenient sentences have found themselves routinely castigated in some newspapers... The increase in the prison population is not explained by any recent increase in sentencing powers, and I have no doubt that it is related to the pressure of public opinion” (quoted on p. 188).    One suggestion made here is that there needs to be an attempt “to find better ways of insulating [sentencing policy] from the immediate influences of political fortune hunting that have led in the past to ambivalence, inconsistency and injustice” (p. 196).   “The problem with opting for tougher sentencing policies, even ostensibly in the short term, is that it is not necessarily the same thing as taking reasonable and effective steps against crime...  Moreover, the evidence [from England] and elsewhere suggests strongly that the public will never be satisfied with tougher new regimes unless widespread misperceptions about leniency in sentencing are challenged and changed” (p. 191)., Reference: Brownlee, Ian.

"The nature of hate crimes may have changed over the centuries, but attacks on (largely) “devalued, disenfranchised, and isolated” groups have occurred for centuries.  At the same time, a careful examination of the burnings of black churches in the US in 1996 demonstrated  that what might appear to be an epidemic of hate motivated crime may turn out to be a media-created moral panic.",", Hate crimes are not a new phenomenon.  The nature of the crimes, and, as a result of new technologies, the potential harms that “hate groups” can cause may have increased, but the phenomenon has been part of the history of western countries for centuries.  It does not take much work to find examples of what we would now call “hate motivated” crimes in any historical period., Defining the phenomenon is not straightforward, but, for the most part, an examination of what usually falls into the category suggests that, for the most part, the victims are usually vulnerable, and the perpetrators see the group (with which the immediate victim is identified) as a threat to their way of life.  Looking at US history over the past couple of centuries, one can count each of the following as an example of “hate crimes” that were, to varying extents, acceptable in American society:   the killing of thousands of Native Americans, the lynching of blacks, and the enslaving of African-Americans.  The fact that some of these were institutionalised makes some of them slightly different from crimes carried out by individuals.  Nevertheless, those institutionalised events set the stage for individualized attacks on members of these groups., Perhaps the most important change to have occurred in recent years is that individuals and groups involved in hate crimes have available to them weapons which allow for more damage to be done by smaller numbers of people (e.g., high powered automatic rifles, bombs, etc.).  In addition, some have argued that as extremist ideologies (and religious zealotry) grow in acceptance, the potential for hate crime increases.  On the other hand, minority populations are more integrated and less isolated., One difficulty that arises in dealing with “hate motivated crimes” is that it is often difficult to identify whether there is, in fact, an increase in particular types of crimes or if these crimes are simply being noticed and reported more and linked by the media.  The “1996 Black Church fires” in the US are one example.   These fires were described in such words as being part of a pattern, a wave, an epidemic, or a conspiracy.  They were seen as being “part of a much deeper problem” and as part of an “organized effort...”  The president of the US compared them to genocide in Bosnia and Rwanda and the Holocaust.   The only problem with the “epidemic” of black church fires is that when one looks carefully at the investigations of these fires, “no epidemic of church arsons was demonstrated”  (p. 508).  Although “some suspects were implicated in more than one fire, and a handful were members of racist groups... the majority of those convicted acted alone; they were juveniles, mentally ill people, thieves, opportunists, and copycats” (p.509).  “The 1996 church fires almost certainly were not a wave of arsons; more likely they were a reporting phenomenon” (p. 512).  Though “it is commendable that the US has become sensitive to racial violence… (p.512),  there is concern that explaining “ordinary” crimes as “hate crimes” may lead those who are seen as the targets “to become more fearful, suspicious, and angry….”   Also, many white Americans “may become sceptical of reports of [actual] racist incidents in the future” (p. 512).  “Adopting the worst possible interpretation of ugly events is unlikely to produce positive societal effects.”  On the other hand, it is possible “as Emile Durkheim would have predicted, [that] the societal response to the violation of widely shared values (religious freedom and racial tolerance) has reaffirmed those values” (p. 513)., References: Petrosino, Carolyn.  Connecting the past to the future: Hate crime in America.

"Employment for those being released from prison can reduce recidivism, but success may be tied to building in a follow-up program to address the wide range of difficulties that ex-prisoners experience.",", Background.  It is thought that one of the reasons that “jobs programs” for offenders often fail is that they are not intensive enough and that many offenders suffer from other personal (e.g., substance abuse) and social (lack of affordable housing)  problems.  Moreover, many prison programs focus on “job readiness” (training the person for potential jobs) rather than on job placement., This paper looks at the research literature on a more limited number of prison employment programs -- those that focus on “preparing inmates and parolees for employment and [which help] them find jobs” (p. 91).   These programs -- which appear to address the real employment needs of many ex-prisoners -- provide services in a custodial setting as well as providing support and post-employment follow-up rather than limiting themselves to “traditional job preparation and placement assistance.”  The type of assistance these programs offer varies enormously from client to client.  In one case, an employment specialist arranged for a client to receive necessary dietary supplements, clothing, medical care and eyeglasses so as to ensure that these problems did not interfere with employment.  One program has special “lifeguards” who “do nothing but remain in touch with placed clients for a year after they have found job, offering help with any emerging problems that arise, from finding child care to meeting a parole mandate to enter substance abuse counselling” (p. 105)., The results of these programs is encouraging but not miraculous. The programs seem to be relatively successful in placing their clients in jobs. Furthermore, the rate of getting jobs appears to be much higher for those who were in the programs than for those who did not participate. Minority group members appeared to benefit most from the programs. There is some evidence that the programs reduce the reincarceration rate, especially for those who seem to be at high risk for being unemployed., One study estimated that in a large program (that serviced 6500 clients) costing about $4 million for one year, about 20% “avoided reincarceration in part because of their participation in [the program] and resulting employment.”   Incarceration costs for them would have been over $19 million.  The over $15 million savings does not include an estimated $1.2 million that these ex-offenders paid in taxes., There seem to be two prerequisites to success in running these programs: good working relationships with other agencies and a willingness and an ability to help ex-offenders with various problems that they face which are barriers to peaceful reintegration. Nevertheless, it is clear that programs such as these can succeed if “help” to ex-offenders can be extended, with stable government funding, to the period beyond the formal sentence., Reference: Finn, Peter.  Job placement for offenders in relation to recidivism.

"Judges in the US appear to be considering the possibility of being more active in speaking publicly about their roles. Most American judges who responded to a recent survey believe that they are under more pressure to be accountable to public opinion, and there appears to be a growing belief that judicial independence does not necessarily require judicial public silence.",", Background. A recent survey of federal and state judges in the Midwestern United States “demonstrates the difficulties for courts in relying on third parties to represent their functioning to the public” (p. 113).   The suggestion is made that “in contemporary society the ability of courts to act as independent decision makers depends on their involvement in local communities through various public outreach efforts” (p. 113).  As many commentators have pointed out (in the US and in Canada) judges have a difficult time, when they act as if they have sworn an oath of public silence, in responding to irresponsible or uninformed criticism of their judgements.  There is questioning of the  traditional view of judges roles, that “when individual judges render decisions fairly, responsibly, and competently, the courts as an institution will presumably enjoy the respect and goodwill of the citizens” (p. 113).  The opposing view appears to be gathering support: “isolation from society is increasingly insufficient for maintaining support” (p. 113).
 
This survey of judges suggests that most (91% of those surveyed) judges would feel comfortable speaking with a reporter about an area of law or judicial process that is generally misunderstood.  This is obviously quite different from defending a specific decision, but does suggest that these judges would be comfortable venturing down from their benches.  Part of the reason that so many judges may be willing to take the plunge into public debate is that most (73%) reported that there had been recent attacks on judges in their states and most (81%) feel that these attacks do serious harm to the public’s opinion of the judiciary.  Judges in the US, like those in this country, generally do not respond publicly to criticism: only 9 of the 88 judges who had been “recently and publicly criticized” responded in any way to the criticism.  Only two felt that their responses were effective., Judges think that the future looks bleak unless they do something.  Most (84%) thought that courts “should devote more resources to public relations” (p. 116).  It would appear that US judges are not satisfied with leaving their defence to others (e.g., lawyers)., Conclusion. Clearly there is tension between judicial independence and public accountability.  However, the argument is made that the “court’s legitimacy rests on their independence and fairness.... At the same time, simply asserting the importance of judicial independence and accountability... rings hollow given democratic expectations for accountability.  Judicial independence itself is vulnerable to the claim that judges are ‘out of touch.’ The problem of public criticism of courts exposes this circularity -- that judicial independence rests on judicial legitimacy and vice versa -- and implies that courts’ best institutional response is to promote both responsiveness and independence through greater involvement in the community and through public education and outreach efforts” (p. 117).  Clearly the issues are not simple ones. One wonders whether Canadian judges would, as a group, be comfortable speaking publicly about what they do., Reference: Esterling, Kevin M.  Public outreach: the cornerstone of judicial independence.  Judicature, November-December 1998, 82 (3), 112-117., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV2N3.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-2-no-3-%E2%80%93-april-1999,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 2, No. 3 – April 1999",Regular Issue,1999
The Young Offenders Act did not cause youth crime: During the period 1977-1996 there was little overall change in police-reported youth crime in Canada.,", Background.  There are no direct measures of youth crime. Instead we infer youth crime by looking at police and court activities with youthful offenders.  The police data (Uniform Crime Reports) contain two relevant measures: youth charged, and youth handled otherwise.  Both of these are imperfect measures since for a youth to be charged or dealt with otherwise, not only does an offence have to have been committed, but a youth must be apprehended and seen as having committed the offence.  Assuming that reporting rates (and recording practices) have not changed, these measures give us some indication of what crime can legitimately be blamed on youth., This paper represents an attempt to explain a simple sounding finding: “the per capita rate of young persons charged has increased significantly since the inception of the Young Offenders Act (YOA).”   It suggests that if there were a sudden change in youth crime after the full implementation of the YOA in 1985 that could not be attributed to other identifiable causes, that would support the conclusion that the YOA was in some way a cause.   There is a complex set of technical problems which this paper had to address before examining the data from police reports (Uniform Crime Reports): creating measures of the apprehension and charging of youth that are comparable across the years 1977 to 1996 at a time when the definition of a youth was changing (from age 7 to 12, and from age 15 to 17 in some provinces)., The results are quite clear.  “The per capita rate of youth apprehended by police increased rapidly during the late 1970s.... From 1980 to 1988, youth crime remained at about the same level, then it rose to a peak in 1991, and fell back almost to its former level by 1996” (p. 13).    This overall increase from the 1970s to the 1990s cannot, therefore, be attributed to the YOA, since most of the increase took place either before the YOA was implemented or some years after., Looking at the data on a province-to-province basis, one finds that the apprehension of youth showed a “jump” after 1985 in NB, SK, and BC.  However, there were drops in rates in Quebec and Ontario, and no evidence of change in the other five provinces and two territories., Rates at which youth were charged are, however, quite a different matter.  Across Canada, there was “a jump in charging in 1986 that did not occur in apprehensions of young persons” (p. 18).  The result was that there was a 27% higher charge rate in 1986-96 as compared to 1980-83, as compared to a 7% increase in apprehension rate.  In other words, the police exercised their discretion differently under the YOA than they had under the JDA: they charged a higher proportion of those youth who were apprehended. Quebec was the only province that showed a decrease in charge rates (p. 23).  What happened in the other provinces is that the YOA clearly changed police charging practice.  Furthermore a previous detailed analysis of two provinces (Ontario and Saskatchewan) suggests that the increase in proportions charged “applied over the entire YOA age range... and was therefore not simply due to the addition of 16 and 17 year olds...” (p. 24)., Conclusion. “There is no basis in fact for public concern about increased level of youth crime or the supposed failure of the YOA to control youth crime.”  We should be careful not to attribute changes in the behaviour of adults (charging practices) to youth (crime)., Reference.

In 1998 the US prison system hit a new plateau: It now has 1 million people in prison for non-violent offences. Most of the increase in prison population in recent years is due to an increase in non-violent prisoners.   The evidence is clear: very high levels of imprisonment have negligible impacts on crime rates but large impacts on the ability to fund other government programs.,", Background.  The United States now has 1.8 million people in prisons and jails.  California, with a population about 8% larger than Canada, has about 145,000 people in its state prisons and jails in comparison with Canada’s 34,000 (page 10).  From 1992 to 1996 homicide rates in California decreased by about 25% and prison populations increased by the same amount., Many Americans may believe that most of those in prisons are violent offenders and, even if prisons are not rehabilitative, there is, at least, an incapacitative impact of large scale imprisonment.  There are, however, two responses to such views: (1) most – 77% -- of the growth in prison populations in the US in recent years has been in non-violent offenders, and (2) as a crime control strategy,  broadly based incapacitation is extraordinarily inefficient.  Michael Tonry, one of America’s most informed and intelligent criminal justice researchers, points out that “you could choose another two million Americans at random and lock them up, and that would reduce the number of crimes, too” (page 10).  The question, really, is what the size of the impact is on crime and what the opportunity costs are of a high imprisonment policy., These impacts of high imprisonment policies are obviously not evenly felt. “There are four times as many African American men in California’s prisons as in its university system….The District of Columbia… has more inmates in its prisons than students in its university system” (p. 9)., The impact of high levels of imprisonment is now quite evident.   “In 1995… there was nearly a dollar-for-dollar tradeoff between corrections and higher education, with university construction funds decreasing by $954 million (to $2.5 billion) while corrections funding increased by $926 million (to $2.6 billion)” (p. 8).  Similar tradeoffs are found in university operating costs (p. 8-9)., Much has been made, in recent years, of the drop in crime rate in New York. “But, ironically, New York’s crime rate fell despite the fact that it has had one of the slowest growing prison systems… over the past few years, and the New York City jail system has seen a real decline in the number of people it has held over this period” (p. 12). Statistic after statistic can be presented demonstrating that changes in crime rates appear to be unrelated to imprisonment rate changes.  New York’s violent crime rate decreased by about 39% between 1992 and 1997 with an increase in its prison population of about 13%.  California, on the other hand, had a smaller decrease in its violent crime rate (23%) but had a larger (30%) prison population increase., Concerns are being expressed now about the longer term impact of high levels of imprisonment on those currently in prison.  Eventually almost all will be released but “their chances of pursuing a merely viable, much less satisfying, conventional life after prison are diminished by their time behind bars” (p. 13).  Research carried out some time ago shows that “convicted felons sent to prison had significantly higher rates of rearrest after release than similar offenders placed on probation” (p. 13).  The long term impacts are yet to come., Reference: Irwin, John, Vincent Schiraldi and Jason Ziedenberg.  America’s One Million Nonviolent Prisoners.  Justice Policy Institute, 1999., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV2N3.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-2-no-3-%E2%80%93-april-1999,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 2, No. 3 – April 1999",Regular Issue,1999
"The boot camp model -- with military style discipline -- appeals to politicians who want to look “tough on crime”.  Boot camps offer not only punishment and retribution, but people also claim that they deter and rehabilitate offenders.  However, research reveals that youth who are placed in boot camps are more likely to recidivate than youth who are placed on probation or who are placed in traditional custodial institutions.","The Context:  Over the past decade crime issues and crime control agendas have become part of political campaigns. Politicians seem to want to look “tough on crime”.  The boot camp model -- with military style discipline -- therefore appeals to politicians and to the public.  “When the public and the politicians demand tougher sanctions, correctional systems are able to maintain their legitimacy by delivering “tough” boot camps” (p. 72).  Boot camps are seen, miraculously, as being able to fulfill, simultaneously, the goals of retribution, deterrence and rehabilitation.  While the treatment within boot camps vary, a strict military regimen is present in all programs., Boot camps have been one of the fastest growing so-called “fixes” to youth crime.  For example, in 1984 only two states operated boot camps.  However, by 1994 36 states were operating boot camps.  Given that many states in the U.S., as well as some provinces in  Canada, have now implemented such programs, the obvious question that arises is: does participation in such a program actually reduce recidivism?, This study investigated recidivism rates among first time offenders (N=1,937) who were placed on probation (30%), in traditional custodial institutions (41%), or in boot camps (29%).  The majority offenders were convicted of property offences., The results revealed that offenders who were placed in boot camps were more likely to recidivate after release than the offenders placed on probation or in a normal prison.  During a 2.5 year period, 17% of the offenders placed on probation, and 20% of the offenders in prison re-offended, while 35% of offenders from boot camps re-offended.  The finding -- that offenders from boot camps are more likely to recidivate than offenders in prison or probation -- is consistent with other evaluations of boot camps., The results also revealed that no matter where offenders had to serve their sentence, as they got older, they were less likely to re-offend. This finding is consistent with other criminological research which demonstrates that offenders appear to “mature out” of crime., This study also investigated participants’ perceptions of boot camp. The perceived level of severity of the boot camp did not affect the participants’ perception of their own rehabilitation.  Those who believed that rehabilitation was the main goal of the boot camp program were more likely to believe that they had been rehabilitated., Conclusion:  Although boot camps have been sold to the public as a means by which to reduce crime and change offenders’ attitudes, there is no such evidence that this is being accomplished.  Offenders from boot camps appear to be slightly more likely to re-offend than other groups of offenders.  If there is any attitudinal change among boot camp attendees, it is likely to be only temporary., Reference: Wright, D. and Mays, L.

"Two possible reasons why empirical evidence has failed to provide a clear consensus on the relationship between income inequality, poverty and homicide rates are (1) that the relationship may be time dependent, and (2) the nature of the relationship is  contingent on the type of homicide being analyzed.",", Background. There is a long history of criminological debate over the effect of income inequality and poverty on crime.  Under conditions of absolute deprivation, some theorists have argued that crime is a way ‘to make money for poor people’ who are faced with situations of chronic unemployment and underemployment (p. 571). Crime, subsequently, results in more violence than most types of legitimate employment.  In terms of relative deprivation, individuals compare what they have to others in their community or through media exposure. When they are unable to achieve ‘culturally defined goals,’ strain and/or frustration develop that manifests itself into violent behavior. Finally, theories explaining both absolute and relative deprivation suggest that social values develop which support violence as a way of life and a means to achieve desired goals.  These values are transmitted through successive generations. Despite the proliferation of theories to explain this association, however, empirical evidence remains contradictory., This study takes a more thorough approach to the analysis of the relationship between income inequality, poverty and homicide rates using various measures of income inequality not incorporated into other analyses including (1) the ratio of the percentage of total U.S. income received by the top 20% of families to that of the bottom 20%; and (2) the share of income received by the top 20% of families.  Poverty is measured by the percentage of the population below the poverty line.  Cities in the U.S. are used as the unit of analysis examining the period 1989-1991, what the authors refer to as the Post-Reagan era., Results. While the data indicate that income inequality and poverty are positively associated with rates of homicide, this relationship varies depending on the type of homicide analyzed (i.e. family, acquaintance, or stranger homicide).  As unemployment rates, divorce rates and population size increase, so do city homicide rates.  Among all factors examined, the number of black residents was the strongest predictor (the greater the black population, the greater the homicide rate). When homicide rates are disaggregated according to victim-offender relationship, the findings remain primarily consistent with the initial results. Poverty or inequality are significant for all three types of homicide.  However, family homicide is more closely associated with socioeconomic factors (inequality and poverty and, perhaps, unemployment) while acquaintance homicides are influenced more by subcultural factors (i.e.,  proportion of blacks in the city).  Stranger homicide is predicted by either, depending on the circumstances (robbery versus other felony). The authors suggest that their finding of a positive relationship is based in part on the time period which they are analyzing.  Prior to the period of study (1989-1991) and during much of the century, the manufacturing industry provided stable employment to those with few skills and little education.  The 1980s, however, was a decade of change which, by the end of the decade, resulted in decreased legitimate employment for low-skilled workers in disadvantaged areas, thus increasing the likelihood that illegitimate opportunities would be sought out., Conclusion. At this point in our history, economic inequality and poverty are positively linked to increases in certain types of homicide rates.  Considering the present economic deterioration and the obstacles to socioeconomic revitalization, it is reasonable to suggest that any long-term improvements to the quality of life experienced by residents of poor and disadvantaged areas is going to depend on macrolevel social and economic transformations that provide increased opportunities for individuals of all classes and skill levels. Changes in economic structures do affect crime, but the effects are complex., Reference: Kovandzic, Tomislav V., Lynne M Vieraitis, and Mark R. Yeisley.

"Treating serious young offenders as adults does not enhance public safety, nor does the practice of forcing young people who commit “adult” offences to do “adult time” in adult facilities. These hard line practices may appear to be “tough on crime,” but, in fact, they are more likely to be “tough on safety.”",", Getting “tough” on youth crime appears to translate into treating young offenders as adults.  There are a number of empirically based reasons for doubting whether the transfers of youths into the adult system (or the sentencing of young people as adults) accomplishes what its advocates hope:, In addition, those in the U.S. who value their children might be concerned to find that in the U.S. juveniles in adult prisons are, compared to juveniles in juvenile facilities “eight times more likely to commit suicide, 500 times more likely to be sexually  assaulted and 200 times more likely to be beaten by staff…” (p. 9).   In addition, adult facilities typically lack programs appropriate for youth, in part because the number of youth in a given facility tends to be small., In the U.S., where some estimates suggest that about 180,000-200,000 youths are tried in the adult system each year (as contrasted with fewer than 100 a year in Canada), the US Department of Justice concluded that “[Transfer] does not appreciably increase the certainty or severity of sanctions” (quoted, p. 12)., Interestingly, one of the suggestions is that “juvenile courts [be empowered] to impose adult sentences, with authority to supervise rehabilitation… into adulthood…” (p. 12) similar to provisions in the (proposed) Youth Criminal Justice Act., The policy conclusions, presuming that one is interested in reducing crime, are clear: “Minimize the number of juvenile cases transferred to [adult] court…” (p. 12).  “The research reviewed here indicates that something inherent in criminal [adult] court processing may produce increased recidivism” (p. 13).  Clearly, few benefits, in terms of either short-term or long-term safety flow from sending youths into adult court., Reference: Redding, Richard E.  Juvenile offenders in criminal court and adult prison: Legal, psychological, and behavioural outcomes.  Juvenile and Family Court Journal, Winter 1999, 1-20., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV2N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-2-no-4-%E2%80%93-june-1999,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 2, No. 4 – June 1999",Regular Issue,1999
"Socioeconomic status has important links with crime. But it can work both ways. Low socioeconomic status promotes crime by increasing alienation, financial strain, aggression, etc., and thus increasing crime. But children from high socioeconomic status homes are likely to become involved in  crime in a different way: they are more likely to take risks and less likely to accept conventional values.",", Background.  Although socioeconomic status (SES) has been important in theorizing about the causes of crime, “empirical studies consistently have found weak or nonexistent correlations between individuals’ socioeconomic background and their self-reported delinquent behaviour” (p. 176)., This paper takes a different approach.  It assumes that SES works through other “mediating variables.”  Those from low SES families might be more likely to feel alienated from society, might be more likely to feel financial strain, would have lower aspirations and perhaps less self-control.  On the other hand, those from high SES families might have a higher propensity to take risks, would “see themselves as above society’s precepts… and [might] assess themselves as being at relatively low risk of detection and punishment for their deviant acts” (p. 179).  In other words, to varying extents in different individuals, SES could have different effects., This study looked at self-reported delinquency from a sample of New Zealand 21- year olds who had participated in a longitudinal study since birth.   Overall, there was no simple relationship of SES with crime.  However, low SES was associated with financial strain, aggression, alienation, and low educational and vocational aspirations.  High SES was associated with a “taste” for risk, feelings of social power, a low perceived risk of detection and low attachment to conventional values., The results show that when  “taste” for risk, feelings of social power, perceived risk of detection,  and attachment to conventional values are held constant, low SES was, in fact, associated with higher levels of delinquency.  On the other hand, holding financial strain, aggression, educational and vocational aspirations, attachment to the community and social control constant, high SES was associated with delinquency., Conclusion. Given that socio-economic status is both positively and negatively related to crime, it would appear that  “prevention programs working with young people in a given segment of society [should] focus upon those crime-related characteristics found most commonly in that segment [of society].  For example, in the lower social classes, prevention programs might find the most success in attempting to reduce levels of aggression and alienation while increasing educational and occupational aspirations. Conversely, in the high social classes, programs might do well to emphasize conventional values and the risk of crime” (p. 191)., Reference: Wright, Bradley R.Entner,  Avshalom Caspi, Terrie E.

"Though “getting tough” is a common sense approach to reducing crime,  there is a need to find a replacement for it since it is an ineffective response to a serious problem. Promoting “social support” is a sensible alternative approach in part because it “appeals to people’s common sense and thus has intuitive legitimacy” and it works.",", The problem for those who reject (for ideological or empirical reasons) a “get tough” or “more control” approach to crime prevention is that a substitute is needed. This substitute must provide an articulate and intuitively appealing substitute.  “Social support is a worthy candidate as a public idea to organize thinking and action…” (p.190).  It is not only “good criminology,” but also “the idea that social support protects against crime appeals to people’s common sense and thus has intuitive legitimacy” (p.190)., A social support approach to crime prevention “starts with the… assumption that supportive relations, beginning at birth, are integral to healthy human development” (p. 192).  In addition to other supportive findings, “It is noteworthy that early intervention programs that give support to at-risk families and youngsters help both to prevent the onset of misconduct and to reduce criminal involvement once it occurs….” (p.193). Though there is evidence that social support is likely to have its strongest effects in childhood, there is evidence that “receiving social support is inversely related to delinquent involvement” for adolescents as well (p.193)., American researchers have attributed the high rate of U.S. violent crime relative to other countries in part to widening inequality, “mean spirited welfare policies,” and the fact that other countries have “state and social institutions [that are] arranged to give support to their citizens” (p.194).   Other studies (contained in earlier “Highlights” issues) show that supportive communities are less likely to have high violence rates (p.194)., The problem for criminologists is that it is not sufficient to explain “why conservative narratives about crime are best considered to be fairy tales” (p.196).   Conservative narratives are attractive because they “have drama (‘Superpredators are now roaming free…’), they stir our emotions [by referring to victims], they acquit us of blame (‘Society doesn’t commit crime, offenders do’), they pinpoint who the real culprit is (‘Liberal courts…’), and they give simple solutions that promise to have large results (‘Lock up the predators….’) (p.196).  An alternative narrative is needed.  Social support may work because it is a matter of common sense and “many citizens want more than an a society of atomized individuals…” (p. 197).  Early intervention programs and community support programs (e.g., Big Brothers/Sisters) have been shown to be effective. Rehabilitative programs can be described both in support terms but also in terms of being a means of making society safer., Conclusion. There is evidence that “cultural values that de-legitimate crass utilitarian individualism and that reinforce support or altruism are likely to reduce conditions conducive to criminal behaviour” (p.202).   “The challenge for progressives is to develop public ideas – stories about crime – that appeal to the nobler side of the citizenry, that seem rooted in common sense, and that can effect meaningful savings in crime….” Social support “is  a construct that makes sense to most people and that is consistent with their vision of what a good society entails” (p.204).  It is also a good way of reducing crime., Reference: Cullen, Francis T., John Paul Wright, and Mitchell B.

“Zero tolerance policing” is no more effective in reducing crime than is its ideological opposite: problem oriented community policing.  But “zero tolerance policing” has the added disadvantage of creating tension between the police and the community and in criminalizing large numbers of people without any apparent benefit.”,", Background.  New York City is often held out as an example of how “getting tough” in policing “works.”  Dramatic reductions in reported crime that occurred between 1993 and 1997 are used by the former police chief, William Bratton, and New York officials to support their assertion that “zero tolerance” policing works.  The only problem with their logic is that there are comparable reductions in crime in other locations that have taken dramatically different approaches to policing.  The most dramatic aspect of policing in New York is that “at the neighbourhood level, [Bratton’s] crime-fighting strategies were grounded in traditional law enforcement methods and in relentless crackdown campaigns to arrest and jail low-level drug offenders and other petty perpetrators” (p.173)., The changes in reported crime in NY need to be examined in the context of falling crime rates elsewhere in the US, Canada, and Europe.  In San Diego, California, for example,  there was a “virtually equal reduction in rates of serious crime” as in NY in the first part of the 1990s but there was only a trivial increase in the number of sworn police officers (6.2%) compared to NY’s increase of 39.5%., One set of problems with NY’s zero-tolerance policing is that it appears to be associated with a great deal of tolerance for police misconduct and abuse.  The number of complaints against the police increased 60%.  These included a “sudden and sharp increase” in the number of “complaints filed by citizens… that involved incidents where no arrest was made or summons issued” (p. 176). Investigation into one incident of police torture found the incident was part of a “pattern of police abuse, brutality, and misconduct” (p. 176).  Hence, even if policing did play a part in the reduction of crime, there was a cost.   The best guess, however, is that “No single factor, cause, policy, or strategy has produced the drop in crime rates” (p.178)., Conclusion. When crime rates go down, the police are often quick to take credit for the drop, though they seem to be less eager to take responsibility for increases that occur from time to time.  Policing may well affect crime rates, but New York’s decline in crime, which mirrors reductions occurring elsewhere, cannot legitimately be used as evidence that “zero tolerance” works.  There are serious costs in a “zero tolerance” approach to crime.  Those who favour it would do well to consider these costs when evaluating zero tolerance approaches in comparison to other policing techniques that have been implemented elsewhere and which are associated with comparable reductions., Reference: Greene, Judith A.  Zero tolerance: A case study of police practices and practices in New York City.  Crime and Delinquency, 1999 (April), 45 (2), 171-187., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV2N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-2-no-4-%E2%80%93-june-1999,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 2, No. 4 – June 1999",Regular Issue,1999
Interventions into the lives of anti-social kindergarten children can have a lasting impact on their lives. Small investments in small children pay big dividends immediately and when the children become bigger.,", Background.  “If criminal justice interventions into the lives of children are not likely to reduce anti-social behaviour, what kinds of programs actually do work?”  This type of question is often asked.  Programs do exist, but many of them have not been properly evaluated.  This study demonstrates that children can be changed with a program that starts off with children who are just starting school., The program.  The program, “First Step to Success,” focuses on “at risk” kindergarten children, but involves teachers, peers,  parents or caregivers, as well as the child.  It starts with a formal screening of kindergarten children to identify problem children.  The school intervention has 30 “formal” days of programming, though since a child must “pass” each day, it may take more than 30 days to complete.  Typically it takes about 40 days.  The first five days involve a “consultant” who need not be a formal professional.  On each of these days, there are two 20-30 minute sessions in school.  Essentially, it is a program where the child earns negotiated school and home privileges for appropriate behaviour.  The details of how the privileges are earned change over time.  What is important, however, is that it is a fairly rigid “program” designed to effect change at home and at school., The study involved comparing a group of children to a randomly assigned “waiting list control” group of children.  Quite large (and statistically significant) changes were found in the treatment group that were not found in the wait-list control group. Although the experiment was carried out when the children were in kindergarten, one group was followed through Grade 2. The improvements in the children’s behaviour continued., The results are “consistent with existing literature on the case for early intervention with at-risk children…. That is, comprehensive early interventions, especially those involving parents, appear to (a) teach relationships between choices and their resulting consequences, (b) develop the social-behavioural and academically related competencies that allow children to cope effectively with the demands of friendship-making… and (c) reduce the long-term probability that at-risk children will adopt a delinquent lifestyle in adolescence” (p. 74).   Furthermore, “by the standards used in other fields, [the program] is a relatively brief and inexpensive intervention” (p.76).  Responses to the program by teachers and parents have been “generally positive, perhaps because the demands on them during implementation are relatively low level compared to the gains achieved” (p. 76)., Conclusion. This intervention into the lives of “at risk” children appears to have been successful in reducing anti-social behaviour.   Furthermore, it would appear to be a program that parents and teachers approve of and which can be implemented with rather minimal cost. Though it is hard to estimate the actual cost of the program, it would appear that the cost of “treating” a single child would be less than the dollar cost of charging a single child with a common assault and having that child go through the court system and receive an absolute discharge at the end.  This cost estimate, of course, ignores the other beneficial effects of the program and the harmful impact of criminal justice contact., Reference: Walker, Hill M., Kate Kavanagh, Bruce Stiller, Annemieke Golly, Herbert H.

US data suggest that there is no support for the assertion that there is a “youth violence epidemic.”  There was a large increase in certain violent offences (murder and aggravated assault) in the US which is largely attributable to an increase in gun crimes.  Furthermore there is no reason to assume that the upcoming relatively small change in the proportion of youth in the population will create a new “crime wave.”,", Background.  Trends over time in crime rates are not only notoriously difficult to explain.  They are also difficult to describe.  The nature of the trends vary across crimes.   Though in the U.S. there was an increase in the rates of aggravated assault and homicide involving offenders age 13-17 in the late 1980s, there were sharp reductions in the early 1990s.  Similar trends were not found for robbery and rape.   The increase in the youth (offender) homicide rate which occurred in the late 1980s appeared to be completely due to an increase in gun homicides.  Interestingly, there was no comparable change in the homicide rates of those aged 25-34., There appears to have been a change in police behaviour, with “a greater police willingness to report and upwardly classify assault crimes and a greater willingness to arrest those who commit assaults…”(p.42).  Victimization  surveys carried out in schools in the US show that “involvement in serious assaults are virtually identical in 1982 and 1992,”  but police data show big increases., Predictions about the future from police reported crime are not very useful “because rates of serious offenses tend to be cyclical in unpredictable ways” (p. 45).  But equally important is the fact that the trends are different for different crimes.  Hence one cannot talk about trends of violent crime since these vary across individual crimes., Demographic changes are, of course, relevant to predictions about crime. As the age distribution of a population changes, there will, of course, be some changes in overall rates of crime.  However, these effects need to be put in context.  A five or ten percent increase in the “crime prone” part of the population will, to some extent, affect crime rates.  But in the U.S., the factor that is important in understanding overall crime rates are the “age specific” crime rates.  For example, in 1984, the homicide rate for males age 13-17 was about 10 per 100,000 inhabitants, Ten years later it was close to 35. “Age specific” crime rates are dramatically more important than minor changes in the age distribution of society., Those, like James Q. Wilson and John DiIulio, who predict an army of “terrifying teenagers” or “super-predators” have, in fact, used inappropriate, and in some instances, bizarre arithmetic  techniques to substantiate these predictions.   The prediction of a “predatory menace” of youths is described as a “classic case of a compounded distortion” (p.60).    The extreme example is that of DiIulio whose calculations would lead one to the conclusion that there are “already 1.9 million juvenile superpredators on U.S. streets.”  The difficulty with this statement is that “That happens to be more young people than were accused of any form of delinquency last year in the U.S.” (p.62)., Conclusion. Youth crime is serious enough without distorting either the trends that exist or the predictions for the future.  Given the changes in rates of youth crime which have occurred in recent years, we should be hesitant in making predictions for the future., Reference: Zimring, Franklin E.  American Youth Violence (New York: Oxford, 1998).

"Canadians’ views of the criminal courts are more complex than we had previously thought: Wealthy people are more likely than poor people to think that the courts are doing a poor job of helping victims of crime, whereas poor people are more likely than wealthy people to think that courts are doing a poor job of protecting the rights of the accused.","Public support for the criminal justice system is clearly important.  Courts are seen as being too lenient by a majority of Canadian adults. Members of racial minority groups in Canada believe that racial discrimination is a problem within the criminal justice system.  Victims’ groups are often critical of both the manner in which victims are treated and the rights that accused people have in the courts.   These views of the courts (or of the police) tend to be expressed in broad terms rather than in terms of specific attitudes.  This paper, instead, looks at two specific attitudes of Canadians: views of how well the courts help victims of crime and how well the courts protect the rights of the accused., This paper starts with the assumption that Canada’s upper classes will identify more with victims of crime, suggesting that “the upper classes’ identification with victims of crime is based on stereotypes which cast offenders as members of the lower classes” (p.370).  On the other hand, “individuals of lower socio-economic status are predicted to identify more closely with accused individuals and [are] also more likely to perceive that the rights of accused individuals are not being protected” (p.370)., The data used in this paper come from the 1993 Statistics Canada General Social Survey, a nationwide survey of 10,385 adults over the age of 15.   Among other questions, people were asked to “rate the courts in helping victims of crime” and “rate the courts in protecting the rights of accused.”   Many more people saw courts as doing a poor job in providing help to victims (49%) than in protecting accuseds’ rights (13%)., The findings show that members of high and low socio-economic groups had quite different views.  Those from higher household income groups were more likely than those from poorer households to think that courts were doing a poor job in helping victims of crime.  On the other hand, those from poorer households were more likely than those from richer households to think that courts were doing an inadequate job of protecting the rights of the accused.  Similarly, it is the relatively highly educated who are most likely to think that the courts are doing a poor job of providing help to victims of crime.  “Income remained a significant predictor of public attitudes, even when other important variables such as victimization, court contact, and  perceptions of crime were controlled” (p.379).  On the other hand, “consistent with previous studies…, respondents with court contact were also more likely to be dissatisfied with the courts’ treatment of victims and accused persons” (p.380)., Conclusion.  When we hear concerns being expressed about the courts’ treatment of victims and accused persons, we should remember that these concerns are, to some extent, class based: it is disproportionately the wealthy and highly educated who are most concerned about the success of the courts in providing help to victims.  Those from poor households are most likely to think that the courts are doing a poor job protecting the rights of the accused., Reference: Kaukinen, Catherine and Sandra Colavecchia.

"Privately-run prisons are no cheaper to run than publicly-run prisons once the size of the prison, its age, and its security level are taken into consideration.",", Background.  In the U.S.A. and in some other countries, the move toward  privatization of prisons is driven, in large part, by governments’ desires to reduce costs.  There are many different forms that privatization can take.  This paper looks at costs in prisons that are fully owned and operated as private facilities.  “Nearly every state in the United States currently relies on the private sector, in some capacity, for correctional services” (p.360).   The evidence on cost efficiency is mixed: some studies have suggested that private correctional facilities do operate more efficiently, while others have not., This study, using the technique known as meta-analysis, looked at “all evaluation research studies assessing the cost-effectiveness of public vs. private adult prisons…” (p. 363).  The studies need to have a cost measure included and enough information to allow for statistical controls of other determinants of cost – size of the facility (large institutions with many inmates tend to be cheaper to run), age of the facility (new institutions are cheaper to run), and security level (minimum security is cheaper to run)., The results show that when other characteristics of the prisons are taken into account, there were no financial advantages to private prisons. Generally -- whether public or private --  larger,  newer, and minimum security prisons are cheaper to run (than are smaller, older, and maximum security prisons).  Ownership, however, did not predict costs.  The results are obviously only generalizable to the kinds of prisons that were examined: adult, male prisons.  In addition, it should be remembered that there were no measures of quality of service provided in the prisons.   Overall, though, the notion that operational costs will automatically be reduced if a prison is privatized does not follow from the data.  Unless,  of course, the private prison is new, large, and minimum security., Reference: Pratt, Travis C. and Jeff Maahs.  Are private prisons more cost-effective than public prisons?  A meta-analysis of evaluation research studies.  Crime and Delinquency, 1999, 45, 358-371., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV2N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-2-no-5-%E2%80%93-september-1999,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 2, No. 5 – September 1999",Regular Issue,1999
"There appear to be racial differences in tolerance for violence: Blacks and Latinos are, if anything, less tolerant of deviance than are whites according to a recent study in Chicago. However, residents of poor areas of the city are cynical about the legal system and are dramatically less satisfied with the police.",", Background: We often make assumptions about the subcultural values and beliefs of various groups without much direct evidence. “Blacks and low-income [people]... have been posited to evince a cultural tolerance of violence” (p. 778).  It has also been suggested that cynicism about the law is directly related to an individual’s tolerance of deviance.  This paper challenges these views, suggesting that “a distinction between the tolerance of deviance and cynicism about the applicability of the law” (p. 784) needs to be made.  It suggests that “community contexts may shape ‘cognitive landscapes’ or appropriate standards and expectations of conduct” (p.781). “Inner-city contexts of racial segregation and concentrated disadvantage, where inability to influence the structures of power that constrain lives is greatest, also breed cynicism and perceptions of legal injustice” (p.783)., This study looked at 343 Chicago neighbourhoods.  Tolerance for deviance was measured by asking adult residents “how wrong” they thought the use of alcohol and drugs were, and how wrong they thought “getting into fist fights” was for 13- and 19-year olds.  Legal cynicism (e.g., “Laws are made to be broken”) and satisfaction with the police (e.g., “The  police in this neighbourhood are responsive to local issues”) were measured separately., The results showed that “African American and Latino respondents are much less tolerant of deviance than are white respondents” (p. 791). Moreover, those lowest in socio-economic status are also less tolerant of deviance. This is even true when the analysis is limited to the question that asked about the acceptability of fighting., The neighbourhood that a respondent lived in made an independent contribution to how tolerant a respondent was to deviance.   “Areas of concentrated disadvantage and residential instability appear to have increased levels of tolerance of deviance” (p.795) though when one looks only at tolerance of fighting, concentrated disadvantage was unrelated to tolerance of kids fighting., Blacks and Latinos (and those of the lowest socio-economic status) were, however, higher on the measure of legal cynicism and were less satisfied with the police. These results appear to be best explained by the neighbourhoods in which people live: “Blacks appear more cynical because they are disproportionately likely to live in residential environments of concentrated disadvantage” (p.797).  When one looks at satisfaction with the police, the effect of race appears to be due to neighbourhood and other effects. There is no impact of race on satisfaction with the police above and beyond three “neighbourhood” characteristics: Neighbourhoods with high concentrations of disadvantage, high immigrant concentrations, and high violent crime rates were less satisfied with the police., Conclusion. “There is no ‘black’ subculture of violence.  If anything, African Americans are less tolerant of crime than are their European-American counterparts. At the same time, inner-city ‘ghetto’ areas displayed elevated levels of legal cynicism, dissatisfaction with the police, and tolerance of deviance generally defined.  This consistent finding cannot be explained away by [“individual level”] differences or by levels of violent crime in the neighbourhoods” (p.800)., Reference: Sampson, Robert J. and Dawn Jeglum Bartusch.  Legal cynicism and (subcultural?) tolerance of deviance: The neighbourhood context of racial differences.  Law and Society Review, 1998, 32, 777-804., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV2N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-2-no-5-%E2%80%93-september-1999,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 2, No. 5 – September 1999",Regular Issue,1999
"Much is known today about social policies that could be put into effect – or strengthened –which act to reduce the number of children and young people who are likely to commit crimes. These include home visits and pre-school education programs, parent training programs, and school programs focusing on increasing educational attainment.",", Most criminologists today would agree that investing in the criminal justice system will do little to reduce crime.  At the same time, we know that different societies produce different rates of criminality.  Interventions based on improving the social situation of those “at risk” of becoming criminal can, then, be effective not just in terms of reducing criminality but also in providing other benefits., This paper provides examples (and references to details of programs) of interventions which reduce the likelihood of children becoming seriously criminal and which can be cost effective.  These include the following:, At the same time, it should be pointed out that not everything works.  Among the interventions that appear to be unsuccessful are the following:, “It is now accepted that, to be effective, prevention programs need to comprise a range of complementary measures which target multiple risk factors within the primary domains of a child’s life (the family, the school, the peer group and the local neighbourhood)…”(p.16).  “This chapter shows that a wide range of initiatives which target children, their families, their schools and their friends prevent criminality or reduce risk factors.”, Reference: Graham, John.

"Capital punishment – an issue for Canadians that doesn’t ever seem to disappear from the public agenda – simply does not act as a deterrent to murder.  Though the rate of executions in the U.S. appears high, and, relatively speaking, the homicide rate in many locations in the U.S. is lower than it has been for decades, a careful analysis demonstrates unequivocally that capital punishment does not deter.",", A few years ago, leader of Canada’s Reform Party, Preston Manning, suggested that if most Canadians “after reasoned debate, were to declare their conviction that the death penalty is or could be made… a deterrent, presumably this penalty has some deterrent effect, at least among those who so believe” (Globe and Mail, 4 July 1995, A13). Such views are easy to dismiss, if one can escape, momentarily, the circularity of his logic.  However, they do raise the question of whether capital punishment “works” in any way other than reducing the population of people who, for the most part, have murdered other humans., This analysis of the evidence demonstrates, using multiple sources of data, that capital punishment does not deter murder.  Various methodological approaches have been used.  Among other findings, this paper points out that:, Conclusion. No matter what data one looks at, no matter what method one uses, no matter what type of murder one tries to deter, capital punishment does not deter.  Thus if we are really interested in reducing homicide rates, we have to move our attention elsewhere., Reference: Bailey, William C. and Ruth D.

"Physical difficulties during pregnancy or difficulties experienced during the birth itself when combined with a weak (disadvantaged) familial environment  (e.g., instability of the structure of the family) increases the likelihood of violent offending for high risk  inner-city children.",", Background. There have been a fair number of studies that have suggested that the determinants of violence begin very early in a child’s life.  One of the advantages of looking at early biological influences on violent behaviour is that factors related to later violence may be susceptible to influence.  More importantly, if biological factors interact with social or environmental factors to create particular vulnerabilities, interventions could be focused on either type of factor., This study examines the influence of pre/perinatal disturbances and familial environment on criminal offending within a U.S. high risk, inner-city black population.  Detailed medical data were examined including various problems that mothers experienced during pregnancy as well as problems that might have occurred during delivery.  A “disadvantaged familial environment” was determined by looking at the number of changes in the mother’s marital status, and the “structure” of the family (whether the child live with one or two parents).  Official police records were examined to determine whether the children (from age 7 to 22) had been arrested for a violent and/or property crime., For property offending, pre/perinatal complications did not have any predictive value (alone or in combination with the family environment). However, coming from a “disadvantaged familial environment” did increase the likelihood that a youth would have been arrested for a property offence., For violent offending, neither pre/perinatal complications alone nor coming from a disadvantaged family environment alone was of predictive value.  However, youths who had both pre/perinatal complications and came from a disadvantaged family environment were approximately twice as likely to have engaged in violent offending as youths who had one or neither of these disadvantages., Conclusion. This study demonstrated that within an already disadvantaged group (inner-city black youth), biological complications combined with a disadvantaged family environment increased the likelihood that these children would be arrested for a crime of violence.  More optimistically, however, it should be remembered that an intervention that either reduced the likelihood of early biological complications or provided a more supportive family environment would appear likely to reduce future violence.  Things that happen early in a child’s life – even before birth – can, in combination with later factors, affect how violent the child turns out to be. The health care system can play an important role in reducing crime., Reference: Piquero, Alex and Stephen Tibbetts.  The impact of pre/perinatal disturbances and disadvantaged familial environment in predicting criminal offending.  Studies on Crime and Crime Prevention,  8 (1),  1999, 52-70., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV2N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-2-no-5-%E2%80%93-september-1999,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 2, No. 5 – September 1999",Regular Issue,1999
"The so-called “New York Miracle” -- the large decline in homicides that took place in the early-mid 1990s was not as unusual as some have suggested.  In fact, it is made up of two quite different trends: a slow and steady decline in non-gun homicides and a big decrease (after a large increase) in gun homicides.  Simple explanations do not fit the data.",", In searching for an explanation for the drop in homicides in New York from 1991 to 1996, the single most important fact to keep in mind is that there are actually two trends., In other words, masked by the large increase and equally large decrease in gun homicides, there has been a large decrease, for a long time, in non-gun homicides. The data are inconsistent with the suggestion that there was simply a shift from non-gun to gun homicides., Any attempt to explain the drop in homicides in New York (1991-96, a 51% drop) must take into account the following facts:, When one looks to possible explanations, the data suggest the following:, What can be concluded?, Reference: Fagan, Jeffrey, Franklin E.

"Highly violent nations differ from nations with low levels of violence in at least five ways.  Violent nations are high on social disorganization, economic inequality, neglect of children, officially approved violence, and corruption or inefficiency of the criminal justice system.",", Background.  Most attempts to understand cross-national crime rate differences have looked at large numbers of countries and tried, by using statistical techniques, to understand what factors differentiate high- from low-crime countries. These have problems largely in terms of the quality and comparability of the data.  Even the measures used – typically homicide rates – have problems including such things as whether attempted homicides are included, and the adequacy of the data gathering and recording system in the country. Furthermore, when there are internal conflicts (as in Rwanda in 1994), it is hard to know how to estimate a homicide rate., This study examined only those countries where there were adequate data on the economic, political and social situation in the country and where there was a reasonable level of agreement (from at least two sources) that indicated that the country was “low or high on violent crime relative to most other nations in the same geographic region” (p.261). Six high and six low violent crime countries (two each from Africa, South America, and Asia) are compared., Five dimensions appeared to differentiate between high and low crime countries:, Conclusion. It is clear that the level of violence in a society is not an “accident.”  Factors that vary within a large country and factors that affect portions of a country’s population also have an impact at the national level. Countries that, are likely to be low in violence., Reference: Neapolitan, Jerome L.  A comparative analysis of nations with low and high levels of violent crime.

"Three factors have apparently contributed to a decline in intimate partner homicides:  fewer long-term intimate relationships, improved economic status of women,  and a growth in domestic violence resources.   But the benefits flow largely to males: fewer women kill their male partners.","The Context. Killings that involve intimate partners have been declining in the United States during the past several decades. It has been well established that the death of an intimate at the hands of a partner is commonly the culmination of ongoing violence in a relationship. Thus, research suggests that factors that facilitate exit from a violent relationship or inhibit the development of such relationships should reduce the rate of intimate partner homicide by a simple mechanism – the reduction of exposure to a violent partner. Research on domestic violence research has also demonstrated that victim precipitation is common in cases where women kill their intimate partners, whereas it is unusual when men kill their female partners. Moreover, intimate violence is far more likely to result in serious bodily injury of the woman than the man. These findings are crucial to understanding the effects of exposure reduction factors on male and female intimate partner homicide victimization., This study examined the contribution of three exposure reduction factors (i.e. decline in long-term intimate relationships, the improved economic status of women, growth in domestic violence resources) on the decline in intimate partner homicide rates. The authors hypothesized that exposure reduction would have a larger impact on the rate at which women kill their partners than on the rate at which men kill their partners. This is a result of women’s greater risk of serious injury from domestic violence and, in turn, their more active search for ways to reduce or escape this violence. The analysis was based on a panel data set of 29 large U.S. cities for four periods, spanning 1976-1992. Various exposure reduction factors were examined for their effects on rates of male and female intimate partner homicides. Measures of domestic violence services included the presence of hotlines, counseling services, legal advocacy programs and shelter availability. The rate of marriage and rate of divorce for each city and time period were included to capture declines in long-term intimate relationships. Finally, two measures of the economic status of women were included: relative educational attainment and sex differences in earnings., The Results. Each of the three factors contributed to the reduction in the intimate partner homicide rate, most prominently to the rate at which women killed their male partners. Domesticity, as measured by marriage and divorce rates, was found to be related to the rate of spousal homicide: the greater the marriage rate, the higher the rates of both husband- and wife-perpetrated homicide whereas a high divorce rate reduced the rate at which wives killed their husbands. As expected, the declining marital rate was also associated with an increase in the rate of unmarried males killing their partners. The analysis also showed that the improved educational status of women was associated with a reduction in the rate at which females killed their unmarried partners. Finally, there was a statistically stable and negative impact of hotlines and legal services on the rate at which wives killed their husbands., Conclusions. From a policy perspective, these results suggest that an important criterion for evaluating policies meant to prevent violence among intimates is the extent to which they reduce exposure in violent relationships. However, it is important to recognize that these exposure reduction factors vary for males and females. The benefits of exposure reduction in this study arose primarily from averting male victimization with little evidence found for exposure reduction effects on the female victimization rate. Other approaches must be found for reducing male-perpetrated intimate homicide., Reference: Dugan, L., Nagin, D.S., & Rosenfeld, R. (1999).

Why does the U.S. incarcerate so many people?  It is the unique combination of  “American moralism” and the structure of American government that appears to be the most plausible explanation.,", Background.  U.S. imprisonment rates (668 per 100 thousand in mid-1998) are unprecedented in American history or in other western democracies.   The rates, of course, are consistent with harsh U.S. policies such as the death penalty, life-without-the-possibility-of-parole laws,  extensive mandatory sentencing laws, and strict guidelines.  The U.S. has not always been like this: in the 1930s U.S. incarceration rates were comparable to those of many European countries., Examining the explanations.  Two explanations that have been offered which do not, on their own,  account adequately for this phenomenon:
High U.S. crime rates. For the most common crimes (property crimes) U.S. rates do not appear to be higher than those of most major western countries.  Where the U.S. stands out is in firearms violence, but these, numerically, cannot account for prison populations. Crime trends -- increasing recorded violence rates beginning in the early 1960s -- parallel increasing prison populations in the U.S. but not in other countries (e.g., Finland or Germany (p. 423-4)).  Unlike other countries, American politicians chose deterrence and incapacitation as strategies to address the crime rate, but these strategies “were adopted long after crime rates began to fall” (p. 422).
The U.S. public wants harsher penalties.  The research in the U.S. mirrors that in Canada: “ordinary people have the same complex and ambivalent attitudes to criminals that judges and lawyers do...”(p.424).  More importantly, “public support for harsh laws typically follow[s], not precede[s], media and political preoccupation with crime” (p.425)., Partisan politics has moved “crime” from the status of a difficult, but unglamorous, public problem to the centre of partisan politics: crime policy (along with welfare and affirmative action policies) became useful issues for defining differences between parties.   Crime policy became crude sound-bite slogans presented in “simplistic and emotional terms” (p.427).  As a consequence, crime policy became a metaphor “for broad concepts like personal responsibility...” (p.428).  The “right” won (and the left has tried to recapture the territory by “out-righting the right”)., The federal government’s role has expanded directly and indirectly into social policy arenas and many of these new roles have not constituted conspicuous successes. Confidence in government decreased, allegiances were formed on the basis of single political issues, and, as a result, “policy initiatives that command the broadest support -- such as harsh crime, welfare, and immigration policies -- are understandably important to elected politicians.... Harsh policies on crime and welfare can be debated in moral terms, respond to broad-based anxieties and empathies, and affront no powerful constituency” (p. 430)., Historical trends in crime rates in many western countries rise and fall independent of crime control policies.  Presently, they are falling.  However, harsh policies (e.g., drug policies) appear after the problem (e.g., drug use) has started declining.  This is understandable, in part, because decline in drug use may follow acceptance of the destructive or “moral” concerns about drugs (or crime).  Few political leaders are willing to argue against policies aimed at reducing immorality.   Similarly, now that crime is seen as a moral (individual responsibility) issue rather than an issue of social disadvantage, few will speak out against punishing the immoral.  In addition, whether the policies “work” or not is unimportant:  harsh approaches (to crime, welfare, immigration, etc.) are favoured by politicians and (subsequently) the public because these policies define and locate the problem in a particular personal and moral space., Reference: Tonry, Michael.  Why are U.S. incarceration rates so high?  Crime and Delinquency, 1999, 45¸ 419-437., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV2N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-2-no-6-%E2%80%93-november-1999,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 2, No. 6 – November 1999",Regular Issue,1999
"Three strikes laws have had no impact on crime levels.  More surprisingly, they have generally had little impact on the criminal justice system largely because they represented, to a great extent, more symbolic than real changes.  Even in California, projected impacts were much less than expected.  The major impact was predictable: prosecutors have increased their control over the criminal justice process.",", Background.  Three-strikes legislation has taken America by storm.  Even Canada has its own “little-3-strikes” provision in the proposed Youth Criminal Justice Act -- three strikes and you’re presumptively an adult (for sentencing purposes).  The U.S. laws vary considerably (p. 134-6) on what constitutes the first two strikes, and what offences can be considered a third strike.  Finally, the consequences of being “out” vary across states. Critics suggested that the legislation would have an enormous impact on the criminal justice system; supporters suggested that the legislation would reduce crime.  Neither occurred., The general finding in most states was that the law had little impact for a simple predictable reason: “the vast majority of the targeted offender population was already serving long prison terms for these types of crimes... The three strikes law movement is much ado about nothing and is having virtually no impact on current sentencing practices” (p. 142)., California is the exception.  California is unique in the baseball justice world because its “third strike” can be any felony.  It also created an unusually harsh second strike provision and courts have decided, among other things, that certain juvenile adjudications can count as strikes (p.144).    Although the law explicitly prohibits plea bargaining, it allows the prosecutor to “discount a prior conviction...” if the prosecutor believes that a baseball sentence would not be “in the furtherance of justice” (p. 143).  Nevertheless, there have been some interesting 3-strikes sentences including:
27 years to life (to be served in prison) for attempting to sell stolen batteries (value $90). 
Minimum of 5 years (to be served) for selling $5 worth of marijuana. 
25 years to life (to be served in prison) for, after failing to stop at a stop sign, failing to stop when the police tried to stop the offender.  A chase occurred but there was no accident and no injuries except to the car’s tires which were shot out by the police., The law had an impact initially on the number of preliminary hearings, though this increase did not last long.  Trial rates for second and third strike cases are dramatically higher (4% of non-strike felony cases go to trial compared to 9% for second strike and 41% for 3rd. strike cases) but there are few 2nd. and 3rd. strike cases.  Counties varied dramatically on how strictly they implemented baseball sentencing.  Some (e.g., San Francisco) discounted baseball penalties for those charged with non-violent offences.  Generally speaking, crime went down in California as elsewhere in the U.S. and the decrease was uncorrelated with the zeal in implementing baseball justice.  The impact on prison populations was much less than initially projected, though there were about 10,000 baseball sentenced offenders admitted to prison each year, and the prison population increased between spring ‘94 (the first inning) and spring ‘98 by almost 30,000 (about 27%).   Because of the uneven implementation, however, this was dramatically less than had been projected.  Judges, it seemed, also tended to undercut the impact of baseball sentencing (p.152)., Crime, of course, was unaffected by the changes in the law. Those states with and without baseball sentencing and those counties in California which embraced or did not embrace baseball sentencing are indistinguishable when looking at crime rates., Conclusion: Baseball sentencing rules have symbolic impact but have less impact than originally thought on criminal justice processing.  They have no impact on crime.  They can, however, “enlarge the discretionary powers -- and hence sentencing powers -- of the prosecutor at the expense of the judge” (p. 158)., Reference: Austin, James, John Clark, Patricia Hardyman, and D.

The method of supervising drug abusers on parole can make a difference: Social support programs which addressed the needs of the parolee combined with drug testing created better results than routine parole (with or without frequent drug testing).,", Background.  Drug abusers are often seen as being poor candidates for community corrections programs because of fears that their addictions will lead them (back) into criminal behaviour.  Given that they do eventually return to the community, the question that should be asked is what can be done to maximize the likelihood that they will live a peaceful and drug free life?, This paper reports a study in which offenders with a history of narcotic addiction and/or heavy cocaine use were randomly assigned to one of three parole supervision conditions: routine parole (where urine testing for drugs occurred infrequently), routine parole with weekly drug-use monitoring, and intensive social support combined with weekly drug-use monitoring.  This involved, among other things, identifying the needs of the parolees and helping to link parolees with available services in the community., The results -- on such measures as parole violations, re-arrests, re-convictions --  were clear: social support along with drug testing was superior to drug testing alone (p. 173).  Furthermore, within the “routine parole” condition, some parolees obviously received treatment.  The outcomes for this group were more favourable than for those who received no treatment during their parole., When one looks at “drug use” as an outcome measure, however, the results are somewhat different since the groups were differentially tested.  Nevertheless, the results are clear: the more one looks for drugs the more one finds.  Hence “combining monitoring with counseling can be problematic.... If... positive results lead to termination of counseling and/or incarceration... urine monitoring can undermine the objective of maintaining clients in treatment as long as possible” (p. 176)., Conclusion. Measures aimed at addressing the needs of parolees with a history of substance abuse clearly can be effective in reducing the likelihood of offending.  More generally, however, this study demonstrates that how one supervises those on release from prison can be just as important as who is being released and supervised.  A releasing authority, such as a parole board, truly interested in “managing” risk would, therefore, examine carefully what it can do to help reintegrate a prisoner into society.  It would not limit its attention, when considering release, solely to the characteristics of the prisoner before it., Reference: Hanlon, Thomas E., David N.

"Doing crime or having contact with the criminal justice system as a young person has long-term harmful effects.  Above and beyond any background factors (SES, family structure, race, cognitive skills, etc.) “delinquency in adolescence… reduces educational and occupational attainment in young adulthood especially among males” (p. 269).",", Background.  What happens to delinquents when they grow up?  Most young people commit offences and a fair number of them become caught up in the youth justice system.  When they stop committing offences, does their “delinquent background” hurt them in other ways?  Most research that looks at school or occupational attainment has examined individual, family,  cultural, or attitudinal variation in young people as predictors of  who succeeds and who does not., This paper looks at delinquent experiences as a possible impediment to later success.  Specifically, using an American longitudinal sample of youth who were 14-17 in 1979, it examines educational and employment outcomes for those interviewed in 1990-92 when they were 25-30 years old.  A number of variables – family socio-economic status, family size and structure, race, a cognitive skills measure (at age 14-17), and educational expectations when an adolescent – were controlled for statistically. Delinquency at age 14-17 was measured by self-reported drug use, involvement in property crime or violence, or contact with the criminal justice system., For males, controlling for background and educational measures (cognitive skills and educational expectations), being delinquent in adolescence was associated with a lower likelihood of graduating from high school or getting a university degree as well as lower occupational status and a higher likelihood of being unemployed at age 25-30., For females, it appeared that being delinquent as a youth had little direct effect on occupational achievement at age 25-30, but instead hindered educational attainment.  Being delinquent as a youth had no impact on female unemployment at age 25-30., Conclusion: “Delinquency in adolescence… reduces educational and occupational attainment in young adulthood, especially among males… for ‘ordinary kids’ as well as their more disadvantaged counterparts” (p. 269).  These findings “testify to the importance of avoiding trouble when young: early deviance, both directly and indirectly has lingering effects that negatively influence life chances…. [The findings] cast doubt on the notion of benign or innocuous wrong-doings” (p. 269).   Of course, “responses to delinquency may have an effect on life course trajectories…. Research indicates that adults who are officially identified and processed as criminals find it harder than other job seekers to secure employment” (p. 270).   Hence, although we do not know exactly why deviance has the impact it does, these findings suggest that the impact of  “doing crime” or being caught for it can have long term consequences., Reference: Tanner, Julian, Scott Davies, and Bill O’Grady.  Whatever happened to yesterday’s rebels?

Young people are blamed for more crime than they really do. One reason is that young people are more likely to be caught.,", Background.  Each year in the U.S. (and to a lesser extent in Canada) when crime statistics are released, people look at the proportion of those arrested who are juveniles.  When the proportion of arrested people who are juveniles is high, the assumption is that juveniles are responsible for a high proportion of crime.  For example, in the U.S. when the 1997 FBI statistics were released, the fact that 30% of those arrested for robbery were juveniles was interpreted as meaning that 30% of the robberies were committed by juveniles.  This ignores the fact that fewer than 20% of robberies are “cleared”, and, therefore, in most robberies there are no arrests., This paper demonstrates that inferences about who commits crime based on who is arrested for it are likely to be wrong.  There are reasons to believe that juveniles are more likely to be caught than adults: they are less experienced and they are more likely than adults to commit offences in groups.  Law enforcement personnel may also be more motivated to locate and arrest juveniles., This study examined robbery data from 7 American states, and used “incident based” data where victims’ perceptions of the age of the offenders were recorded. Compared to incidents apparently involving adult offenders, those involving juvenile offenders were:, A more sophisticated analysis showed that “controlling for other incident characteristics, these data find that juvenile robbery offenders are 32% more likely to be arrested than are adult robbery offenders” (p. 157).   In addition, the presence of a weapon increased a juvenile robber’s probability of arrest, but not that of an adult.  “This is consistent with the national concern surrounding kids and guns…. [However] the relative seriousness of the offence is less of an issue when handling juvenile offenders.  If these biases reflect the attitudes of the public at large, not only are juveniles more likely than adults to be arrested for similar crimes, but juvenile crimes may be reported to law enforcement [agencies] at a higher rate.  This would add to the distortion of the juvenile crime component of crime that flows from law enforcement data” (p. 160)., Conclusion: “Based on these analyses, both juvenile arrest and clearance statistics over-represent the juvenile responsibility for robbery in the United States….  This bias may have increased in recent years as a result of the intense national focus on juvenile violence and the related increase in law enforcement attention to juvenile violent crime” (p. 160).  More generally, the study demonstrates how cautious one has to be in interpreting reports of crime or arrests as they are contained in official records of crime., Reference: Snyder, Howard.  The overrepresentation of juvenile crime proportions in robbery clearance statistics.  Journal of Quantitative Criminology,  1999, 15,  151-161., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV2N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-2-no-6-%E2%80%93-november-1999,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 2, No. 6 – November 1999",Regular Issue,1999
"Why do demographers predict that there will soon be a demographically driven crime wave?  Two reasons: they don’t look at the data, and they don’t understand crime.  Data do not support the notion that crime rates will increase because of changes in the age distribution.",", Background. Demographic determinists in Canada and the U.S. have suggested that because of an increase in the number of children just entering the adolescent years, “the next crime wave will get so bad that it will make 1995 look like the good old days” (p. 582).   The problem with such predictions is that they are based on an assessment of a single variable: the number of  people of crime prone years.  They do not take into account two things: projected increases in the size of the overall population (thus not taking into account the size of the denominator in calculating crime rates) and they do not take into account age specific crime rates and changes in these rates., This paper attempts to divide “changes in crime rates into two parts: that which is attributable to shifts in the age structure and that due to all other sources of variation” (p. 585).    When this is done, one starts with,  for example, the fact that U.S. murder rates rose, from 1960-1980 from 5.08 to 10.22 per 100,000 in the population. This was the period, of course, when the baby-boomers aged into the crime prone years.  However, only about 20% of this increase is attributable to changes in the age structure.  Looking at age-specific rates, one finds that if age-specific crime rates had stayed the same, the U.S. murder rate would have increased during these 20 years only from 5.08 to 6.08 per 100,000 in the population., The results of this analysis demonstrate that “changes in the age structure through 2010 will work very weakly in favour of lower crime in stark  contrast to the frequently made assertion that the United States is in the beginning stages of a demographically driven crime wave” (p. 592).   The experience in recent years of dramatic changes in the age-specific crime rates of certain groups suggests that it is these changes that are much more important in understanding changes in overall crime rates.   Social programs which have an impact on  the level of involvement in crime of those entering the crime-prone years are, obviously, much more important than the shifts in the age structure of our society., Reference:  Levitt, Steven D.  The limited role of changing age structure in explaining aggregate crime rates.  Criminology, 1999, 37 (3), 581-597., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV2N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-2-no-6-%E2%80%93-november-1999,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 2, No. 6 – November 1999",Regular Issue,1999
People are generally not good at determining whether suspects are lying when they are being interrogated about crimes.  More serious is the fact that formal training in detecting liars makes people less accurate.,", Context. Statements made by accused people during police interrogations are obviously very important determinants of what happens to them and how a police investigation proceeds.   Police are often trained not only in interrogation techniques,  but also in how to detect whether a suspect is telling the truth.  Surprisingly, there are few studies evaluating the usefulness of such training., This study took 8 undergraduates and got them to agree to “commit” one of four “crimes.”  For all practical purposes, these were real crimes: the only difference was that all of those involved knew that it was part of an experiment.  Eight other undergraduates did similar, but innocent, acts.  Interrogations were then carried out and these interrogations were videotaped.  These tapes -- of “offenders” and innocent people -- were then shown to other people.  Half of these other “observers” had been given training in “the Reid technique” of detecting deception (from verbal and  non-verbal cues) and half had not., The results were quite straightforward.  Thirteen of the 16 suspects in the study assumed that the interrogator would be able to judge them accurately as being “guilty” or “innocent” as the case may be.   The overall level of accuracy was at chance level: flipping a coin would have been just as effective in determining whether a “suspect” was “guilty” or “innocent.”    However, the untrained observers were slightly, but statistically significantly,  more accurate (56%) than the observers who had received one of the standard police training packages.   Nonetheless, although they were more often wrong than not, the “trained” observers were able to cite more reasons for their decisions.  These findings are not unusual: other studies as well have shown that people are not good at detecting liars and that training does not significantly improve their ability.  Part of the problem in the real setting is that “research shows that police officers hold the same erroneous beliefs as laypersons do about the verbal and nonverbal indicators of truth and deception…. [and that] even professionals who regularly make such judgements for a living, such as detectives…, are highly prone to error” (p. 511).  “In this vein, it is important to keep in mind that police and other experienced law enforcement professionals have not outperformed novices in related past studies” (p.513)., Conclusion.  The problems inherent in any interrogation are increased dramatically because interrogators are not good at determining whether suspects are telling the truth.  This paper demonstrates that training does not help interrogators determine whether the truth was told. Indeed such training may provide the interrogator with convincing “reasons” for believing or disbelieving a suspect unrelated to whether the suspect is telling the truth.  In short,  this paper reminds us of how easy it is for erroneous judgements to have devastating impacts on the way in which a police investigation proceeds., Reference: Kassin, Saul M. and Christina T.

Don’t be fooled:  Judges are not a major cause of crime,"Beware of simple correlational relationships. It would be easy to show, in any province, that the more judges there are living or working  in a town, the more crime takes place.  This is likely to be true whether one looks cross-sectionally (i.e., at different places at one point in time) or longitudinally (i.e., looking at the changes in the number of judges and the amount of crime over some period of time at one or more locations).  Few, however, would jump to the conclusion that judges cause crime., This report looks at crime (measured both by victimization surveys and by way of police reports) and the operation of the justice system in the United States and in England and Wales (“England” for short).  There are two sets of findings that have received public notice. First, for crimes other than murder, England tends to have rates as high as, or higher than, the United States.  There are problems with the comparisons in that different measuring systems have been used, but nevertheless, the conclusion of the report is clear. (The problems with comparisons are described in detail in the methodological sections of the report.)  The second finding is that the trends in crime and “punishment” (or the reaction to crime) in the two countries are different.  By juxtaposing crime trends and punishment trends in two countries, the obvious question is implied: are crime trends affected by punishment trends?   These are not the ideal data to answer this question.  Nevertheless, the report raises the question, and in this “review” we will focus, largely, on this issue., Crime patterns and criminal justice policies have changed in the past two decades in England and in the United States. And they have changed in different directions.  The United States has tended to favour intensive criminal justice processing, whereas England has tended to favour more selective prosecution of crime, diverting relatively minor offenders out of the system and attempting, somewhat inconsistently, to develop punishments in the community and to limit the use of imprisonment.  Crime patterns have also varied in the two countries.  Murder rates in England have been low and unchanged since 1981. American rates look more like a roller coaster: going down in the early 1980s, up in the late 1980s and then down again since 1991.   Comparing other specific crime rates across countries is problematic.  Looking at robbery, for example, police statistics suggest that firearms were used in 5% of English robberies and 41% of U.S. robberies.  Nevertheless, this report does compare the crime levels in these two countries across time and one conclusion appears to have caught the imagination of the mass media.  As one of the authors is quoted in news reports as saying, “With rising punitiveness in the U.S., crime rates are falling.  In England, there is less punitiveness and crime rates are rising” (London Telegraph and Washington Post).  The data in the report are not that simple., One must be very careful about statements such as the one quoted in the previous paragraph. Let us look at the summary the authors prepared on the issue of the “Justice system’s impact on crime” (p. 38): “Negative correlations in England between trends in punishment risk and crime trends offer the strongest support for the theory that links falling risk of punishment to rising crime.  Specifically, since 1981 the conviction rate fell in England and English crime rates... rose.... Likewise, the incarceration rate fell, and English crime rates... rose....” (p. 38, middle column).  Statements such as these would seem to imply that failure to incarcerate people caused crime to rise (see p. 28 for “graphic” evidence that “incarceration rates” fell in England (and went up in the U.S.)., There is more to the term “incarceration rates” than meets the eye.  The term “incarceration rate” does not mean the rate at which convicted offenders are put in prison. Thus, before we can compare England and the U.S., a rather simple question needs to be asked: “What do the authors mean by the term incarceration rate?    They are clear in what they mean, but the full definition is on page 62, in the “Notes on figures 43-48.”   Incarceration rate turns out to be quite simple for most crimes. It is “the number of incarcerated persons per 1000 alleged offenders [which was] obtained by dividing the number of juveniles and adults sentenced to incarceration for the specified crime during the year... by the number of persons committing the crime [taken from police reports of crime, whether or not the offender was apprehended]... that year” (emphasis added).    Incarceration rates are going “down” in England.  But look carefully:  in order for a person to be incarcerated, the offender has to be apprehended, and convicted, and, finally, sentenced to prison.    What if apprehension rates decreased, or conviction rates decreased, but the rate at which convicted offenders went to prison stayed the same?  The answer is simple, the “incarceration rate” will go down.  The authors present changes in “conviction” rate and, not surprisingly, in England they tend to go down (see figures on page 18).  Remember, however, that these do not necessarily reflect “failed” prosecutions.  These data are “convictions per 1000 offenders” (apprehended or not).  Failure to apprehend can lead, obviously, to failure to convict.  But so can criminal justice policy.  If minor offenders are apprehended but not prosecuted in the courts, and instead are dealt with in the community, there will be a decrease in “convictions” (and, consequently, a decrease in both the “conviction rate” and the  “incarceration rate”).   Using this type of definition, a successful diversion program -- where many minor offenders are diverted into programs that might, even, reduce recidivism, would lead to a “lower conviction rate” and a “lower incarceration rate.”, Do other measures or punitiveness show the same pattern? Let us look at other measures of  changes in punitiveness.   These are conveniently presented on page 22 of the report.  They show essentially no change in the likelihood that a convicted offender will be sentenced to incarceration.  What they tend to show is that for property offences, the U.S. incarcerates more.    But the court based incarceration rates -- the probability that a convicted offender will go to prison is essentially unchanged.   And if one is interested in the “average incarceration sentence imposed on convicted offenders” one finds (page 30) that, if anything, these tended to go up in both countries (or they stayed the same). Finally, the percent of time served “is generally about the same in the U.S. and England”  (p. 35) and the changes over time are small and inconsistent (see figures on page 34).  So the inferences about “crime going up as punishment risk goes down” have nothing to do with punishment as meted out by the courts. If you are interested in sentencing policy, go elsewhere., Let’s go back one more stop: We do not really know what makes up the “conviction” rate.  It is obviously partly a function of apprehension rate, and partly decisions to prosecute in the courts, and partly how successful a prosecution is in obtaining a conviction for that offence.  But clearly the data in England -- higher crime going with “less punitiveness” -- has nothing  to do with sentencing or sentencing policy., What about the U.S.?  The inference that “increased punitiveness” is associated with lower crime rates is challenged by referring to the authors’ own words: “correlations between punishment severity and crime trends were mixed (Table 2, p. 39).  Approximately half were positive [more punitiveness, more crime] and half were negative [more punitiveness, less crime].  Moreover, in instances where there were negative correlations, they were often weak.  Furthermore... correlations between punishment severity and [victimization] survey crime rates often had a different sign than correlations between severity and police-recorded rates for the same crime.  In short, trends in punishment severity had an inconsistent relationship with trends in crime in the U.S.”  [They then point out that there was some consistency for burglary, but provide no explanation as to why there was “consistency” on this one offence and not others.], What do these findings mean in the context of general deterrence literature?.  Most criminologists would never look to a report such as this one to understand the deterrent impact of criminal justice processing generally, let alone sentencing. Crime is a complex phenomenon and looking at two sets of measures (“crime” measures and “punishment” measures) in isolation of all other factors and then inferring a causal link is just about as logical as suggesting that judges cause crime because there is more crime where there are more judges.  There is nothing inherently wrong with the data in this report, just as there would be nothing wrong with counting crime and judges in various parts of Canada and relating the two measures.   The manner in which they were obtained and processed is described carefully, largely in the “methodology” section of the report.  But one has to read the notes that go with each figure carefully to understand what the data and the analyses mean., The risk to an offender of committing an offence.  Let’s look at one final measure --  “Days of incarceration an offender risks serving.”  Again, the figures showing that these are generally going up in the U.S. and are unchanged or doing down in England are presented on page 36, but the explanation of what these data mean is put on page 63:  “‘Days of incarceration an offender risks serving’ were obtained by multiplying the probability of conviction given an offence... by the probability of incarceration given conviction and by the average number of days served per incarceration sentence...”  In other words, let us assume that there are 1000 burglaries in England and that about 60% of these are reported to the police (see page 8) and that the police “record” about 40% of these (page 10).   Not everyone gets apprehended.  In fact, most do not, and some of these who are apprehended are found not guilty.   Some are also diverted into community programs.  The result is that there are about 8 burglary convictions per 1000 alleged burglars in England (page 18).   About 40% of those convicted (see page 22) are incarcerated.  The report suggests that there are only about 2 burglars incarcerated per 1000 alleged burglars (page  28).  Those two valiant burglars who make it this far in the process are each sentenced to about 12 months  (page 30) and each serves about 6 months (page 32).   In other words, for 1000 burglaries, 12 person-months (365 days) are served, the authors argue.  Hence, the “days of incarceration a burglar risks serving” is less than one, or roughly 365/1000 days or 0.4 days (p. 36). But this is meaningless since the “days of incarceration a burglar risks serving” largely reflects the fact that most burglars are not apprehended., When the data are examined like this, it is clear that changes in sentencing are more or less irrelevant.  But beware of crafty statistics: this report suggests that in England the “number of months served per offender” for murder is 52.2 (or slightly over 4 years) for 1995.  Any reasonable, but criminal justice naive person, would think that this means that people only serve a bit more than 4 years for murder. This is wrong. Some offenders are not apprehended; others are found guilty of other offences.  Still others commit suicide after committing murder. But they are part of the calculation of the “number of months served per offender.”  Yet even this figure is somewhat different from the 230 month “incarceration length given on average”  (calculated in terms of how long, on average people serve before being released or dying in prison; page 95).   Both of these figures ignore one rather important fact, “In England, a life sentence... is mandatory for murder.” (p. 59).   Those released from prison for homicide served, on average, 13.6 years or 163 months (p. 60)., The bored reader of this report might be interested in looking at the U.S. homicide sentencing calculations in this report.  There is a serious problem in U.S. homicides: how does the researcher deal with people who, in fact, do serve life sentences and, therefore, die in prison. For the U.S. data, the authors seem to have considered this problem (p. 56) in their calculations. They estimated the time actually served before death. Thus, it appears that if people lived longer before dying in prison (or presumably before being executed) the “number of months served per offender” in the U.S. would be higher.   It does not appear that this is a very useful statistic since, among other things, it would go “down” as the efficiency of capital punishment goes up., Conclusion.  In a report which received a lot of media attention, statistics can be found suggesting that more “punishment” is associated with “less crime.”   This is true only if one is willing to be selective in which statistics one looks at, and if one defines “punishment” in terms of  the likelihood that someone who offends (and may or may not be apprehended and charged)  will be punished by a court (i.e., not the likelihood that a convicted offender will receive a harsh penalty).  In other words, this report presents no convincing evidence that increasing state imposed penalties will reduce crime.   To quote the authors, once again, “In England, correlations between punishment severity and crime trends were mixed. Roughly half were positive [more punishment, more crime] and half were negative [more punishment, less crime].... In the United States correlations between punishment severity and crime trends were mixed.  Approximately half were positive and half were negative” (p. 38).  Judges are not a major cause of crime.  Nor is “punishment” policy.  Then how does the English Sunday Times manage to conclude that “The report appears to be a vindication of tough American policies such as “zero tolerance” policing, “three strikes and you’re out”, which sends repeat offenders to jail for life, and frequent use of custodial sentences.”   Go figure., Full reference: Langan, Patrick A. and David P.

"Selective incapacitation is found, one more time, to be ineffective and wasteful of resources",", Background.  The view that “crime control” interests can be served effectively by locking away in prison those offenders who commit serious violent offences is intuitively attractive. After all, if they are locked up, they cannot commit offences.  Hence some argue that incapacitation strategies are “certain” to be effective.  In a logical sense, if a person is locked up, that inmate will not be committing offences in the community.  The question, however, is whether it is an efficient and sensible strategy., This study uses New Zealand data to examine the effectiveness of sentencing strategies that differentiate between “serious violent offenders” and “other offenders.” In New Zealand, as in many other jurisdictions, a policy was developed to attempt to incapacitate “serious violent offenders.” The study looks at 613 offenders who were released from prison in 1986 in New Zealand.  They were retrospectively classified as being “serious violent offenders” or “other offenders” on the basis of their offences of conviction.  They were then followed after release.  The New Zealand “incapacitation” strategy operated largely on the basis of denial of parole., The results of this study that are most damaging to those who favour an incapacitation strategy for dealing with crime come from an examination of re-offending after release. The study found that “those who would now be classified as serious offenders were no more likely [after release] to receive a further conviction... and were in fact significantly less likely to be re-imprisoned...” (p. 713-4).   Furthermore, “Of all serious offences committed at offenders’ first post-release conviction, 92% were committed by those imprisoned for ordinary offences” (p. 714).  Put differently, “30 of the 613 offenders in the sample committed a serious offence within 2.5 years of release from prison, just three of whom were originally imprisoned for an offence of that sort” (p. 714)., Three other incapacitation models were then examined, including a multivariate prediction model.   None were very good.  Part of the problem is that the “base rate” of serious offending is (thankfully) low. There are few very serious offences committed by anyone.  This automatically makes accurate prediction difficult.  The accuracy of these prediction models, however,  “while improved over present offence based classifications, remains low overall” (p. 720).  The models tended to identify many non-serious offenders as “serious offenders.” In one model, for example, 26 offenders were accurately identified as being serious offenders, but 271 were identified as serious when in fact they turned out not to be. At the same time 21 people who turned out to be serious offenders were not identified as such.   The reason for the failure of the incapacitation in this instance and in other research is easy to understand: “offence specialization is much rarer than commonly thought” (p. 722). In other words, there is not an identifiable group of people who “do” serious offences.  Serious offences tend to be committed rarely, but when they are, they are not necessarily committed by those who have done them in the past., Conclusion: In this study, as in many others, the “obvious” strategy of reducing crime by incapacitating serious offenders is shown to have two ineffective effects: people who would not otherwise commit serious crimes are kept in prison and people who are not predicted to commit serious offences are released.  Mechanical approaches to incapacitation -- such as three strikes laws -- do not, therefore, reduce crime and, in fact, waste valuable resources., Reference: Brown, Mark.

Determinate sentencing laws (and the abolition of discretionary parole) do not necessarily have any impact on prison populations or levels of crime: They affect the nature and size of the punishments people get for crimes but do not necessarily have any other effects.,", Background. It does not take much thought to realize that changes in sentencing practice and changes in release procedures can affect prison populations.  In the past two decades in the U.S., there have been two notable criminal justice trends: prison populations have increased dramatically and various states and the federal government have brought in determinate (sometimes guideline based) sentencing policies often along with the abolition of discretionary parole.  However, “there is nothing inherent in determinant sentencing laws (DSLs) that would lead one to expect prison populations to grow or decline” (p. 109).  Different U.S. jurisdictions have clearly had different goals when they brought in DSLs. Some wanted to affect crime, some wanted to reduce disparity in sentencing, some wanted to contain prison populations. Others were looking for combinations of these goals., This study uses a “multiple time-series design [using] 10 states as ‘natural laboratories’” and compares effects (prison populations, crime levels) to the other states.  Various measures of crime, prison populations, etc., are used., The results show no consistent effect.  For some states, the number of prison sentences went up and in others they went down.  The impacts of prison populations were predominantly in the negative direction.  The introduction of DSLs in some states (Minnesota and Washington) reduced prison populations, but in at least one state (Indiana) DSLs were associated with an increase.  There were no consistent effects on crime rates., Conclusion. “The determinant sentencing laws cannot be blamed for any of the nationwide growth of prison populations, despite many opinions otherwise, and they may even be a moderating force.”  It appears to be the case that “the two DSLs with sentencing guidelines... and the only two that order prison capacity to be taken into account when setting sentencing levels” are the ones where prison populations were reduced.... [The authors found] little to suggest that DSLs affect crime rates...” (p. 122). The authors note that “for those states considering new DSLs, we conclude that the laws are unlikely to worsen prison overcrowding problems unless they are accompanied by a strong get-tough policy, and lawmakers can use DSLs to limit prison population growth if they so desire.  The laws are not likely to affect crime rates appreciably” (p. 123)., Reference: Marvell, Thomas     B. and Moody, Carlisle E.  Determinate sentencing and abolishing parole: The long-term impacts on prisons and crime.

Juvenile justice in the U.S. is in the midst of major changes.  At the moment it is moving in the direction of slow abolition of the juvenile court.  There are other options to examine if a distinction between youth and adults is to be maintained.,", Context.  Public opinion polls in the U.S., read simply, suggest that two thirds of Americans think that kids under 13 years old who are charged with murder should be tried as adults.  This is not an unusual finding. Research in Canada [Sprott, Crime and Delinquency, July 1998] suggests that they may “say” this, but when it comes down to individual cases, people are not so punitive.   But the U.S. juvenile court -- with its welfare orientation -- may wither away on its own: decreases in funding for programs, and high probation caseloads limit the ability of the courts to intervene., Legal changes in many states are also having important effects on the juvenile court. The most dramatic, one might argue, are the changes making it easier to try a youth charged with an offence in adult court.  The number of judicial decisions to try a youth in adult court has gone up by about 40% in the past ten years.  But the big changes are “automatic” transfers where youths charged with specific offences are automatically dealt with in adult court, and laws allowing prosecutors to determine the venue of the court hearing.  Between these changes and increases in the severity of sanctions in the juvenile court, nearly every state has (since 1992) enacted laws treating youths like adults. [One estimate suggests that as many as 200,000 youths under age 18 are tried in adult courts in the U.S.  The comparable figure for Canada would be roughly 100 youths per year tried in adult court.], This paper suggests that the juvenile court in the U.S. is doomed since it is rapidly becoming a “scaled-down, second-class, criminal court.”   The authors suggest that the way to maintain courts that accept the reality that youth are not the same as adults is to develop specialized alternative courts to deal with special problems. A range of these already exist in the U.S. (e.g., drug courts, gun courts, or various alternative dispute resolution systems).  The suggestion is that court intake procedures which are typically already in place (which resemble Canadian post-charge alternative measures decision processes) could be used to stream cases into a range of different types of “court-like” institutions  which would be closer to the community and which would address underlying problems more directly., As the authors suggest, the central issue is “what happens to young people following arrest” not whether they are called delinquents or criminals.  They argue that the U.S. must consider possibilities other than the “all” (juvenile court as it is) or “nothing” (all youth in adult court) approaches to youth justice., Conclusion. Juvenile justice programs are in flux in most of the U.S., as well as in Canada, parts of Australia, England, Japan, and South Africa, to name just a few countries.  This paper suggests that instead of focusing solely on “where” youth are adjudicated, and whether youth are deemed to be adults or are allowed to remain youth, we should focus more on the type of system we want for particular kinds of offences. Such an approach may be less politically complex and may focus attention more on issues related to desired outcomes., Reference:  Butts, Jeffrey A. and Adele V. Harrell.

"The public wants tougher laws to deal with violent and repeat juvenile offenders, doesn’t it? No, not really.",", Background. The United States Congress apparently is interested in passing laws to show the public that it takes crime committed by youth seriously.  A Senate bill, introduced by two prominent Republicans, would, among other things, allow youth to be imprisoned along with adults, make juvenile records available to colleges that the youth might apply to later in life, provide funds for prison construction, and give federal prosecutors sole discretion to decide whether those youth charged with offences would be tried as adults or as youth., This paper provides survey results from February 1998 on a representative sample of U.S. adults designed to determine what level of support there is for the various provisions of the bill.  The results suggest that “tough” may be “good” in the abstract, but when it comes down to specific provisions, “tough” doesn’t sound so good., The results show that the American public:, One may well hear statements that we should be “tough on crime” but when it comes down to particular ways in which this might be done, people seem more pragmatic than tough.  Canadian data on this are quite similar.  See, for example, Sprott [Crime and Delinquency, July 1998] and Doob, A. N., J.B. Sprott, V. Marinos, and K. N. Varma  [An exploration of Ontario residents’ views of crime and the criminal justice system. Centre of Criminology, 1998]., Conclusion. Just because people say that they want to be “tough” on youth crime does not mean that these same people will endorse “tough” strategies.  This survey, carried out on a nationally representative sample of Americans, suggests that “tough” federal standards for the youth justice system are not endorsed by the majority of American citizens.  We suspect, based on other work (See Doob et al. cited above), that people are more interested in effective proposals., Reference: Schiraldi, Vincent and Mark Soler.

"People differ on how they view crime: some see crimes as varying in how “morally wrong” each crime is; others tend to see crimes as being equally morally wrong, even when the crimes are quite different from one another. This latter group of people tend to identify themselves as “conservative Protestants.”",", Context. Survey data in the U.S. has identified a group of people “who did not discriminate among crimes on their perceived wrongfulness” (p. 454).   Knowing that such a group exists and are identifiable may help us understand public responses to various crime policies.  Various Government of Canada policy statements, for example, differentiate among crimes -- and suggest a more severe response to “more serious” crimes.  If, on the other hand, all crimes are seen as equally reprehensible, such policies may not receive support.  And, in the context of this paper, particular groups may differ from others on this dimension., This paper examined public attitudes in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in 1993.  Respondents to a survey were asked to “indicate how morally wrong [they thought] it was for a person to commit [each of 12 of crimes]” such as shoplifting, breaking into a house and stealing a television, robbing a store and killing two employees, etc.  Separate measures were also obtained of “conservative Protestantism” and of more general “religiosity.”  “Conservative Protestantism” was operationalized largely in terms of a literal interpretation of events and ideas from the Bible (page 456)., The findings were clear: Those who were most likely to believe in a literal interpretation of the Bible (High on the scale of conservative Protestantism) were most likely to rate the average severity of the 12 crimes very high, but, more importantly, were less likely to differentiate among the different crimes., Conclusion:  An identifiable group of people -- who, typically, would be described as fundamentalist Protestants -- view crime in different ways from others. First they see crime, generally, as being more morally wrong than others see it. Second, they tend not differentiate among crimes: All crimes are equally “wrong.”   Other data suggest that this same group believes that sins (which include crimes, presumably) deserve punishment, and they believe in “punishment as retribution, rather than for deterrence or rehabilitation” (p. 462). “This movement represents a shift away from the previous paradigm of rehabilitation, deterrence, and crime prevention through social programs and it presents lengthy incapacitation of criminals (all of them) as the alternative.  This message has an appealing ring for a public weary of crime and skeptical of past liberal rehabilitative efforts, as well as for politicians who are eager to exploit fears of crime and who advocate retributive solutions for the crime problem” (p. 462).  “Manifestations of increased punitiveness, such as mandatory sentences... and the ‘three strikes and you’re out’ provisions, can be understood as stemming from the successes of the conservative Protestant social movements, which has operated to form public opinion and to influence lawmaking” (p. 462-3)., Reference.

"Why do unsuccessful policies persist even though they have failed? Probably because the policies are linked to the moral or symbolic role that these policies play. In other words, failure of a policy such as being tough on crime or drugs is not necessarily a relevant dimension in understanding the persistence of the policy.",", Background.  In criminal justice, it is easy to find policies that persist, even though they do not seem to work.  In the U.S., policies to increase the use of punishment, the death penalty, and punitive approaches to drugs can all be cited as examples.  This essay explores the attachment to ineffective policies in the context of a review of two recent books on drug policies. Policies obviously have to be understood within the social and cultural context in which they exist.  The persistence of “ineffective” policies, then, may be explained by understanding what other “functions” these policies serve., U.S. drug policy, which follows a punitive or prohibition model, has clearly failed if drug use, and drug-related problems, are the focus.  Serious drug use in the U.S. does not seem to have declined. The U.S. drug policy is seen as having failed for three reasons: (1) the “profit paradox” -- drug enforcement efforts increase drug prices which has the effect of increasing drug profits to those who are successful at it. It is estimated that “drug organizations” can lose 70-80% of their product and still be successful.  (2) The “hydra effect” -- attempts to stamp out drug production tend, only, to shift its location. (3) The “punish to deter fallacy.” In the area of drugs, it appears to be even less likely than in other domains that punishment deters use.   The “drug war” also has negative effects (e.g., exacerbating health problems, focusing punishment on the poor and on ethnic and racial minorities)., The U.S.  drug war is, of course, a relatively recent phenomenon, having its origins in the first 20 years of this century.  Other countries did not join the war, but U.S. policy appears to have been guided in part by the “anti-vice” crusaders.  A more “medical” or harm-reduction approach where the medical profession might have been important did not develop.   In fact, when “treatment” became prominent in the 1960-70s, it was seen as a “useful adjunct to punishment” (p. 232).  Drugs were seen as not only dangerous but as being morally wrong., The failures of punitive responses to drugs appear to be explained as failures of the political will rather than as approaches which were doomed to failure.  The suggestion is made that “more punishment” would be effective if only it were used. Moderates are often trapped in a game of who can “out-tough” the other.  Drug use is made out to be a personal, moral weakness.  Abstinence is seen as the only legitimate goal and anything less than this is seen to reflect moral weakness. Hence the focus of the drug policy on “dangerous classes” reinforces this view. The problem is that “The power of the drug war paradigm means that discussion of real alternatives rarely occurs” (p. 236).   Hence “harm reduction” approaches like those popular in Europe never get much attention., The authors of one of the books reviewed here reject simple “legalization” as a realistic alternative, though it is pointed out (p. 237) that there are a range of different forms of legalization that are possible.  They prefer a “public health” approach where “drug use [is seen] as a public not an individual problem -- one that can be caused and exacerbated by social conditions.. and one that has social consequences...” (p. 238).   However, they point out that “no policy paradigm can take root unless it finds fertile soil in already-existing patterns of thought” (p. 238).  In the U.S., there has, historically, been some support for the “public health movement” though this approach has been fought quite successfully by organizations like the American Medical Association that preferred to see health as an individual, not state, responsibility., A public health approach would focus largely on discouraging “any use of the most dangerous drugs” and, generally, would focus on reducing harm to society as a whole.  Law enforcement “would no longer be the keystone of drug policy but merely an adjunct to generally nonpunitive policy” (p. 239).   The authors point out that there are a number of “once avid drug warriors who now reject the prohibition model” (p. 239).  Such changes might set the scene for what is necessary: a “major paradigmatic shift.”  This, they suggest, will only come from pressure from people, not from politicians, and will come if there is pressure to adopt a “politics of reason, care, and collective responsibility” (p. 239)., Reference: Ryan, Kevin F.

"If the U.S. had not successfully banned the (Canadian) Film Board film Drug Addict, made with the assistance of the R.C.M.P. in 1946, it is possible that the U.S. might not have successfully entrenched (forever?) its punitive drug policies. The “drug czar” of the time was successful in controlling public access to views that challenged the war on drugs.",", Cast of characters: Alfred Lindesmith (an American sociologist, an early opponent of a punitive approach to drugs) and   Harry Anslinger (Head of the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics who acted as one of the early soldiers in the U.S. War on Drugs)., Background: The U.S. Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) was unsuccessfully challenged by an American academic, Alfred Lindesmith, a University of Indiana sociologist, for two decades (from 1939 until the early 1960s).  The FBN was obviously concerned about Lindesmith in that it began a campaign in 1939,  soon after Lindesmith first was employed at the University of Indiana,  to get him fired.  Lindesmith criticized, in a 1940 article,  “stereotyped misinformation about drug addicts such as news stories of the ‘dope-crazed’ killer or the ‘dope fiend rapist’” (p. 668). This article “so angered Harry Anslinger [head of the FBN] that he arranged to have an attack on Lindesmith published in the same journal. The FBN sponsored article “associated the spread of addiction with Japanese imperialism as well as a variety of crimes....  As if this were not enough to attempt to discredit medical treatment of addicts, even nudism was associated with drug addiction.  [The judge who had been recruited to write the response] concluded that Lindesmith was a ‘pseudo-scientist’” (p. 668)., The Canadian connection to this story surrounds an award winning 1946 documentary made by the Film Board, “with the assistance of the narcotics specialists in the RCMP” (p. 670). In Canada, the film was cited as being a “bold, honest record of the drug traffic and its toll in human misery.  It is as honest as it is stark.  The film treats drug addiction as an illness and thus has run afoul of some who would condemn as criminals all who use drugs” (p. 670).  The U.S. response was somewhat different: the FBN arranged for it to be banned.  The film’s message was unacceptable since it suggested that (p. 670-1):, The FBN first asked Canada not to distribute the film in the U.S. and then asked Canada to censor the film.  It even requested that the Canadian government not allow Lindesmith to view the film while he was visiting Canada.  Canada refused.  But the effect was that the film could not be seen in the U.S., though it was unclear exactly who was responsible for imposing the ban., Technically, the film is still banned in the U.S. and, of course, its message -- which many drug researchers would still endorse -- is in conflict with current U.S. drug policy.  More importantly, the forces that successfully suppressed the message of the film (and Lindesmith) were successful in their long term policy goals.   The authors suggest that “The [Canadian] film, in hindsight appeared to be the last and best chance to create a rational and humane policy on narcotics...  Had Lindesmith been more successful in opposing the ban, it is conceivable that punitive drug policies would not have become firmly entrenched in [U.S.] laws.” (p. 681-2)., Conclusion. The repressive approach to drug problems in the U.S. is not new, nor is opposition to it a new phenomenon. When there has been vocal opposition to a repressive approach, U.S. officials have responded forcefully and successfully to the challenge. A punitive approach has persisted in the U.S. notwithstanding influences from north of the border which could have resulted in different approaches.  The banning of a 1946 (Canadian) film board production on drugs was certainly symptomatic of the American approach and may have been important in understanding the persistence of U.S. drug policy., Reference: Galliher, John F., David P.

"Restoring order to one of the worst and most unpleasant facilities in New York City -- the Port Authority Bus Terminal -- was accomplished largely through changes in design and management rather than with criminal justice muscle.  Zero tolerance, in this case, meant not tolerating bad design and poor management and addressing problems as they arose.","Context. The Port Authority bus terminal is the biggest bus station in the world, handling about 175 thousand passengers a day.  A block away from the prostitutes, porn and drugs inTimes Square, it was also the home of “several hundred” homeless people.  The homeless had taken over most public areas in the building such that facilities designed for bus travelers were no longer available for them. The goal was to reduce crime (largely robbery, assaults, and thefts), and to deal effectively with the problems of the homeless, drugs, prostitution, etc., Approach.  The Port Authority (PA) police were incapable of taking control by “normal” police approaches.  Although the PA police force is large (it is the 28th largest police force in the U.S.) with 125 officers assigned permanently to the bus terminal, they, alone, could do little.  Other approaches had to be used.  Instead of seeing the problem as being dealt with by way of “law enforcement” and, for example,  arresting or harassing transients in the bus terminal, the PA contracted with a social service agency to provide services to “their” transient population. The police, then, induced transients to cooperate with the agency by providing the alternatives of accepting help, leaving, or going to jail. The transient problem was made manageable., Physical modifications were also important.  Entrances and exits were made more accessible.  Niches and dark corners were eliminated.  Areas where people could hide or sleep without being observed were made into public spaces by turning brick walls into glass walls.  Benches where people had slept were removed and replaced with single seats that were made purposefully uncomfortable to sleep on.  Information kiosks were set up to make it easy for visitors to get legitimate information rather than being victimized by various types of hustlers.   Stores -- particularly chain stores that people felt comfortable patronizing -- were brought in.  Video games that attracted young toughs were replaced with games that problematic folk were uninterested in. Physical changes facilitated the “flow” of people quickly and easily through the station, thereby reducing the opportunity for them to be victimized., Results. Complaints went down. Ratings of various aspects of the terminal went up. There were 80% fewer homeless in the facility. Public order complaints were reduced dramatically as were the numbers of most offences.  People felt more safe and saw the police as doing a better job. Only about a third as many people said that they felt insecure or very insecure in the PA terminal after the changes had been implemented as compared to before. Declines in crime had been occurring in New York (as well as other parts of the United States, and in Canada) at the time that the PA bus station was being cleaned up (beginning in 1991), but decreases were larger in the PA bus station than in the surrounding areas.   Equally important is the fact that “there was no evidence of displacement of robbery to nearby precincts.”, Conclusion.  “Combining physical design and clever management, the Port Authority has brought its transient problem under substantial control and reduced its crime problem.”  Some of the design changes were rather mundane: they made 14 design changes in the washrooms which, in total, helped reclaim the washrooms for use by bus station users.  Perhaps what is most interesting is that crime, disorder, and unpleasantness were reduced dramatically without resorting to hard line police tactics.  Crime was designed and managed away., Reference.

Transferring youths into adult court does not lead to an overall reduction in their future offending.,", From at least as early as 1965, Canadian government reports on the treatment of young people who commit criminal offences suggested that the institutional commitment of youths should be held to a minimum. Nevertheless, it was not until the late 1990s that the decarceration of youths became a reality., In 1994, Canada’s Minister of Justice announced in Parliament that Canada’s youth justice laws had been unsuccessful in one of their important goals — reducing imprisonment. This acknowledgement began a legal and cultural process that would have a dramatic impact on youth incarceration. First, two national reviews of youth justice were held. Second, a policy paper was released that suggested a completely new youth justice law. Third, a new law was introduced into Parliament in 1999, coming into force 4 years later. By that time, those working in youth justice had been trained in a new way of thinking about the appropriate way to respond to offending by youths. And by differentiating violent cases from all other cases – suggesting, implicitly, that violent cases might be dealt with harshly – public opposition to the new approach was minimized., More importantly, perhaps, the ‘aspirational tone’ of previous youth legislation and policy (e.g., the use of incarceration should be minimized where appropriate) was replaced by more restrictive or directive language (e.g., custody can only be imposed if one of a number of fairly clearly defined conditions are met)., Youth incarceration rates began to decline in the late 1990s. The most dramatic decline, however, took place when Canada’s new youth justice legislation came into place in early 2003 (see Criminological Highlights 10(3)#1). What is perhaps more surprising is that sentenced custody rates for youths continued to decline in the years following the new legislation. “The most parsimonious explanation [for this latter decline] is that the new youth justice culture in Canada became increasingly more firmly entrenched or implanted” (p. 1112). The data demonstrate reductions at all stages of youth justice processing between 1998 and 2015: fewer incidents (especially non-violent incidents) were reported to the police; a smaller proportion of reported incidents resulted in charges; a lower proportion of cases in court resulted in findings of guilt; and a smaller proportion of those cases with a guilty finding resulted in a custodial sentence., Canadian governments have produced numerous reports suggesting that Canada imprisons too many adults and, indeed, Canadian legislation has aspirational language suggesting that imprisonment should be used as a last resort for adults. Similarly, in 2012, Canada introduced new language into its youth law in an apparent attempt to reduce the use of pretrial detention for youths. Notably, neither attempt was successful in part because they used “aspirational” rather than “operational” language; there was little attempt to change the (administrative) approach used by those working in the justice system; and governments appeared more ambivalent about what they wanted to accomplish in these areas., Conclusion: The dramatic reduction of youths in sentenced custody in Canada occurred as a result of at least three conditions: (1) Restraint in the use of incarceration was firmly embedded in Canadian criminal justice values; (2) There was clear political willingness to support change, and (3) The law was crafted to reduce the use of court and custody by explicitly structuring decisions through prescriptive provisions. It would appear that “Change is possible as long as we have the will to make it happen” (p. 1128)., Reference: Webster, Cheryl Marie, Jane B. Sprott, and Anthony N. Doob (2019).

"Wealthy and powerful people are less likely to commit homicide because they have greater access to legal ways of handling conflict.  Those without access to legal remedies (the poor, the disadvantaged, etc.)  must handle conflicts themselves, increasing the likelihood of lethal violence.",", Context. There is much evidence to suggest that homicides are concentrated among the poorest in a society.  For example, aboriginal people in Canada -- both on and off reserves -- are much more likely than other Canadians to be victims or offenders in homicide incidents. However, it appears that in “premodern” societies, “homicide was found at all levels of the social hierarchy, including its higher echelons” (p. 381).  Understanding what changed may help us understand something about the use of violence more generally., This paper relies largely on an analysis of the role of law in an earlier paper (by Donald Black) that suggests that much of crime is best thought of as “a form of aggressive conflict management, or as it is sometimes known in the anthropological literature, ‘self help.’ Although violence is an accepted method for pursuing grievances in many societies, states define it as a crime.... [Black suggested] that within state societies some groups occupy stateless locations in social space....  Low status people... are largely outside the state’s legal system and hence are more likely to use aggressive tactics to resolve their conflict...  Thus one factor that appears to predict homicide is virtual statelessness, or the effective unavailability of law” (p. 393)., On the other hand, in many western countries, most calls to the police come from the poor and disadvantaged, and many of these calls involve interpersonal disputes.  These findings are not in conflict with this perspective since the poor, disadvantaged, or marginalized, may simply invoke the law “less readily than other people, and when they do, they less often receive from it the help they want” (p. 393).  “In sum, law is differentially distributed across status groups.  Because law is relatively unavailable to low-status groups, they cannot rely on it to settle their disputes and so homicide comes to fill some of the void left by its absence” (p. 395)., “[In] societies in which the state has evolved to being itself of high status, the protection of the law allows high status people to abjure lethal conflict.  Those at the lower echelons of society do not enjoy the same luxury, however.  For them, law is... a distant and repressive system.  Because law is effectively unavailable, low-status people must handle conflicts themselves, thereby increasing the likelihood of lethal violence” (p. 397)., Implications. This is an important theory which gives a reasonable account of why violence (or what is labeled as “crime” more generally) is not evenly distributed across classes in society.  It also has clear policy implications: if “legal” approaches to dealing with disputes are not available to all people (and are not seen as effective, fair, etc.), other means of resolving disputes will be used., References.

"California’s “3-Strikes” law strikes out again.  Strike One: Its effect on crime through incapacitation will be minimal.  Strike Two:  If fully implemented, the increase in  prison costs in the state will be roughly equivalent to the state’s current post-secondary education budget.  This study throws Strike Three: it will not deter crime.",", Context.  California’s three strikes law created mandatory 25 years to life sentences for those convicted, for the third time, of any felony (after two prior convictions for serious crimes).  It also increased dramatically the sentence for the second strike. One might expect such well publicized mandatory sentences to deter crime.  A previous study by the RAND Corporation looked at incapacitation effects and costs (Strikes One and Two against this law). This study, looks at the other presumed benefit from harsh sentences: general deterrence., This study.  Using month-by-month data from California’s ten largest cities, the authors looked at the impact of the new law on felonies (which, presumably, should be given an extra dose of deterrence by the 3-strikes law) before and after the change in the law.  And, as a form of comparison, the authors looked at reported misdemeanour larcenies which, presumably would be unaffected by the three strikes law., Results.  The results are easy to describe: “The results generally indicate that the three-strikes law did not decrease the California Crime Index [a crime rate based on the rate of reported “index” crimes] below that expected on the basis of preexisting trends” (p. 464). It is important to look at preexisting trends since crime in California, as elsewhere in North America, was going down before the three strikes law came into being.  This is important to remember, given that one often hears about simple “before vs. after” comparisons when examining issues such as this one.  If crime was already going down before the three strikes law came in, one cannot logically attribute the drop in crime to the law.  [In one city -- Anaheim -- there was a significant decrease in the crime index not attributable to preexisting trends.  There is no explanation related to the three strikes laws that might explain this one effect in isolation from the other nine cities. The best guess is that something quite different was responsible for the apparent drop in this one city.], One explanation for the lack of deterrent impact of the law is the obvious one: sentences were already pretty harsh in California.  Second, those generally in the position of committing a third strike were getting a little too old to be committing crimes anyway.  A law that attempted to deter or incapacitate people when they were at the point of naturally retiring from a life of crime cannot have much impact., Conclusion.  California’s three strikes law does not deter.  In nine of the ten largest California cities there was no measurable impact on the law beyond what was happening anyway before the law came into being.  There seems to be no reasonable explanation related to the three strikes law for the data from the tenth city (Anaheim). There are simple explanations for why the law had no deterrent impact.  More important is the implication of these findings for any attempt to deter through harsher legislative minimum sentences.  The California three strikes law received enormous publicity and was well known to most people since it was voted on in a state-wide initiative.  Since it had no discernible deterrent effect, one cannot plausibly expect other legislative minimum sentences in any country to have an impact on crime., Reference: Stolzenberg, Lisa and Stewart J.

The desire for tougher laws in the U.S. relates more to factors such as the public’s belief in the decline of morality and increases in the diversity of the population than it does to perceptions of fear and risk.,", Background.  There are two broad, but not mutually exclusive, ways in which punitiveness within the general population might be explained.  
It is possible that people are punitive because they believe that punitive approaches to wrongdoing will create a safer and more secure society.  Punitiveness, if this view is correct,  should be linked to views about crime and to fear. 
In addition, people may be punitive because they feel the need to reassert social values and to re-establish the obligation to obey the law.  Punitiveness, then, would be linked to social values -- such as judgements about the cohesiveness of society and views of the family., This paper.  This was a relatively small scale (166 respondents) survey in Northern California.  Although the survey size was small, and the location was quite specific, the respondents appear to be a reasonably representative sample of adults in this area.  Furthermore, and most importantly, the respondents were diverse in terms of education, race, etc., The authors used, as their measure of punitiveness,  support for California’s Three Strikes law, some measures of “overall punitiveness” and respondents’ “willingness to abandon procedural protections” in the criminal law., They also obtained measures of people’s views about crime, the courts, whether their neighbourhood and state are cohesive and caring, as well as measures of whether they feel traditional family values have disappeared and the acceptance of diversity in their state.   Finally, measures of authoritarianism and dogmatism were obtained., Findings.  The findings are somewhat complex, but the following results were quite clear:
Support for three strikes,  support for general punitive policies, and willingness to abandon procedural protections were all reasonably related to one another.
Authoritarianism and dogmatism were strong predictors of support for the three strikes initiative, support for general punitive policies, and the willingness to abandon procedural protections.  
Other concerns about social conditions -- especially the view that traditional family values have disappeared -- predict support for all three types of punitive responses (3-strikes, general punitiveness, no procedural safeguards).
Above and beyond these concerns, crime-related concerns at best have a modest relationship with punitive responses., Conclusion. We tend to explain views about crime by looking to crime-related beliefs and attitudes.  This paper argues that such an approach is not sufficient. Social values, and views of the community and the family are, according to this study, more important in explaining punitive attitudes.  When we hear members of the Reform Party, for example, arguing for certain punitive policies, we must look beyond the Reformer’s views of crime for an explanation.  Their punitive views may be related, much more strongly, to their broadly based views that their communities and their country have deteriorated morally., Reference.  Tyler, Tom R. and Robert J.

The analysis of the relationship between IQ and crime presented by Herrnstein and Murray in their book The Bell Curve is seriously flawed: A careful analysis of the data demonstrates that the size of the relationship between IQ and crime is trivial and is much less important than many factors that society can change.,", Context.  The best-selling book by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray -- The Bell Curve (1994) suggests that “IQ has a powerful and largely immutable effect across a range of behaviours” including crime.  Herrnstein and Murray use data from the American National Longitudinal Study of Youth.  What they failed to do was to control adequately for other causes of crime which could have been controlled for using the data that they used for their analysis., This study takes a more thorough approach to the analysis of the relationship between IQ and crime using the very same data used by Herrnstein and Murray.  These authors demonstrate that the effect of IQ on crime becomes insignificant when a full set of known causes of crime is taken into account.  The authors of this paper note that Herrnstein and Murray are not politically stupid: Herrnstein and Murray “controlled for” one variable (socio-economic status) as if that was the only relevant variable.  That way it looked as if they had “controlled for” social factors when, in fact, they had barely begun to do so., The more complete model suggests that various factors known to be manipulable (e.g., various attitudes and values) are much more important than IQ in understanding crime., Studies of the relative importance of IQ among a large number of other “risk factors” for crime suggests that it is almost invariably one of the least important factors.  One analysis of the published literature suggests, for example, that of 34 factors related to crime, 30 different factors are more important than IQ.  Various “attitudes, values, beliefs, and behaviours (e.g., having delinquent associates) that support an antisocial lifestyle” are much more important than IQ.   And these kinds of factors are “dynamic in nature; that is,  they can change and,  thus, are amenable to correctional treatment.  This reality contravenes the bell curve paradigm put forth by Herrnstein and Murray” (p. 399)., Conclusion.  A careful empirical analysis -- using the very same data that Herrnstein and Murray used -- demonstrates the empirical inadequacy of Herrnstein and Murray’s contention that IQ is an important factor in explaining crime. Quite simply, Herrnstein and Murray presented an inadequate analysis of the data.  The authors of this paper demonstrate that “the effects of IQ on criminal involvement are, at best, modest...  [The data show] that IQ is a weak to modest risk factor in offending and its criminogenic effects are dwarfed by a range of factors, many of which are amenable to change.... Herrnstein and Murray’s policies to control crime, especially among the cognitively disadvantaged, have virtually no empirical support and, on their face, are certainly preposterous” (p. 388-389)., Reference.

Persistent young offenders typically commit the same kinds of offences as other young offenders -- only more of them.  Who qualifies as “persistent” is arbitrary and those identified by one definition at one point in time would not be the same people identified as “persistent” if the definition or time period were slightly changed.,", , Context.  The idea that a “small number of offenders” is responsible for a disproportionate amount of (youth) crime has become a meaningless truism of criminal justice culture.  For example, one can honestly say that in 1995-1996, 2.6% of youth in Canada are responsible for 90% of the cases brought to youth court.  Similarly, one can honestly point out that in 1995-6, 46 youths in Canada were responsible for ninety percent of the homicides that took place apparently at the hands of youth.  Both of these statements are, essentially,  meaningless.  There were 111,027 cases brought to court (involving 67,681 persons); these youths are 2.83% of all youths in Canada.  There were 51 youths charged with homicide in Canada; 46 youths constitutes 90% of these 51. On the other hand, offending, like many human activities is not evenly distributed across the population. Hence we have the search for the magic sign which identifies “persistent offenders” who could then be incapacitated or treated., This book reports a study of all of those youths who were arrested three or more times in two parts of England.  Starting with this population of youths, three definitions of “persistence” were applied to the pool of 531 youths who had been arrested three times in a year (number of arrests, number of offences attributed to them, number of offences known to have been committed by them). An attempt was made to identify the 10% most persistent youthful offenders.  The only problem was that 69 different youths were identified by one or more of these criteria, but only 30 of these 69 were identified by all three criteria., As the authors point out, “These are the juveniles in whom the police, the courts, the press and the public are particularly interested” (p. 101).  The offences they were doing were the same as other juveniles: just more of them: “It is not the case that these persistent offenders were committing the more violent or serious offences....” (p. 102), It was also noted that if one looked at persistence over time, and one used as a measure of persistence “frequency of known and alleged offending over a three month period”, those who would be defined as persistent varied across time: “It was rare for [offenders] who met the criteria in each quarter to be the same individuals” (p. 103 ).   “Offending, particularly persistent offending by juveniles, is a relatively transitory activity” (p. 105).  But the overwhelming finding bears repeating: “Persistent offenders... -- whichever of the three definitions was used -- did not seem to be strikingly different from the full sample, with the tautological exception of the frequency of their offending” (p. 119).  “Very serious offences -- grievous bodily harm, aggravated burglary, rape and sexual offences -- did not represent in total as much as one percent of all offenses attributed to persistent young offenders -- a pattern that is typical of juvenile offending generally” (p. 120).  “Any definition of persistence will inevitably be arbitrary” (p. 122). “In summary, then, not only is the process of attempting to define persistence deeply problematic, but because there is a degree of arbitrariness in the way some offenders rather than others become defined as persistent, creating a custodial sentence for that group raises issues both about equity and about efficient resource use”  (p. 123)., Conclusion.  We cannot reliably identify who is likely to be a persistent offender.  Definitions can be created and applied, but equally reasonably sounding definitions would identify a different group of offenders.  Persistent young offenders -- by any definition -- may have committed more offences, but the offences that they commit, on average, are no more serious than the offences committed by others.   A special regime for such offenders may look good as long as one does not look carefully at the effects., Reference:  Hagell, Ann and Tim Newburn.

The reason that the sons born of adolescent mothers are more likely to commit criminal acts than are the sons born of older mothers is a combination of two factors: the lack of resources of these families and the fact that the mothers seem to lack parenting skills or provide poor role models to their offspring.,", , Background.  Although it is relatively well established that children of adolescent mothers are at risk on a number of different dimensions (including crime), it is less well understood why this might be the case.  This study draws on data from a longitudinal study of 411 boys born in 1952-3 who have been followed since they were 8-9 years old.   The age of their parents (and other siblings) was collected, and the boys have been followed up until age 32.  Their total (official) criminal record is known -- 36% had at least one criminal conviction., Explanations for the link between being born of a young mother and criminality.  There are three non-exclusive explanations that might be given for this link:, The researchers looked at the age of the mother at the birth of her first child as well as her age when the child who was being studied was born (who may or may not have been her first child)., Results. Women who give birth early are more likely to have delinquent kids.  But at even higher risk of becoming delinquent are children whose mother was over 20 when they were born and whose mother had given birth to another child when she was an adolescent.  Such mothers seem to be especially lacking in parenting skills and also are lacking in resources for caring for their children.  Hence there was support for the second and third of the explanations listed above, but not the first. Data are presented demonstrating that various “persistent poor parenting characteristics” and measures of “diminished resources” are more likely to be associated with children of mothers who have their first child early than they are associated with children who are born of mothers whose first child was born after age 20. There are, obviously, limitations of this study that need to be considered.  First, it was carried out (in England) on a group of disadvantaged kids who were born in the 1950s.  Second, the range of environmental and social variables (e.g., material and non-material support) examined was limited., At the same time, however, it does suggest that there is a need to intervene in support of mothers who have children early.  Obviously, resources (financial and otherwise) can be helpful. Support, advice, help, and training in child rearing matters would appear to be important for the eventual well-being of these children who are “at risk.”, Conclusion. This study suggests that “problem behaviours [such as crime] associated with children of adolescent mothers seem to be rooted in the more enduring circumstances and behaviours emphasized in the poor parenting-role model and diminished resources…” (p. 158)., Reference.  Nagin, Daniel S.,  G.

Why is the unemployment rate in the U.S.A. so much lower than the rates in most European countries and Canada?  It’s because the “surplus labour” is in prison.  “The dramatic increase in the U.S. prison and jail population has made U.S. unemployment rates look lower than they would be otherwise” -- U.S. unemployment rates would jump by about 2% if their (unemployed) prison population were considered part of the work force.,"The denominator of most unemployment rate calculations is the size of the work force: those employed and those unemployed (and looking for work). The numerator is those not employed.   Another group who might have preferred to be in the work force are those in prison: they are neither employed nor unemployed.  For the purposes of unemployment rate calculations, they simply do not exist.  Adding them to the numerator and denominator would increase U.S. unemployment figures by roughly two percent., As long as rates of imprisonment are kept low, this does not create much of a distortion.  This paper suggests that (using 1990 data) the difference between “conventional” and “adjusted” (considering prisoners as an unemployed part of the work force) unemployment rates for most European countries is about 0.1 to 0.3%.  In other words, if prisoners were to be considered to be “unemployed” in a conventional way, the European unemployment figures would increase by very little.  In contrast, using 1990 figures for the U.S. (when there were “only” 1.1 million in jails and prison in that country),  adjusting the unemployment rate to take into account the number of unemployed prisoners would increase the U.S. unemployment rate by about 1.5%.   By 1994, if prisoners were counted, the male unemployment rate should be adjusted upwards by about 2 percentage points., The impact of counting prison populations when calculating unemployment figures is dramatic in the U.S. (but not other countries) for a simple reason: the ratio of unemployed to imprisoned residents in the U.S. is much lower compared to most countries.  Using 1990 figures, in the U.S. there is one prisoner for every 3.5 unemployed persons.  In Europe in 1990,  the ratios were quite different: Germany has one prisoner for every 19.5 unemployed people; France has one prisoner for every 20.9 unemployed;  Denmark one prisoner for every 35.8 unemployed., As the authors point out, if prisoners were counted “These modified estimates suggest that unemployment in the economically buoyant period of the mid-1990s was about 8 percent -- higher than any conventional U.S. unemployment rate since the recession of the early 1980s” (page 11)., The effect of prison on unemployment rates is, of course, not equally felt.  Blacks and males (and black males in particular) contribute most to these figures.  And, in the long term, those who are incarcerated have a lifetime expectation of being less likely to work.  In a U.S. national longitudinal study it was found that “even after 15 years, [survey respondents] who were incarcerated as juveniles worked between 5 and 10 percentage points less than did their counterparts who did not experience incarceration” (page 12)., Conclusion.  The data are quite clear.  A good proportion of the difference in unemployment rates between the U.S. and other countries like Canada comes as a result of the imprisonment policy in the U.S.   Prisons not only separate offenders from society, but they can also distort unemployment figures.  In the long run, however, one of the (presumably) unintended effects of a high imprisonment policy for youth and adults is that a group of chronically unemployed people are created., Reference.

When a community has a labour surplus -- a relatively high unemployment rate -- the frequency of imprisonment goes up.  This is true even when other factors are controlled for.,", The relationship between unemployment and crime is complex -- but the relationship between unemployment and the use of imprisonment turns out to be fairly straightforward.  In this study, carried out in the U.S., it was found that counties that had high unemployment rates tended also to have high imprisonment rates., This study chose the county as the unit of analysis because, as the authors put it, “punishment policies generally are made at federal and state levels, but punishment is dispensed normally by local prosecutors and judges” (p. 360).  The authors point out that “increasing anxiety and resentment in the ranks of criminal justice may... contribute to harsher punishment during economic downturns and times of rising unemployment....  [Criminal justice officials] find new merit in the notion that severe penalties are needed to counteract the heightened temptations of illicit activity caused by hard times.  The widespread beliefs that unemployment causes crime and severe punishment acts as a deterrent to crime underlie an increasing proportion of their decisions.  Day-to-day they do what they can to increase the odds that crime does not become an alternative to economic hardship.  The end result of their countless individual decisions is increased severity of punishment” (p. 359).  Other studies have shown that “for individual defendants, judicial decisions to incarcerate vary significantly by employment status...  Judges apparently view steady employment as an indicator of stability and unemployment as a sign of future trouble” (p. 359)., This study looked at 269 counties in the U.S. where adequate data could be obtained. It found that changes in imprisonment (commitments to prison) between 1980 and 1990 in these counties related to certain predictable factors: changes in the rate of violent crime and changes in the proportions of young males in the county.  Other factors (e.g., income, racial composition, property crime rates) were also controlled for statistically.  But over and above these factors,  “change in unemployment is an independently significant predictor of change in imprisonment” (p. 364)., Conclusion.  Communities where unemployment has risen appear to “adjust” their punishment practices so that levels of imprisonment also go up.  The paper does not suggest that such a “policy” is explicitly understood by those implementing it.  What is clear, however, is that above and beyond standard factors known to relate to crime, unemployment is an important factor in explaining high prison rates., Reference:  Hochstetler, Andrew L. and Neal Shover.  Street crime, labor surplus, and criminal punishment, 1980-1990.  Social Problems, August 1997, Vol. 44 (3), 358-367., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV1N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-1-no-4-%E2%80%93-march-1998,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 1, No. 4 – March 1998",Regular Issue,1998
Watching television news makes people -- particularly middle-aged white women -- more afraid.  This is most likely to be due to the “affinity of audience members with victims most often seen on television news.”,", Context.  For Canada and the U.S., the mid-to-late 1990s have been punctuated with moral panics about crime.  Just as things seem to be calming down, an unusual or brutal crime will occur somewhere, and the cycle of  crime-blame-punitiveness starts again.  In the U.S. in 1993, the national “news” magazines (Time, Newsweek, etc.) all featured crime stories.  By late that year television and newspaper news coverage of crime in the U.S. had increased by about 400% in a six month period and the number of Americans ranking crime or violence as the nation’s most important problem increased from 9% (in January 1993) to 49% (in January 1994) according to polls conducted by the Gallup organization., This study, using data from a 1994 household survey in Tallahassee, Florida, operationalized fear as respondents’ estimates of the likelihood that they would be the victim of a robbery, assault, or burglary., Findings.  Fear in this study was related to the variables that have been found in other studies: fear was generally higher for older people, females, those who think that their own neighbourhoods (or the country, generally) have high crime rates and those who feel less safe in their own homes.  For the purpose of this study, however, TV news watching (and radio news) were both significant predictors of fear above and beyond these other variables., What is probably most important about this study is that the effects of media coverage of crime did not seem to be uniform: the effect appeared to be confined to particular groups of people: women, non-blacks, and those aged 30-54. White middle class women, without recent victimization experience, were particularly fearful if they watched a lot of TV news.  It may be, therefore, that these women see the TV victims as being like themselves.  They become afraid because the victims portrayed in the news often seem like them.  A study of the gender and race of victims portrayed on TV news, carried out just after the present data were collected, suggested that white females were the victims most likely to be portrayed on TV news., Conclusion.  Watching TV news (or perhaps watching American TV news)  leads to an increased perception of vulnerability to crime -- particularly for those most likely to be portrayed as victims on TV news.   Interestingly enough, the measures of newspaper or magazine reading did not appear to have the same effect.  When it comes to explaining fear of crime, look to television., Reference.

"A detailed study over a ten year period of newspaper coverage of teenage “gangs” showed that coverage of teenage gangs and delinquency increased even though there was no statistical evidence for increasing rates of delinquency.  For anyone reading those newspapers carefully,  delinquency would mean gangs.",", Context.  The period from 1987 to 1996 was, for many parts of the U.S., a period when juvenile arrests went up considerably.  However, in Hawaii, the increase was modest and, when status offences were excluded, there was, in fact, a decrease in juvenile crime.  There was, then, “an absence of  an “explosion” or “epidemic” of local juvenile crime” in the state (p. 98)., This study examined newspaper coverage of juvenile delinquency and juvenile gangs during this period.  There was evidence of an explosion of coverage of these topics.  In the second five years of the period studied (1992-6) there were almost twice as many stories about gangs as there were in the first period (1987-91) and over seven times as many stories focusing on juvenile delinquency.  However, juvenile arrests (other than for status offences) were not increasing during this time and survey data (of young people) suggest that gang membership was not increasing., Not surprisingly, a state-wide survey in 1997 showed that most people (92%) thought that juvenile arrests had increased in the previous few years.  Most of these people thought that the increase was large., Newspaper coverage of delinquency. The majority of newspaper articles were quite unremarkable.  However, when the articles did have a point of view, they often used terms like “young killers” and included “advice” from “Los Angeles gang experts” that Hawaii “has all the makings for a youth gang crisis” (p. 106).  The gangs were described by the police as “well organized in a paramilitary situation.”  The media, then “set the stage for a war that had not yet occurred” (p. 107).  At the other end of the spectrum delinquents were described as “blameless victims of circumstance who can be saved by particular, high profile programs.”, The difficulty, as the authors point out, is that “absent from these media accounts are the gritty complexities of life for youth in communities affected by gangs and violence.”  Furthermore, the authors suggest that “naive assertions of the blamelessness of youth ultimately fuel public cynicism about constructive approaches to prevention and intervention efforts, while simultaneously permitting “get tough” politicians to characterize all programs as ineffective.” (p. 114)., The conclusion is simple: Crime in newspapers does not necessarily give a reasonable picture of what is happening.  Changes over time in what is in newspapers does not necessarily reflect changes in crime.  Crime and the coverage of crime are driven by different forces.

"Crime may have decreased in New York during William Bratton’s reign as chief of police. But it almost certainly did not happen because he endorsed a “zero tolerance” strategy toward minor crime and other irritants.  For one thing, murders decreased in other cities (e.g., San Diego where murders decreased 41%) that had completely different approaches to policing.  But more importantly, the idea that crime was reduced in New York through a “zero tolerance” approach simply does not fit the facts: there were far too many other things going on in New York to make it plausible that simple changes in police strategies made a difference.",", Context.   William Bratton was chief of police in New York City for a few years beginning in January 1994.  This was good timing: murder rates peaked in or around 1993 in many cities and states in the U.S. and began to decline thereafter.  The reductions were as dramatic as the increases in the late 1980s had been.  Criminologists have debated, and still are trying to explain, both the 1980s increase and the 1990s decrease in violent crime.  William Bratton must find such debates rather senseless.  He takes full credit, in this short article, for the decline in crime in New York.  As he states the case, “The murder rate has declined by over 50 per cent in New York City because we found a better way of policing” (p. 41). [The reader should understand that the “we” is a “royal we.”], Most thoughtful analysts disagree with Bratton.  One -- Charles Pollard, the Chief Constable of the Thames Valley Police notes that the rhetoric associated with New York’s “new” police style is “concentrated on aggression: on ruthlessness in dealing with low level criminality and disorderliness.... , of confrontational accountability systems.. and on the single-minded pursuit of short term results” (page 44)., These papers.  The first of these papers is a simple clear statement by Bratton himself about why he takes personal credit for the crime reduction that occurred in New York.  The second, by Chief Constable Pollard is a thoughtful -- and gentle -- critique of Bratton’s paper.   He points out, for example, that “zero tolerance” and the “broken windows” theory of crime are not the same.  The latter implies that “minor incivilities”, if unchecked and uncontrolled, produce an atmosphere in a community or on a street in which more serious crime will flourish.”  Minor problems give a sign that disorder will be ignored.   This is quite different from the “zero tolerance” notions so favoured by the right which imply “aggressive, uncompromising law enforcement.”, Pollard points out that “zero tolerance” law enforcement has the unintended effect of taking most of one’s police officers off the street and out of the communities since they will be spending all of their time processing minor criminals through the criminal justice system.   Furthermore, it could well undermine the legitimacy of the police since it implies that all problems of order are police problems and should be dealt with harshly rather than sensitively.    Finally, Pollard points out that Bratton’s own description of what went on in New York can be challenged on empirical grounds: he noted how easy it is for the data to be manipulated by police highly motivated to do so (page 52-3)., Conclusion.  In responding to William Bratton’s self-serving description of policing in New York, Chief Constable Charles Pollard of the Thames Valley (England) Police points out that the “New York miracle” has to be examined carefully and when it is, it is found to be wanting.  More important is his observation that “law enforcement on its own has only limited capacity to deal with crime, disorder and fear.”  And when the limits of aggressive policing are met, there is nowhere to go: “The police will have lost touch with the community.  Confidence will have drained away” (p. 54).  Zero tolerance policing provides just one more example of how simple solutions rarely solve complex problems., References.  Bratton, William J.  Crime is down in New York City: Blame the police.

Drug programs based on a “harm reduction” approach -- where policy is based on pragmatic rather than solely moral grounds and where the ultimate test is whether the world is a better place -- have been implemented in various countries in response to drug problems.  Switzerland has begun a heroin prescription program for 800 seriously addicted persons.  It appears to have a crime reduction effect.,", Context.  Prescribing prohibited drugs as a way of reducing the harmful side effects of criminalizing drugs is a controversial policy.  Some of the more liberal European countries have, from time to time, had such programs.  Switzerland has recently implemented such a program on the argument that it can be justified if the harmful effects of drug dependency can be reduced even though the dependency itself is not affected., The program.  Switzerland has methadone programs for about 13,000 heroin addicts.  However, within this group, there are some who return to heroin anyway.  This program targets the “worst” group -- those who have failed in other programs, have “obvious signs” of physical or psychological problems, and tend to have long drug and prison histories.   Police suspect that these categories of people are responsible for a disproportionate amount of street crime, where the goal is to get money for drugs., The goal of the program, then, is to reduce the “need” to acquire money illegally: heroin is administered in small specialized clinics and is injected on the spot., The preliminary results are very encouraging: criminal activity (violent and non-violent property crime) by this group of people appears to have been reduced considerably at least in the first six months of the program.   The participants in the program are, presumably, just as addicted as they were in the past.  Their impact on the rest of society is, however, considerably less., Conclusion.  In the area of drugs, as elsewhere, the first policy question one must ask is simple: what is the goal of the policy?  In this case, the goal was not, primarily, to save the souls (or, perhaps, even the bodies) of the severely addicted people.  It was to reduce the harm to society and, perhaps, as well, to the addicts.  Giving them heroin appears to be a successful strategy., Reference: Killias, Martin and Juan Rabasa.  Less crime in the cities through heroin prescription?

Estimates of dramatically increased crime (or cases coming to youth court)  because of an increased number of adolescents in the population are nonsense.   Careful modeling of the demographic changes show that the effect of demographic changes are trivial when compared to year-to-year changes that can occur in the rate at which young people are arrested for crimes.,", Context.  Obviously if there are more youth in a community, there will be more youth crime. The difficulty, however, is that without careful modeling of age-specific crime rates (and variation over time in these rates),  statements which picture an awkward army of adolescents appearing over the horizon are best thought of as hypotheses rather than descriptions.  One should question (but neither reject nor accept) headlines such as one that appeared in the Toronto Sun recently  (16 March 1998, page 4) -- “Ontario’s attorney general warns:  Youth crime wave looms.”, James Q. Wilson has suggested that “just beyond the horizon, there lurks a cloud that the winds will soon bring over us.  The population will start getting younger again.  By the end of this decade [the 1990s] there will be a million more people between the ages of 14 and 17.... This extra million will be half male.  Six percent of them will become high rate, repeat offenders.... Get ready” (quoted on page 6).   Wilson was obviously talking about the U.S. as a whole.  In that context,  the 30,000 “high rate repeat offenders” constitutes about 0.01% of the population which may not be enough even to notice in crime statistics.  In California in 1996, young males (age 15-24) made up about 7% of the population.  A 15% increase in their numbers will mean that they will constitute about 8% of the population (p.7)., This study looks carefully at one jurisdiction -- California.  Studies on this topic should be jurisdiction specific since the two main pieces of data -- the age distribution of the community and the age-specific crime rates -- may vary across jurisdictions.  Nevertheless, the lessons learned from one jurisdiction can be helpful for those elsewhere., The findings are quite clear: as the author states, “Demography is not destiny” (p. 1).  The estimate that one gets for crime in the future depends, not surprisingly, more on the crime rates of different cohorts of children than on the (rather small) variation in the proportion of the population that they constitute. Violence rates are highly age specific. Homicide arrest rates in California in 1981, for example were about 25 per 100,000 for the highest group (20-year-olds) and about half that for 40 year olds. In 1994, things had changed dramatically.  The peak occurred earlier (age 18) and was much higher (about 48 per 100,000 18 year olds).   But the rate for 40 year olds was much the same (or a bit lower) as it had been 13 years earlier. The problem is that different “birth cohorts” do vary in their (eventual) crime rates.  There have been times when rates have increased as much as 3% over the previous birth cohort for years at a time.  Over a long period of time, this amounts to a substantial increase.  Decreases (from one birth cohort to the next) have also occurred., Conclusion.  What lies in store for a community (or in this case, California), “depends on the upbringing of young [people in the community] - today” (p. 2).  “If, from this time on, every birth cohort is substantially more violent than the previous one, California [or any jurisdiction] is destined to experience a troubling wave of violence, commencing early in the next century.”  There is room for optimism, however, since  “One element in the equation that matters -- the future behaviour of today’s children -- is one that could be modified” (page 11)., Reference: Abrahamse, Allan.  The coming wave of violence in California.   Santa Monica, California: The Rand Corporation, 1997., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV1N4.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-1-no-4-%E2%80%93-march-1998,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 1, No. 4 – March 1998",Regular Issue,1998
"Contrary to the views expressed by the far right, public views suggest that rehabilitation should remain as an integral part of correctional policy.",", Context.  We are repeatedly told (in Canada as elsewhere) that people want a “tougher” criminal justice system and that prisoners should not be coddled.  At the same time, however, there are numerous public opinion polls that suggest that rehabilitation should be valued within a correctional setting.  Unfortunately, in Canada, we do not have much carefully conducted research on this issue, though we do know that people would rather spend money on alternatives to prison rather than prison construction (for both adults and for youth)., This study was carried out in Ohio, a state that does not have the reputation of being liberal on criminal justice matters.  People were asked “general” questions about the relative weight that should be given to rehabilitation in prison (in contrast with  “punishment” and “protecting” society).  They were also given short “vignettes” -- that varied on a large number of dimensions (gender of accused, criminal record, drug use, employment history, current offence, sentence, and type of rehabilitation program).  They were asked a number of questions about the vignette dealing, in effect, with whether they supported the use of rehabilitation with the offender., The results are simple.  People were more likely to list “rehabilitation” than other factors as what they thought should be the “main emphasis” in most prisons (41% listed “rehabilitation” first; 32% listed “protect society” as the “main emphasis” and 20% listed “punishment” as the “main emphasis”, with 7% indicating they were not sure). At the same time, when asked to indicate how important the various purposes were,  it should be noted that protection and punishment were each listed as being very important (or important) goals of imprisonment by about 95% of the respondents.  Rehabilitation was listed as being important or very important by fewer people -- about 83%.  It appears that people are, in effect, saying that one must punish and protect -- these come naturally from being in prison -- but that rehabilitation is also very important and, therefore, needs to be the “main emphasis” of prisons., The other more specific findings suggested that people valued rehabilitation more for juveniles than for adults and seemed generally supportive of rehabilitative efforts in prison and in the community.  The respondents also generally supported the expansion of rehabilitative programs., Conclusion. Those who suggest that the public is “fed up” with rehabilitation programs for offenders misrepresent the public view. As the authors suggest, although “the public desires punishment and... people want to be protected from predatory criminals, it appears... that the public still is receptive to treating offenders; the appeal of the rehabilitative ideal remains widespread” (page 253)., Reference: Applegate, Brandon K., Francis T.

"Metropolitan counties in the U.S. with higher welfare rates have lower homicide rates, even when other factors are controlled for.","Context. A politician running for governor of Florida once stated that “The accumulated evidence of the last thirty years is conclusive. Welfare does not prevent crime.  Welfare causes crime.”  He did not, apparently, produce any evidence. There are others more closely connected to criminology (e.g., James Q. Wilson) who make similar evidence-free arguments by suggesting that the welfare system “encourages denial or responsibility among the poor and reduces attachment to traditional institutions” (p. 31).   There are equally plausible arguments on the other side: more generous welfare payments may “reduce violent crime by alleviating the personal strains of poverty and poverty induced community disorganization” (p. 32). Interestingly, there are data related to this hypothesis: “higher state social welfare expenditures [are] associated with substantially lower suicide rates” (p. 35).   This study investigates the impact of welfare rates on homicide -- a crime less likely to be affected by reporting problems than other violent crimes., This study examined 437 large metropolitan U.S. counties where adequate data could be found on relevant variables.  The generosity of the welfare system was “the average amount of public assistance per poor recipient....”  Poor meant that the recipient’s income level fell below the federally established poverty line.  Most of the public assistance was in the form of general welfare payments and Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Other factors -- such as economic deprivation (percent persons in poverty, percent female headed families, family income inequality) and population structure (population density and size of community) were also controlled for. Hence any effect of welfare aid (welfare payment per poor person; percent of poor families on welfare) would be above and beyond these other factors., The results were quite simple: The usual types of factors had an impact on homicide rates:  “resource deprivation” (percent of persons living in poverty, family income inequality), population structure (density, size of the metropolitan area) and the proportion of the population between 16 and 29 years old.  But more importantly, various indexes of the generosity of the welfare system had an impact over and above these other factors: more generous welfare systems were associated with lower homicide rates.  These are non-trivial differences.  Those counties with the highest welfare rates had an average homicide rate of 5.5 per 100,000 in the population (controlling for other factors).  The rate for those with the lowest welfare rates was 9.0 per hundred thousand., Conclusion.  “Eliminating welfare for those truly in need, or forcing people to work at jobs yielding lower net income than could previously be obtained through welfare assistance, could well result in an increase in homicide rates.  Despite [the well documented] flaws [with the U.S. welfare system] welfare aid seems to reduce the frequency of lethal violence, a fact that speaks to the considerable importance of social support for enhancing social control.... The results emphasize the role of material deprivation and suggest that the state can do more than just punish homicidal violence, it can also prevent it.” (p. 42-3).  Welfare, then, doesn’t cause crime as some politicians would suggest, but reductions in welfare rates contributes to high murder rates., Reference.

The rate of serious juvenile violent crime is not increasing in Canada.  Those who argue that the “quality” of youth violence is getting more serious are doing so in the complete absence of data.  The available data demonstrate that there is no evidence of an increase.,", Context.   Most responsible observers of crime in Canada have concluded that crime rates in Canada have been more or less stable during the 1990s.   Statistics Canada’s General Social Survey showed no real change in individual victimizations (violent or not) between 1988 and 1993.   There is no evidence of any increase in homicide rates in Canada since the mid-1970s.  In fact, the overall rate of homicide in Canada is lower than it was in the mid-1970s.  The number (or rate) of youths charged with homicide varies a lot from year to year, but there is no evidence of an overall upward trend., Nevertheless, there are those who are undaunted by such data and suggest that although the numbers do not show an increase, somehow the individual acts of violence themselves have gotten worse.  For them, it seems, every silver lining has its cloud.  And apparent evidence of the cloud can be found in the annual youth court statistics:  Although the number of cases brought to youth court has gone down slightly (4.6%) between 1991 and 1996, the number of cases involving violence has gone up considerably (16.4%) during this same period (p. 188)., This study analyzes this increase in detail by testing the hypothesis that the increase in violent cases coming to court is the result of policies that require or encourage the bringing to court of minor acts of violence.  This hypothesis would suggest that judges and others who believe that they are “seeing more violence” and who believe that “more youth crime involves violence than it used to” are correct, if it is made clear that they are referring to youth violence brought to court rather than youth violence as it is occurs on the street., The findings of this study are simple.  The increase in youth violence arriving at the court door is almost exclusively due to increases at the lower end of violence -- the lowest of the three levels of assault.  The rate of common assault has, in fact, gone up dramatically (31.3% more cases in 1995-6 than in 1991-2; p. 189).  However,  the rate of all other violent crime has not changed in this same period (Tables on p. 188 & 189).  Looking, for example, at the three levels of non-sexual assault, the less serious the violence, the larger the increase.  This finding is completely consistent with the hypothesis that the increase in violent cases coming to court has to do with changes in adult behaviour (citizens’ and police officers’ decisions to deal with minor violence in the court).   If we are looking for someone to blame for the increase in youth violence arriving at the court door, then, we should blame adults, not kids., The first cousins to those who say, incorrectly,  that youth violence is getting “more serious” are those who say that violence by girls is getting worse.  The data for girls are almost exactly the same as the overall results: the increase in “girl violence” is largely due to an enormous increase in the number of common assaults coming to court.  More serious assaults do not show an increase (p. 191). Girls account for only about 20% of the cases of violence arriving at the youth court.  When girls are brought to court for a violent offence, the level of violence is lower than the violence attributed to boys. Girls are brought to court less than boys for violence, and when they are brought to court for a violent act, the charge is usually less serious., Conclusion: The increase in violent cases coming to court in Canada appears to be the result of decisions by citizens and criminal justice officials to bring more minor cases to court.  The rate of bringing serious violence cases to court has not increased.  Youths are no more violent today than they were in the early part of this decade.  Those concerned with laws governing young offenders should develop policy knowing that rates of “youth violence” are probably not changing., Reference:  Doob, A.

"Criminal justice sanctions do not deter inner-city youths, but their criminal behaviour is affected by the behaviour of their friends, their own sense of right and wrong, and their parents.",", Context:  The “theory” behind general deterrence is inherently perceptual: if people perceive that they will be apprehended and punished, they will refrain from committing offences.  It is their perceptions, rather than the “reality” that has the impact.   Criminal justice officials’ reliance on deterrence is clearly based on the notion that potential offenders will assess the likelihood of receiving a punishment and will, therefore, not commit the crime.  There has been a fair amount of work on deterrence (and perceptual components to it).   In this body of research, there is essentially no support for the view that higher (real or perceived) levels of penalties will affect the likelihood of offending. There is, however, occasional support for the proposition that higher likelihoods of (real or actual) apprehension will affect involvement in crime., This study  examines deterrence among a group of potential offenders -- inner-city teenagers who, relative to their involvement in crime, have tended to be understudied.  They were 298 13-20 year-old (mostly 15 to 17 year old)  students in a northeastern U.S. city drawn from schools in “high-risk” neighbourhoods.   Most (94%) were non-white or Hispanic.  The behaviours examined (in the “perceptual” measures) were marijuana use, under-age alcohol use, theft and assault.   Respondents were asked how likely it was that they would be caught, whether their friends engaged in these behaviours, the likely reactions of friends, the perceived likelihood that parents would find out (and the probable response of parents), whether adults they knew did these acts and,  how wrong the respondent felt each crime was.  Finally respondents were asked about their own involvement in crime., Findings.  Perceived risk of arrest was not related to the respondent’s own delinquency.  Three factors were independent predictors of delinquency: whether the respondent’s friends were seen as involved in these same criminal activities, the perceived severity of the response of parents, and how wrong the respondent saw the behaviours to be. The author suggests that the influence of peers and of parental responses were mediated by their own internalized norms of what was right or wrong.  “The threat of legal sanctions did not deter these inner-city youths, but they were influenced by the behaviour of their friends, their own sense of right and wrong, and their parents (and perhaps other adults in their lives)....  These results support the growing consensus that crime prevention concentrating on informal influences has more potential than formal law enforcement” (p. 437)., Conclusion.  The likelihood of being caught for criminal activities may be important for middle-class people (and middle class politicians who talk about deterrence) because, as sociologists point out, they have a “high stake in conformity.” This is not the case for inner-city deprived youth: for them the perceived responses of peers and family as well as internalized norms are much more important.  Legal sanctions pale into insignificance in comparison to these other social factors., Reference:  Foglia, Wanda D.  Perceptual deterrence and the mediating effect of internalized norms among inner-city teenagers.  Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency,  1997, 34, 414-442., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV1N5.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-1-no-5-%E2%80%93-july-1998,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 1, No. 5 – July 1998",Regular Issue,1998
Violent offences by homeless male street kids will not be deterred by threats of criminal sanctions.  Policies that increase these youths’ bonds to conventional society are more likely to be effective than are policies that focus on creating harsher penalties.,", Context.  Many government policies have been proposed to deal with street crime.  In recent years, the concern about street crime has focused on crime by homeless male street youths.  These “street people” (particularly young males) are, apparently seen as being personally threatening by many members of middle class society. For this reason, it would be useful to understand crime committed by this group of people., This study reports the results of interviews carried out with 125 male street youth, under age 24, who spent a considerable amount of time each week “on the street” in Edmonton, Alberta.   Respondents were asked how many times in the past year they had committed two relatively serious property crimes (“broken into a car; broken into a house”) and how often they had committed a relatively serious assault (“attacked someone with a weapon or fists/feet injuring so badly they probably needed a doctor”)., The results showed that those youth who thought that there was a reasonable likelihood that they would be caught by the police for property crime, and those who said that being caught for property crime would be a problem in their lives, were less likely to commit these crimes.  However, the most reliable predictor of property crime appeared to be whether a youth believed that his friends were involved in such a crime., For violent crime, the pattern was somewhat different.  The youths’ perceptions of how likely it was that they would be apprehended did not have an impact the likelihood that they had engaged in serious violent behaviour. Similarly,  the youths’ estimates of the impact of police apprehension was unrelated to their own level of violence.  As the authors of the paper point out, the serious violent activities that do take place on the street “are guided more by impulse and the sway of emotion than by reflection, judgement, or premeditation” (p. 48)., Conclusion. If society is interested in doing something constructive about serious crime by male street youths, it clearly must address the factors that both lead youths to be on the street and which lead these youths to “see little wrong with their criminal behaviour” (p. 50).   “Not only do street youth lack the fear of formal sanctions but they suffer from an absence of informal controls that might restrict their criminal behaviour” (p. 50).  “Harsher penalties probably will not deter those most at risk for criminal behaviour, because they are involved in a lifestyle that reduces the perceptions of risk and provides them with an environment where criminal behaviour is required and rewarded” (p. 52). Once again, when addressing a real crime problem, we find that the solutions are likely to be found outside of the criminal justice system., Reference: Baron, Stephen W. and Leslie W. Kennedy.

"Turning children into adults for the (sole) purpose of processing them as adults in criminal courts appears to be an increasingly  popular, but ineffective policy in the United States.  A careful analysis of the practice revealed it to be part of two related trends:  America becoming afraid of its children,  and the long term, but continuous decline in the view that children can be changed.",", Context.  When a young offender, Willie Bosket, killed two New York City subway passengers shortly after being released from a maximum security youth facility in 1978, the public focus was not on why the state had failed to deal effectively with a young person who had spent only 18 months out of state agency placements between age 9 and age 15.  Instead, the focus was on the fact that the law, as it was at that time, “only” allowed him to be incarcerated for five and a half years -- until his twenty-first birthday.   Just as the story of another Willie (Willie Horton) was to influence a presidential election in 1988, Willie Bosket was the unambiguous cause of the introduction, two weeks after he was sentenced, of a change in New York’s law deeming children 13 years old or more to be dealt with automatically  as adults if they were charged with murder.  And those 14 years old or older charged with a range of offences including robbery and certain forms of burglary and assault are also automatically dealt with as adult offenders.  Since that time, state legislatures in virtually every state have made it easier -- or automatic -- to try certain juveniles as adults.   New York, it seems, led the pack., Philosophically, of course, transfers -- particularly automatic ones -- are a rather peculiar phenomenon.  In effect, the automatic transfer implies that a 14 year old who manages to get charged with an “automatic transfer” offence, becomes, as a result of that charge, mature enough to be considered to be an adult for criminal justice purposes.  One wonders which criminal charges might be capable of indicating that a 14 year old is mature enough to vote in federal elections., The response.  The United States, with its 51 criminal justice jurisdictions, allows for “natural variation” in criminal justice policy even though it may not benefit from the “natural selection” or the survival of the fittest policies.  Hence there is experience with different forms of transfer.  “Judicial waiver”, the method we are most familiar with here in Canada,  though the most common in legislation (it is present in 46 of the 50 states)  is quickly becoming less important in terms of its overall impact.  “Presumptive transfers” (similar to Canada’s law for 16 and 17 year olds charged with very serious offences) are becoming more popular and, at least in some locations in the U.S. result in dramatically more hearings and dramatically more transfers.    Though most states have legislative guidelines on judicial transfers or waivers, the broad discretion given to judges to emphasize some factors to the exclusion of others raises concerns for many.   Much more common in recent years has been the “statutory exclusion”:  36 of the 50 states automatically make children into adults for criminal justice processing if they are charged with certain serious offences.  The most recent approach  -- popular particularly with prosecutors -- is the “direct file” or “prosecutorial waiver” where the prosecutor has sole (and usually unreviewable) discretion to put the case either in the juvenile court or the adult court.  Prosecutors like it for obvious reasons: it avoids the “red tape associated with these [transfer] hearings” as the Alabama Attorney General put it (p. 395)., Sweeping the juvenile justice problem under someone else’s carpet.   Transfers do not appear to be accomplishing much good.  In the first place, there appears to be “justice by geography” even within certain states -- where the county in which a person is charged determines how the case will be tried.  Second, in “direct file” cases, where the prosecutor decides the court that will hear the case, race is critical: black youths are more likely to be transferred.  Finally, the data are reasonably clear on the effects: transfers do not reduce recidivism nor does the existence of easy or automatic “transfers” deter youth crime.   One way in which crime may be reduced because of transfers comes from another study:  “the suicide rate for juveniles incarcerated in adult prisons and jails is eight times higher than for children in juvenile facilities”  (p. 405)., Conclusion.  The transfer of youths into adult courts may well make short term political sense.  A careful examination of the data, however, suggests that increased use of transfers by any mechanism -- judicial decisions, legislative mandates, or prosecutorial decisions -- makes bad policy.  Crime is not reduced and, in fact, there are reasons, given the lack of rehabilitative programs in the adult system, to expect that wholesale transfers of youth will cause an increase, rather than a decrease, in crime., Reference: Klein, Eric K.  Dennis the Menace or Billy the Kid: An analysis of the role of

"No social agency appears to be responsible for the identification and treatment of serious and/or violent young offenders.  Nevertheless, the results of a large “study group” of experts convened by the U.S. Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention concluded that the knowledge, but not necessarily the political will, exists “to reduce the likelihood of young ‘at risk’ juveniles becoming serious and/or violent juvenile offenders” (p. 28).   It is never too early to intervene, nor is it ever too late to intervene. Serious delinquency can be reduced, but only if governments make intervention a serious priority.",", Context.  Although there does seem to be an enormous amount of public support in Canada and in the U.S. for crime prevention (See the Centre of Criminology, University of Toronto report for Canadian data and studies elsewhere in this “highlights” issue for the U.S.) there is often some ambiguity about how best to conceptualize what such delinquency programs should look like., This U.S. government report coming from a blue-ribbon panel of experts from at least three countries (including Canadian Marc LeBlanc at the University of Montreal) draws on knowledge from the social sciences on how best to deal with serious and violent juvenile offenders., How should early intervention be structured?  There are a number of known risk factors that make a young person likely to engage in serious or violent offending, but these may not be evident at the young person’s first court appearance.  Hence “public health approaches” which target youths in “at risk” (disadvantaged) neighbourhoods are likely to be the most effective.  The challenge for communities (and for the various levels of government that have an interest in the reduction of crime) is to integrate services across agencies such as the youth justice system, schools, social service (and child protection) services as well as the health system.  It is probably not too much of an oversimplification to suggest that programs that lead to healthy children are likely to be effective in addressing many of the precursors to delinquency., When considering “late” intervention, the study group found that interventions aimed at those youth who already had become serious and/or violent offenders were also possible, though “interventions for serious and/or violent offenders often have to be multimodal in order to address problems, including law breaking, substance use and abuse, and academic problems.  The administration of multimodal programs requires integration of services of the juvenile justice system, mental health, schools, and child welfare agencies. Aftercare programs are essential...”   One challenge for a country like Canada will be to integrate services that are often fragmented across ministries and levels of government., Conclusion. We can be either optimistic or extremely pessimistic about the findings of this expert panel.  The reasons for optimism are clear:  much is known about what will make a healthy (and peaceful) young person.  We know that the lives of young people are shaped early.  At the same time, we know that interventions in mid- to late- adolescence can have positive effects.  The pessimism comes from the fact that knowing what should be done and actually doing something about it are different.  None of the effective approaches advocated by this blue ribbon panel appear to be the kinds of interventions that can be announced, implemented, and shown to be having a measurable effect on crime within a single political mandate.  Only a politician who is serious about making a long lasting difference, therefore, would be interested in following the advice of these experts., Reference:  Loeber, Rolf and David P.

"Community based sanctions are acceptable to members of the public when the public is asked about “real” cases and is not asked, simply, whether “sentences are harsh enough.” The sanctions, however, must have real consequences for the offender in order to be acceptable to the public.",", Context. Broad public opinion poll questions about whether people think the courts are harsh enough almost always find that people want harsh penalties. “Given these numbers, it is understandable why virtually every elected official has jumped aboard the ‘get tough’ bandwagon and is wary of supporting policies that appear to treat offenders leniently.”  These opinion questions, however, may assess “a general anger at, or a desire for protection from, the stereotypic chronic violent offender often portrayed in the media” (p. 7).  These broad questions seldom assess support for rehabilitative approaches, and seldom give any details about offenders., This study.  A survey in Cincinnati, Ohio, asked respondents to read a short vignette describing a crime and the offender.  Respondents were asked not only about their preferred sentence, but also which sentences they would tolerate.  The vignettes varied across respondents.  There were four crimes (two types each of robbery -- a purse snatching --  and burglary of a store).  In some vignettes, the offender was described as carrying a gun; in others he was not.  In some of the robberies, the victim suffered a physical injury; in some she did not.  The amount taken in the burglary varied.  Finally, the age, presence of a drug problem, prior record, and employment status of the offender varied., Findings.  Every respondent indicated that there should be some form of punishment imposed Across vignettes, prison was the preferred option for 34-56% of the cases.  Generally speaking, however,  the data support the conclusion that “the public is reluctant to tolerate community based sanctions that do not include close monitoring of offenders” (p. 17). The data suggest, then,  that community based alternatives are supported (even in a population that typically says that sentences are too lenient) even for relatively serious cases. There were, however, big differences in the preference for, and acceptability of, different community sanctions.  “Regular probation” -- where the only real consequence was that the offender had to meet with the probation officer once a month for two years -- was seldom seen as preferred or acceptable.  The authors suggest that community based sanctions need to be “developed and applied meaningfully.”, Conclusion:  In this survey (as in surveys carried out by the Centre of Criminology, University of Toronto recently in Ontario), ordinary people -- even those who say that they think that sentences are not harsh enough -- are quite supportive of the use of community sanctions.  These sanctions must have meaningful consequences.  And the public’s support for community sanctions is more evident when they are responding to actual cases., Reference:  Turner, Michael G., Francis T.

"The public supports the use of tax money to provide social programs aimed at providing help to children at risk of developing into offenders.  Data show that, at an aggregate level, children at risk can be identified. Programs exist which can reduce the incidence of delinquency in a community.  Those programs that are likely to reduce offending will provide a direct benefit to the children themselves that go far beyond delinquency.  So why is it so hard, politically, to invest in the prevention of offending by young people?",", Context.  Criminologists can sometimes be accused of being overly pessimistic about two aspects of crime prevention.  They have a tendency not to be supportive of programs that may show incremental, sometimes small, but beneficial effects on young people.  Second, they often are exceptionally concerned about increased state intervention in the lives of children and others.  Notwithstanding these views, three empirical conclusions can be supported that suggest that early intervention is to be encouraged:, Early intervention has other justifications: “Because of the link between offending and numerous other social problems, any measure that succeeds in reducing crime will have benefits that go far beyond this.  Any measure that reduces crime will probably also reduce  alcohol abuse, drunk driving, drug abuse, sexual promiscuity, family violence, truancy, school failure, unemployment, marital disharmony and divorce...”(David Farrington, quoted here on p. 189).  What is needed, however, is public support.  Does it exist?, This study reports survey results of 390 Tennessee residents.  They were generally a rather punitive lot: most identified themselves as moderate or conservative, and most favoured capital punishment., About three quarters of respondents favoured “spending tax dollars on programs that try to prevent crime by identifying youths early in life and rehabilitating them....” rather than “spending tax dollars to build more prisons so that more criminals can be locked up for longer periods of time.”  This finding is very similar to recent University of Toronto Centre of Criminology findings from an Ontario survey., When faced with specific early intervention programs, more than three quarters of respondents favoured each of the following: expanding preschool programs, giving special services to troubled kids, education programs to help parents of troubled kids deal with them effectively, school programs to identify troublesome youth and provide services, after school recreational programs, drug education programs, programs to keep delinquent kids in school, and rehabilitation programs for youths and parents of those convicted of offences., Conclusion: Even in conservative parts of the U.S., there is enormous support for early intervention programs for youth rather than the building of more prisons.  It is hard to imagine that a government in Canada or the U.S. could not achieve public support for progressive crime prevention rather than punitive approaches if it were willing to do so., Reference:  Cullen, Francis T., J.

Why should we have a separate youth justice system?  It’s not just a question of being less harsh: it’s a better way of reducing the social cost of youth crime.,"Separate youth justice systems make sense for a number of quite distinct reasons including the following:, The trend at the moment is to a shift toward an adult system for dealing with young offenders.  This may occur in terms of the actual legislation dealing with young offenders (e.g., by making it more punitive in its orientation) , or, as in the United States, by shifting more and more young people into the adult justice system. This would appear to be counterproductive., Conclusion. “The most effective means to implement the lessons from developmental psychology is to maintain a system of adjudication and disposition that is separate from the adult criminal justice system” (p. 188).  “Commitment to the development of intensive rehabilitative interventions for young offenders and to the protection of the future prospects of youths whose crimes are adolescent-limited offers the long term promise of lowering the social cost of youth crime more effectively than the blanket punitive policies that are now in vogue” (p. 188-9)., Reference: Scott, Elizabeth S. and Thomas Grisso.

"Crime prevention programs should be shown not only to be effective, but “cost effective” in terms of the reduction of costs -- criminal justice and social.  Such programs do exist for youth.  Investment in them will not only reduce crime, but will save money.",", Background.  Finding programs to treat delinquent youths is not difficult.  Finding programs that are effective is somewhat more difficult.  And finding the “best” way to invest money in reducing crime is even more difficult.  This study, carried out by the Washington State Institute for Public Policy, examined programs for youth where there was sound research to examine their costs and outcomes., Results.  Programs do exist, but their impact on youth is often “modest.”  They certainly will not guarantee success.  “The best interventions for juvenile offenders lower the chance of re-offending by about 40%” (p. 7).  Typically, the programs reduce rates of recidivism by about 20-30%. This is important to keep in mind, because it means that the graduates from the best known programs will often re-offend.  It is also relevant when one hears claims in the media about “quick fix” interventions.  But these modest impacts -- e.g., a reduction of reconviction rates from 45% to 27% (a 40% reduction) for probationers in some locations -- may still be worthwhile., The question, from a public policy perspective is simple: If a program is likely to reduce recidivism by only modest amounts (20-30%), is it still worth it?  The answer is “yes” -- sometimes.   First of all, one has to ask whether one is interested only in public costs -- typically “criminal justice system” costs.  Some programs do not show a savings on criminal justice costs alone, but do show savings if the costs to victims of crimes are included. Also, for some programs (e.g., early intervention programs directed at health or education issues), other benefits of the program to society can be measured., But for many of the sixteen programs that are examined in this paper, there are criminal justice savings that can be shown within a year or two.  For example, in a “program for first time minor offenders on diversion where youth appear before a community accountability board shortly after committing an offence”  (the Thurston County FastTrack Diversion program), there is a 29% reduction in offending, with a savings to the criminal justice system of about $2700 per participant after one year.  In large part, this savings may come from the fact that its taxpayers costs are low ($136 per participant).  Other intensive programs funded solely with public money take longer to show criminal justice savings., But there are some expensive, and thoroughly evaluated,  programs that will never show any kind of benefit when one looks at a measure like “felony reconvictions by age 25.” Juvenile boot camps are one notable example., Conclusion: Cost effective programs exist for reducing recidivism of juvenile offenders and to prevent delinquency.   They are not necessarily cheap to implement but when considered as investments, they are sensible. Some of the intensive supervision programs, for example,  cost $4500-$6000 per participant and take a few years to show criminal justice savings.  A program for chronic juvenile offenders including a home placement with trained foster parents and other treatment and probation services was quite expensive, but showed benefits to victims and for criminal justice budgets.  Evaluated solely in terms of changes in recidivism rates, however, these programs might be seen as having only modest benefits.  However, as investments to achieve victim and criminal justice savings, they were very effective., Reference: Aos, Steve, Robert Barnoski, and Roxanne Lieb.  Preventive programs for young offenders: Effective and Cost effective.  Overcrowded Times, 1998 (April), 9 (2), 1,7-11., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV1N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-1-no-6-%E2%80%93-september-1998,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 1, No. 6 – September 1998",Regular Issue,1998
Crime can be reduced by the collective action of those who  live or work in local city blocks that have drug and  disorder problems.  The police can help by supporting groups on the block and by coordinating services that address non-crime problems on the block.,", What can be done to reduce crime in an urban area?  Those living in a neighbourhood have little direct control over who lives in their neighbourhood.  Similarly,  it is difficult for people to create “cohesive” or “caring” neighbours.  But people can do some things to reduce crime in their neighbourhoods.  Police statistics are sometimes used to identify “hot spots” -- where crime and disorder are likely to occur.  Typically, these “hot spots” are single city blocks which acquire characteristics that are conducive to crime.  And city blocks, even more than “neighbourhoods,”  turn out to be sensible sociological, as well as geographic, units to examine when attempting to prevent crime.  For a crime to take place, one needs an offender (without controls) a victim (without protection) and an appropriate location., This study identified city blocks in Oakland, California, that clearly had crime and disorder problems. On-site observations were made, and resident “place managers” were interviewed. “Place managers” are people who “live or work near problem places and who, by virtue of their proximity and interests, may have primary or personal responsibility to the street block” (p. 383). Typically four place managers per block were interviewed., Implementing crime prevention strategies.  City blocks were randomly assigned to receive special attention from a unit of the Oakland police.  This unit worked with individual citizens, coordinated visits by other local government agencies (fire, public works, rodent control officers, utility companies, etc.) to ensure that all building, safety, etc., codes were enforced, as well as to ensure that owners of problematic properties were made aware of the problems (e.g., the selling of drugs).   The “control” blocks got standard police patrols., The results demonstrated two independent types of effects. First, “collective action” on the part of place managers -- meeting with community groups about problems, working with the police or community groups about problem areas, participating in a neighbourhood cleanup, participating in neighbourhood or block watch programs, etc., -- had positive effects.   Signs of disorder were reduced. The number of people observed selling drugs was reduced on the blocks where there was more collective action taken by place managers.  Second, above and beyond these effects, those areas targeted (on a random basis) for the police department’s “special attention” in coordinating other city services, showed positive change on these same measures.   Individual action by place managers (e.g., simply calling 911 or the drug hotline, talking to building managers or tenants) did not have a positive impact., Conclusion: Collective action by place managers seemed to be effective in reducing crime and disorder as was support from the police in dealing with aspects of the block that made it an inviting site for problems.  As the authors point out “place managers play an important role in controlling drug and disorder problems... and may be most effective when they are more socially integrated with their neighbours on the street block and when they are involved in collective, rather than individual, problem solving efforts” (p. 397). Individual actions, such as simply calling the police, did not seem to be effective. “Police efforts that build working relationships with a core group of place managers may have a greater likelihood of long term success than police building one-on-one working relationships with individual place managers.”  Collective neighbourhood actions appear to be important., Reference: Mazerolle, Lorraine Green, Colleen Kadleck, and Jan Roehl.  Controlling drug and disorder problems:  The role of place managers.  Criminology, 1998, 36 (2), 371-403., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV1N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-1-no-6-%E2%80%93-september-1998,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 1, No. 6 – September 1998",Regular Issue,1998
Alleviating the poverty of those in society who are most in need helps everyone: property crime levels go down.,", Background.  The view that “poverty causes crime” is challenged, sometimes, by those who argue that welfare undermines families and economic values and is, itself, a cause in crime.  There has been, recently, a good deal of work on this subject. A paper summarized in Highlights reported that locations that had low welfare rates had high homicide rates.  The underlying assumption behind these findings was that more generous support payments reduced stress on people which resulted in lower levels of interpersonal violence., This paper looked at 437 metropolitan counties in the U.S. with populations over 100,000 where reasonable estimates of property crime rates (burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft)  could be obtained.  The main measure of poverty was the amount received per person from the national program “Aid for families with dependent children” which, though national in scope, has rates set by the state.  These measures were then corrected for cost of living by using a measure of the average rent paid by the poor.  A list of other factors were controlled for to see whether welfare rates had an impact above and beyond these well known correlates of crime.  These “control” factors included the following: The percentage of families that were poor and headed by a female, the percentage of women who were divorced, unemployment rates, average income, and the percentage of the population age 16-24 (the highest property-crime prone age)., Findings.  The standard predictors of crime generally did predict each of the crimes that were examined (burglary, larceny, and auto theft).  But above and beyond each of these, the two welfare measures -- the percent of poor families who actually receive welfare, and the welfare payment per person adjusted for cost of living -- had a significant impact on each of the crimes: higher welfare rates, or a higher proportion of people actually able to receive welfare led to lower crime rates., Since it is sometimes suggested that high welfare rates “serve as a disincentive for creating and maintaining married couple families among the poor,” the authors of this study also examined the predictors of divorce rates and proportion of families in the county that were poor and headed by a female.  As it turns out, high welfare rates were associated with lower divorce rates and lower rates of poor female headed families., Conclusion. Those who argue that high welfare rates undermine traditional values and thus encourage crime are simply wrong.  High welfare rates (amount given in welfare benefits or rules which allow access to welfare) lead to low crime rates.  These findings are not rhetoric: the study used data from hundreds of metropolitan counties in the U.S., Reference: Hannon, Lance and James DeFronzo.  Welfare and property crime.  Justice Quarterly, 1998,  15 (2), 273-287., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV1N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-1-no-6-%E2%80%93-september-1998,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 1, No. 6 – September 1998",Regular Issue,1998
Communities are often convinced that there is an unprecedented “gang” problem.  The result is that resources are mobilized even though the problem may be more in our heads than on our streets.  But the effects of these kinds of panics are real and long lasting.,", Context.  A recent survey of prosecutors in the U.S. found that most saw “gangs” as a growing problem in their communities.   The problem is that the evidence supporting the view that gang crime (and gang violence in particular) is growing is suspect. Some social scientists have pointed out that seeing “gangs” (or crime generally) as an increasing problem serves the needs of criminal justice groups  -- particularly in times when there is competition for legitimacy and resources.  This paper looks at a sudden increase in concern about gangs in Las Vegas, Nevada in the late 1980s and early 1990s., History of gangs in Las Vegas.  Before the mid-1980s there appeared to be no gang problem. Nevertheless, in 1985 two police officers were assigned to gather evidence on gangs.  These officers announced in 1986 that there were 4000 gang members in the city involved in crime.   Media coverage of gangs skyrocketed from fewer than 25 stories about gangs per year from 1983-7 to approximately 140-170 per year in 1988-91.  A poll in 1989 showed that most residents (89%) thought that gang problems were worsening.  Police sweeps were authorized and, patrols (often by undercover police) of schools began.  New statutes were introduced; consideration was given to banning gang membership, and penalties for “gang-benefiting” crimes were increased.  By 1992, the police began to declare a victory over the gangs and, as laws were passed that gave police additional powers and large increases in police budgets were approved, the gang “problem” disappeared from public view., What happened.  Police data suggested that during this period police recorded charges against those identified by the police as being gang members increased from about 3% to 7% of those charged, but most of the increase occurred late in the period -- around 1992 or so. However, even prosecutors were not comfortable with the labeling of gang members, suggesting that the statistics of gang membership might be vastly exaggerated.  When the concern erupted, “known gang members accounted for only about 3% of all reported violent crime” in the county.   The anti-gang legislation was, with a couple of exceptions, almost never used against gang members., Conclusion:  A moral panic suggesting that “gangs” were a serious and growing problem in Las Vegas in the late 1980s was created where there was no real evidence of any change in the prevalence of gang problems.  But such events do not occur spontaneously.  When do panics occur?  The group that benefited most from the view that “gangs were out of control” -- the police -- appeared to have created the moral panic. Stories of gangs came, not surprisingly, at a time when there was a budget crunch and when the legitimacy and fairness of the police were being questioned (because of allegations of brutality). Police spoke of the growing threat from gangs, the “fact” that the police were “out-gunned” by the gang members, and needed new resources and new legislation. The police presented a “four year plan” for increased resources to combat gangs. In the end, the panic disappeared: newspaper articles about gangs dropped off dramatically by 1994.  But the police got their resources and their laws, and attention was diverted from ongoing police scandals.   But throughout the whole panic period, even using the police department’s own statistics, gang activity, if it increased at all, never accounted for more than 5-7% of crimes.  Gangs, even though they were largely imaginary, had an impact, but on the criminal justice system, not on crime., Reference: McCorkle, Richard C. and Terance D.

"The ultimate result of punishing the disadvantaged -- “deviance” becomes normal. A study of African American men ages 18-35 shows that half were under some form of criminal justice control on any given day in 1997.  Sometime during their lives, 80% of African American men will spend at least one night in prison.",", Background:  Recent studies in U.S. cities have found that a high portion of black males are likely to be subject to some form of criminal justice control.  Some attribute this to high levels of crime; some to enforcement strategies. There is no doubt that different types of activities are likely to be differentially enforced.  For example, the street selling or possession of certain drugs in some cities is the subject of large scale enforcement activities, whereas the selling and use in private dwellings is not seen as worthy of notice.  Similarly, under U.S. federal sentencing guidelines, possession of crack cocaine results in a dramatically harsher criminal justice response than does possession of one of its main ingredients (cocaine in powder form).  88% of those subject to the harsher penalties for crack are black (and most of those subject to penalties for cocaine in its natural state are white). Such policies obviously explain some of the problem., This study had a very simple purpose: to do a “census” of black men in the criminal justice system as a first step toward understanding the impact of the system on this group of people.   The focus was Washington, D.C.  When looking at the criminal justice figures, it is important to remember that Washington D.C’s population is about two-thirds (65%) black., Almost everyone who is being held in the D.C. Department of Corrections is black.  Corrections had 8153 blacks and 135 whites.  Within the D. C. Department of Corrections, “The fraction of African American men in treatment facilities ranges between 64% and 77%... depending on the facility, but in custodial facilities, the range is between 94% and 99%...” (p. 359).  Figures for other parts of the criminal justice system are similar.  In total, “On an average day in early 1997, 50% of the African American men between the ages of 18 and 35 were under justice control... This number is troubling both for its size and its irrelevance to public safety” (p. 365)., The result of criminalizing a substantial portion of a large population is, of course, that funds are not available for much else.  In 1996, Washington, D.C. spent $842 million on criminal justice (17% of its budget). Less than that ($795 million) was spent on public education. “During the 1980s, corrections spending increased at a rate almost 7 times that of higher education spending” (p. 362)., What can be done?  There are many ways in which the situation in Washington could be addressed.  The lessons are important for any jurisdiction worried either about the over-use of the criminal justice system or about over-incarcerating specific populations., Conclusion:  A criminal justice system that has half of a vulnerable population under its control in a city with high levels of crime and very high levels of fear can be described as a system that is not accomplishing its goals.  Washington serves as the example of what happens when a single simplistic approach (criminal justice sanctioning) to a complex problem (crime) is allowed to get out of control.  And it serves as a lesson to those who argue that what we need is “more” criminal justice.  Clearly “more” does not work., Reference:  Lotke, Eric.  Hobbling a generation: Young African American men in Washington, D.C.’s criminal justice system -- Five years Later.  Crime and Delinquency, 1998, 44 (3), 355-366., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV1N6.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-1-no-6-%E2%80%93-september-1998,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 1, No. 6 – September 1998",Regular Issue,1998
Mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes are shown to be less effective than treatment in reducing the use of cocaine.,", Background. Legislatures love mandatory minimum sentences.  The suggestion is that with a flick of a pen, the change in the law will reduce the level of the problem.  Mandatory minimum sentences are popular for certain kinds of crimes -- in particular those that frighten the public.  Gun crimes constitute one example, drugs another. Of course, there is almost no limit on how high the mandatory minimum might be.  If “a few years” is said to reduce the level of the problem somewhat, then “more years” should reduce it more., But there is another problem.  Many criminal justice programs, if implemented with huge amounts of resources, would be shown to be effective.  Putting a few more police on the street may not affect street crime, but putting 100 police officers into a small area probably would affect crime in that area.  Incapacitating people provides another example: locking up a few more people will not have a measurable impact on crime, but if a substantial portion of the population is in prison, there are, quite simply, fewer people on the street available to commit crime., The argument that “if one life is saved” the crime control strategy is “worth it” is a dangerous and short-sighted approach.  In an era of limited public funds for crime prevention or control, the question is not whether “one life might be saved” but whether “more lives might be saved” using a different approach.  A more socially useful approach is to ask “how many lives are saved (or whatever benefit one wants to examine) per million dollars spent” on each of a number of different programs., This study, carried out and published by the Rand Corporation, examined the impact of mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes in comparison to treatment.  The “outcome measure” that was used was “kilograms of consumption prevented per million dollars spent” on each of a number of different approaches to reducing cocaine use.  Note, however, that this is not a “value free” outcome measure: if one’s interest was largely the punishing of cocaine dealers, reduction of cocaine use would be less important.  The second point that one must consider is that some programs -- like effective treatment programs -- are more likely to show their effects in the long term., Results.   Comparing various criminal justice approaches with the “treatment of heavy cocaine users” leads to findings easy to summarize:  Treatment of heavy users results in higher levels of “kilograms of cocaine consumption prevented per million dollars spent” (103.6 kg/$1 million over a 15 year period) than does longer sentencing (12.6 kg/$1 million) , or conventional enforcement of the drug laws (27.5 kg/$1 million).   Varying the assumptions behind these models does not appear to make much difference: treatment appears to be the most effective approach, using this definition of “effective.”    It should be pointed out that if long sentences could be directed solely or largely on very high level suppliers of cocaine, and there was little or no replacement for this activity in the market, there would, obviously, be a point at which longer sentences would be cost effective. However, “it is not plausible that these [approaches and results] could pertain to the average federal mandatory minimum defendant, but there may be individuals who do meet the criteria” (p.62)., Conclusion.  “Spending additional money on arrest, prosecution, and conventional sentencing is more cost-effective than spending additional money to extend terms served [for those who are already arrested]...

Arresting domestic violence offenders does not seem to be a good strategy to get them to stop offending.  Neither does prosecuting those who are arrested.,", Background.  For about 20 years, the criminal justice systems of many jurisdictions have been examining their policies on what to do about domestic violence.  In the mid-1980s, there was some weak evidence that “arrest” was a good policy.  Careful replication of these early findings took place and the cautiously stated conclusion was that “the clear superiority of arrest in the [early] work was not replicated... [and in those studies that did have an impact] any deterrent effects of arrest were short-lived and in some cases reversed with the passage of time” (p. 435)., Arrest is not, however, everything.  Does it matter if there is a follow through by the criminal justice system and the person accused of domestic assault is prosecuted?   The evidence from earlier studies suggested that prosecution, like arrest, is no silver bullet. Various prosecutorial policies do not appear to affect the likelihood that an offender will repeat his offence., This study examined the outcome of the court hearing on recidivism in 669 domestic violence cases. The outcome measure was fairly simple:  was the defendant arrested again within six months of the handing down of the final court decision.  There were three sets of predictors: was the case dismissed in court, was probation imposed, did the accused receive a jail sentence.  Various factors were “controlled for” including the nature of the original charge, criminal record of the defendant, the relationship of defendant to victim, and whether the victim was injured., The results are simple to describe.  The offender’s criminal record predicted subsequent offending, but whether the case was dismissed, the offender put on probation or placed in jail had no impact on recidivism.   There is “no basis to conclude that recidivism was deterred by any of the [court outcomes]” (p. 440-441).    These results are “consistent with others in the field, none of which has demonstrated a deterrent effect of prosecution” (p. 441)., Conclusion.  The authors suggest that there are good reasons to suspect that the criminal justice system may be ineffective in deterring domestic violence.  Previous work has shown that arrest does not appear to deter and this study, along with others, shows that different court outcomes do not have any differential impact on the likelihood that an offender will re-offend.  Such behaviour may, simply, not be under criminal justice control. “We should not be surprised if criminal justice intervention is not the controlling factor in interpersonal relationships governed by complex forces” (p. 442).   Arrest and prosecution, then, cannot be justified in terms of their effects on recidivism.  Policies that endorse such approaches need to be examined if they are based on the idea that such criminal justice approaches will protect victims., Reference:  Davis, Robert C., Barbara E.

"Communities which teach their members that they have social and moral obligations to others -- in this study, communities in which a higher portion of total income is given to the United Way -- have less property and violent crime.","Background.  Most theories of crime examine either individual motivation, or the social and physical structures in which people live.  This paper suggests another way of thinking about communities and the people who live in them: “social altruism,” or the “willingness of communities to commit scarce resources to the aid and comfort of their members, distinct from the beneficence of the state” (p. 204).   It is suggested that “communities that can more effectively instill values that result in their members findings satisfaction in more altruistic pursuits (e.g., parenting, serving the community) are likely to be less anomic and thereby suffer lower rates of crime” (p. 207)., This paper.   The basic idea, then, was to find an indicator of social altruism and see whether communities that were high in this characteristic had lower crime rates.  The study looked at 354 U.S. cities where there was at least a million dollars collected in contributions to United Way campaigns and where crime statistics were available.  United Way was used as an indicator because of its local nature, and because there are United Way campaigns in most cities.  The measure of “social altruism” was the ratio of the amount given to the United Way over the aggregate income in the city (i.e., dollars given to United Way per million dollars of total income in the city).  Ten variables were “controlled for” statistically -- factors known to relate to relate to donations and/or crime., The results are fairly straightforward -- those communities with relatively high ratios of United Way contributions to aggregate city income have less (reported) property and violent crime.  The theory, of course, is not that the contributions reduce crime.  Rather the theory is that factors that lead people to be generous to those in their communities also tend to produce people who are less likely to commit crimes., The difficulty, of course, is that it is hard to “encourage” people directly to be altruistic.  As the authors of this paper put it, “From a rational choice perspective, altruistic behaviour, insofar as it entails a net economic loss, is likely to be rejected as counterproductive” (p. 221).  The challenge is to figure out how to encourage altruistic values in a society “regardless of the countervailing pressures that seem to be endemic to Western societies.”, Conclusion.  This paper presents data supporting an important hypothesis: that there is a characteristic of  communities -- social altruism -- that has an impact on crime rates.  Criminologists have typically looked at communities in terms of such factors as residential mobility, proportion of young people, proportion of single person households, poverty measures, etc.,  to “explain” variation in crime rates across communities.  This paper suggests an additional approach: communities that have managed to instill in people the importance of contributing to their communities are likely to have lower crime rates., Reference:   Chamlin, Mitchell B. and John K.

Treating accused people fairly can reduce the likelihood that these same people will re-offend in a similar way.  Men arrested for assaulting their wives were less likely to assault them again if they had been treated fairly by the police.,", Background.  In the early 1980s a study was done in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the results of which have been interpreted as supporting the notion that arresting those men who have apparently assaulted their spouses will make them less likely to repeat this crime.  There have been six attempts to replicate this finding (in six other American cities) and the results are, at best, equivocal showing different patterns of results in different cities.  As this paper (which includes, as one of its authors, the first author of the original Minneapolis study)  points out “other than questioning the wisdom of a mandatory arrest strategy for spouse assault, policy makers are currently provided little or no guidance from this line of research as to how they should respond to such cases” (p. 164-5)., Relevant findings.  There is some evidence that procedural fairness is important in determining people’s attitudes toward authority.  There is also a little evidence that procedural fairness affects behaviour.  Researchers in a previous study “found that litigants in small claims court were more likely to comply with even unfavourable judgments if they believed the process to be fair” (p. 171)., This paper.  The original study was not designed to look at procedural fairness. However, measures of perceived fairness of treatment were available.   The measures -- available only on those arrested for wife assault -- consisted of such things as whether the person arrested answered “yes” to the question, “Did the officers take the time to listen to your side of the story?” (p. 177).  Another item was whether the accused reported the use of physical force (p. 178).   The interest, of course, was whether those who reported being treated “fairly” were less likely to commit subsequent wife assaults., Findings.  “Repeat spouse assault [was] higher for those arrestees who perceived that they had not been treated fairly” (p. 190), and the effect of procedural fairness seemed to be equally evident for those who received short or long periods of detention., Conclusion.  This study suggests that a sensible “crime control” strategy would include concerns about procedural fairness.  There is a tendency of certain police spokespeople to focus solely on results (e.g., success in arresting someone, or success in convicting someone).  This paper suggests that it may be just as important -- or even more important -- to address the question of how people are treated.

"Inmates in a medium security prison, when asked what the appropriate sentence would be for a number of different crimes, gave sentences which, on average, are not different from what they thought the courts would give.  However, inmates see members of the general public as being more punitive than themselves (or the courts). More interestingly, most inmates think that other inmates “would reject a coherent system of legal sanctions” even though they, themselves, do not.",", Background.   For some time we have believed that inmates reject general societal values  -- particularly as they relate to crime and deviance.  The traditional notion, held by some, is that inmates “support one another in rejecting society’s norms regulating crime and punishment...  They are said to reject their rejectors.  In doing so, they are said to adhere to an unconventional or alternative set of norms” (p. 482).  This paper challenges this view., This study.  A random sample of inmates in a Massachusetts medium security correctional facility were interviewed.  They were given a series of vignettes about crime, giving information about the current crime, the offender’s race and criminal history, and the apparent motive for the crime.  Each inmate was asked: “If you personally were allowed to decide what should happen with this man, and could decide anything you wanted, what would you decide?”  In other words, prison or punishment was not required by the question.  They were then asked to estimate “In court today what would his sentence be?”  “What would the general public like to see happen to this man?” and “What would most of the inmates here like to see happen with this man?” (p. 489). Each inmate “rated” 25 vignettes., Findings.  Most (89%) of the sanctions seen as “ideal” by inmates were punitive.  They saw the courts as almost invariably (99%) giving punitive sanctions. Inmates thought that members of the public would give punitive sanctions in most (95%) of the cases.  The interesting finding, however, was that inmates thought that other inmates would give punitive sanctions in only 49% of the cases.   Generally speaking, inmates thought the offender should be incarcerated (84% of the cases), thought that the courts would incarcerate almost everyone, and also thought that the general public would incarcerate most (86%) of the offenders.  Again, of course, inmates thought that other inmates would be soft on offenders -- indicating that they thought that other inmates would incarcerate in only 39% of the cases.   Inmates themselves were responsive to crime seriousness and criminal record, and indicated that they thought that the courts and the general public would also respond to these factors.  They thought that other inmates would not sanction according to crime seriousness and thought that other inmates would give only slight weight to criminal history., Conclusion.  It is clear that inmates, as a group,  are likely to have ideas about punishment which are not too different from what (it is likely) members of the public and the courts want.  Certainly their view that punishment should be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence and the criminal record of the offender is consistent with what the courts do and with what the public wants.  The paradox, however, is that “There appears to be a myth of inmate lawlessness to which even inmates subscribe.  The individual inmate, in general, adopts the larger society’s stereotype of the typical inmate as relatively lawless, while empirical analysis indicates that as an aggregate of individuals, they reject this notion of themselves.” (p. 505).

"Instructions to juries on “reasonable doubt” can be improved.  Data from an experiment suggest that many people do not understand reasonable doubt in the manner that the law suggests.   Furthermore, the study suggests that many formulations of what “reasonable doubt” is do not significantly increase jurors understanding of the basic concept.",", Background.  Psychologists, particularly in the United States, have done a fair amount of work on how to instruct juries on the law.  The underlying theory is that the instructions can, in fact, make a difference on how well the jury applies the law since “legal language” is often so “exact” in its formulation that normal human beings cannot understand it.  Obviously a major concern has been the formulation of  “reasonable doubt” since instructions on this issue are contained in all trials and “proof  beyond reasonable doubt” is an important pillar of our criminal trial., This study.  Various formulations (five in all) of reasonable doubt were tested against one another using jury-eligible Americans.  In addition to an “undefined” version where people were told that to convict they had to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, but were not told what that meant, there were four other definitions offered to people who listened to a hypothetical case., Findings.  One of these formulations -- “... proof that leaves you firmly convinced of the defendant’s guilt...” -- came from the model instructions of the (U.S.) Federal Judicial Centre (see page 660).  This one produced “a higher self-reported standard of reasonable doubt...” (p. 664)., The participants in the study were grouped and were asked to come to a verdict.  A content analysis of their deliberations found that those who received the Federal Judicial Centre “firmly convinced” instructions spent a greater part of their deliberation time discussing the actual evidence that was presented to them as well as the “reasonable doubt” instructions  (p. 665 and Table IV, p. 666)., Conclusion. Clearly “instructions” can make a difference on what the jury understands and does. In this study, instructions that told jurors that “reasonable doubt” meant that they should be “firmly convinced” appeared to most effective. The authors suspect that the jurors found an instruction that they should be “firmly convinced” to be “accessible and understandable.” One would hope that jurors, generally, find instructions given to them to be “accessible and understandable.”  However, data such as these suggest that some quite standard instructions that are used in jury trials may not be having the desired effect., Reference:  Horowitz, Irwin A. and Laird C.

A study comparing rape and assault trials found that questions attacking the character of the victim were equally likely to occur in the two types of trials.,", Background.  The literature on rape trials would lead one to believe that victims in sexual assaults are uniquely susceptible to having their character attacked by defence counsel.  Unfortunately, these studies may present data on rape or sexual assault, but the treatment of the victim or complainant in these trials is rarely compared to the treatment of victims in other trials involving violence.  For example, one observer, quoted in this paper suggests, without systematic evidence,  that “the defence at rape trials uses a number of strands of attack to undermine the woman’s evidence and to shake her story, all of which would be considered totally unacceptable if she had reported, say, a serious non-sexual assault” (quoted on page 244).  Without systematic data, we have no idea whether such statements are true., This study.  This paper compares transcripts of  40 rape trials and 44 assault trials from Melbourne County Court (Australia).  Obviously, the trials differed on a number of characteristics. Only 15% of the assault victims, but all of the rape victims, were female. Fewer (6% vs. 48%) of the rape victims were strangers to the accused. Most of the rapes (54%) but few of the assaults (26%) had occurred in a private home. The main lines of defence used in the assault trials were self-defence (in 54% of the trials) and the assertion that the physical act did not occur (raised in 26% of the trials).  These were different from those used in the rape trials where in 79% of the trials the defendant argued that consent was given or was believed to have been given.  In terms of outcome, the prosecutions were less successful in the assault cases where 43% of the defendants were acquitted of all charges compared to 28% in the rape trials., The law in Victoria, Australia, restricts the admission of sexual history evidence in sexual assault trials (p. 250-251).  Nevertheless, over 35% of the complainants in the rape cases were subject to some cross examinations about their sexual history with the defendant or others -- mostly where the complainant was, or was said to be, a prostitute (see p. 251)., The most important finding, however, was that “issues relating to the complainant’s character and credit were just as likely to be raised in the assault trials as in the rape trials.  Similar proportions of rape and assault complainants were asked about their general drinking and drug taking habits and whether they had a history of mental or emotional instability.” Questions about criminal history of the complainant were more common in assault trials.  Over half of the complainants in both rape and assault cases were asked about possible motives for making a false report (p. 253)., Conclusion: There is more public discussion about the propriety of the defence raising questions about the character of the complainant in sexual assault trials than there is about similar cross examination  in other cases involving violence.   This study suggests that a comparative perspective is important: the problem of the complainant’s character being raised in court appears not to relate to the sexual nature of the assault.   If there is a problem, perhaps we should see it as a problem of assaults, generally., Reference: Brereton, David.

"When offenders who also are parents are incarcerated, there are predictable harms which will occur to their children.",", Background.  There are theoretical, and direct empirical, reasons to expect that the children of incarcerated parents will suffer.  For various reasons, it turns out that most incarcerated women (perhaps about 75% in the U.S.) are mothers. In the U.S., a large scale survey of prisoners estimated that 56% of men in state prisons have young children.  Hence, children with parents in prison is a non-trivial problem -- probably in Canada as well., This paper.  When one looks at each stage of development, it appears that there is evidence both from developmental psychology and from studies of the children of incarcerated parents that shows that there are profound negative effects on the children.  These effects may be general -- in terms of interfering with the healthy development of the child -- or they may be specific (e.g., leading to future criminality of the child).  In terms of the impact on the child’s future criminality, the effects may be indirect (e.g.,  creating poor self-concept which may then predispose the child toward anti-social behaviour) or may be direct.   What seems quite clear, however, is that at each stage of development (from infancy through late adolescence) the child of incarcerated parents is disadvantaged in important ways., Conclusion.  Canada’s imprisonment rate, overall, is quite high compared to most civilized countries.  Those who advocate the use of prison as a crime control strategy usually focus on the immediate effects (denunciation and incapacitation), or presumed but unsupported effects (individual and general deterrence), but seldom focus on the data that suggest that incarceration of parents can have a serious negative impact on their children. The criminal justice system focuses largely on the offender when a decision to incarcerate is made. Some attention might be given to the impact on society as a whole of such decisions since, in the end,  society as a whole pays a part of the cost borne largely by the children of incarcerated parents., Reference:  Johnson, Denise.  Effects of parental incarceration.

"Fear of crime, among whites, but not blacks, in a U.S. city, is related to the perception that there is a high proportion of black people in the neighbourhood. It is not related to the actual proportion of blacks.",", Background.  The problem in many communities is that the mere presence of certain groups -- racial groups, ethnic groups, young males, etc. -- is seen as being associated with crime.  As many observers have noted, the American “war on crime” and, in particular, the “war on drugs” has become “rhetorical code for locking up more and more black men” (p. 108)., This study.  At the height of a “media driven panic about violent crime” in Tallahassee, Florida, in 1994, a survey of 1850 adults was carried out. Fear was measured by asking people how much fear they had of being robbed by someone who has a gun or knife, being attacked physically, or having their house broken into. They were also asked to estimate the proportion in the area “within a mile of their house” who were black, white, and Latino.  They also obtained measures of  the “actual” racial composition of the respondent’s neighbourhood., The findings are simple: “The objective measure of racial composition... is unrelated to fear.  However, perceived racial composition... is significantly related to fear among whites but not among blacks” (p. 114).   Fear also is higher among those “who perceive crime to be a national problem or to be increasing in the county or their neighbourhood.”, Conclusion. It might be seen, at first blush, that this study is of little relevance to Canada since the social situations in our cities are probably quite different from the setting of this research -- Tallahassee, Florida.  However, there are probably two reasons why the results are important.  First, they remind us that it is perceptions that are important in understanding fear.  “Objective facts” are relevant only if they influence perceptions.  Second, the findings remind us that factors that affect fear are different for different parts of the population.  To the extent that fear does lower the quality of life for people experiencing it, different approaches may be important to address the fear.  From the perspective of a policy maker, it is important to remember that Canadian data demonstrate that those who are most fearful are most likely to believe that sentences are too lenient and that the courts and police are doing a bad job.  But, more generally, the study is an object lesson for anyone who thinks that changing the “reality”  -- whether it be the presence of those seen to be likely to be offenders, or changes in the law -- will affect fear of crime., Reference:  Chiricos, Ted, Michael Hogan, and Marc Gertz.  Racial composition of neighbourhood and fear of crime.  Criminology, 1997, 35 (1), 107-129., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV1N1.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-1-no-1-%E2%80%93-september-1997,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 1, No. 1 – September 1997",Regular Issue,1997
Applying what we know about supervising offenders in the community effectively can reduce criminality among those on parole or otherwise serving their sentences in the community.,", Background.  There is a fair amount of work going on these days on such things as the effectiveness of “intensive supervision” on parole or probation.  It seems likely that there is some overall impact of different kinds of correctional programs in the community.  The difficulty is that often the programs that are evaluated are rather expensive and are not likely to be implemented widely.  Similarly, there tends to be more focus on whether certain “programs” (e.g., job skills, work release, etc.) “work” rather on trying to find out what, in parole or probation supervision, is effective., This study.  The research described in this paper approaches the question of “how” to supervise offenders in the community at a rather basic level: Can training in certain supervisory “principles” affect the likelihood that an offender being supervised will, in the future, re-offend., Community corrections officers in Victoria, Australia, were given a five-day training course (the details of which are described on pages 32-33 of the paper).   Officers were encouraged to reward “prosocial” actions (such as keeping appointments, doing community work), they were trained to focus on problems that appeared to be related to offending, and they were trained to try to see things from the offender’s perspective.  The clients of these (relatively) newly trained corrections officers who followed the prescribed principles  were compared to the clients of those who did not follow it., Generally, the results were quite positive -- but largely in terms of the “pro-social” orientation of the community correctional workers.   There were fewer breaches of conditions, and, more importantly, fewer offences were committed one and four years later by those who were supervised by officers who had received and applied the special training., Conclusion.  The research described in this paper shows that a particular style of supervision can be effective -- one which focuses on reinforcing “pro-social” behaviour in the offender.  More importantly, it shows that particular orientations or supervisory styles can differentially affect the outcome of community corrections.   The “treatment” that was tested here is not “expensive” or “special.”    The paper shows that “doing supervision better” can have an impact. More generally, one could argue that this kind of research -- trying to find out what kinds of  “normal treatment” works best is important for us to do, routinely, in our own system., Reference: Trotter, Christopher.  The impact of different supervision practices in community corrections: Cause for optimism.  The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology, 1996, 29 (1), 29-46., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV1N1.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-1-no-1-%E2%80%93-september-1997,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 1, No. 1 – September 1997",Regular Issue,1997
Build it and they will come: Prison construction causes increased prison use.,"Background.  It is obviously a truism: the more prison cells a jurisdiction has, the more prisoners it will have.  The common assumption, however, is that prison construction follows demand: as prison populations increase, governments build more prisons.  The reasons why so many jurisdictions find that their prisons are always full is that they can’t keep up with the demand for space.  That is the assumption.    The opposing theory is that prison capacity -- whatever it might be in a jurisdiction -- puts a limit on the use of imprisonment.  Hence a jurisdiction that creates extra capacity will use it., This paper.  Orange County,  Florida provided a near perfect opportunity to investigate the impact of capacity on use.  In January 1992 they opened a new facility that increased their capacity to receive prisoners by 34%.  Furthermore, they had reliable daily data on their jail population as well as data on an obviously relevant factor -- the number of daily arrests made by police.  By having precise data (on a daily basis) the investigators could see whether the change in capacity had an impact on the jail population above and beyond any pre-existing trends., Findings.  Almost immediately after the new facilities were open, the jail population increased.  Within three to four weeks, the population had increased dramatically.  Statistical tests made it clear that the increase was not caused by increased police arrests.  And the increase that took place was independent of previous trends.  Equally important is the finding that “when jail beds were made available, they tended to be filled with minor law violators” (Page 285). A substantial source of supply for the new jail beds were misdemeanor probation violators., The authors of the paper conclude that “Because adding capacity may have a positive and substantive effect on jail incarceration, apart from the influence of police activity and beyond  the effect of preexisting incarceration trends, policy makers should remain cautious about adding capacity to reduce inmate overcrowding.  Additionally, because available capacity does appear to increase incarceration levels, especially for minor defendants, inmate overcrowding may be addressed more appropriately by greater reliance on nonincarcerative remedies” (Page 287)., Conclusion.  This paper exposes what may be a “Catch-22” for policy makers concerned with over-crowded prisons: the impact of providing more prison capacity is that more people will be sentenced to prison. The particular type of prisoners ending up in prison gives a strong hint about the mechanism: the presence of already full or overcrowded prisons acts as a disincentive to the sentencing or parole authority to make decisions which result in people at the margins (in this instance, minor offenders) going to prison.  Take away that disincentive, and imprisonment rates rise., The paper should also encourage those who might be considering inviting the private sector to enter the prison business in Canada to take a sober second look at such a policy. The private sector may have the capacity -- that government may lack -- to make quick decisions to build prisons.  Hence private involvement in providing prison space may, in fact, lead to more people being sent to prison., Reference: D’Alessio, Stewart J. and Lisa Stolzenberg (1997).  The effect of available capacity on jail incarceration: An empirical test of Parkinson’s Law.   Journal of Criminal Justice, 25 (4), 279-288., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV1N2.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-1-no-2-%E2%80%93-november-1997,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 1, No. 2 – November 1997",Regular Issue,1997
"Communities where residents can count on their neighbours to intervene when there is minor trouble, and where residents trust one another, are likely to have low levels of violence above and beyond the characteristics of the individuals who live in that neighbourhood.",", Background.  In the previous issue of Criminological Highlights, we presented a paper demonstrating that communities which teach their members to have social and moral obligations to others have less crime. The idea that there are characteristics of communities above and beyond the characteristics of individuals that are important in understanding levels of crime is not new, but at the same time, it is not an idea that has received much systematic research attention.  This study, coming from the “Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighbourhoods” demonstrates that there are characteristics of communities -- above and beyond the characteristics of individuals -- that are important “protectors” from crime., This study.  This study looked at victim reported crime in 343 “neighbourhood clusters” in Chicago.  These clusters were relatively small -- about 8000 people each -- and were designed to approximate local neighbourhoods in Chicago.  A measure which the authors call “collective efficacy” was assessed by interviewing 8782 people (at least 20 per neighbourhood cluster).  Respondents were asked how likely it was that their neighbours could be counted on to intervene in various ways if children were misbehaving, or committing minor offences, or if their local fire station was threatened with budget cuts.  In addition, they were asked various questions relating to social cohesion: whether neighbours are willing to help one another, whether people in the neighbourhood can be trusted, etc.   The answers to ten such questions were combined, for each neighbourhood, into a scale value of “collective efficacy.”  Various measures of the characteristics of those living in the neighbourhood were also obtained.  There were three measures: (1) How often residents reported various forms of violence to have occurred in their neighbourhood in the previous six months,  (2) whether they, or a member of their household, had experienced any violence while in the neighbourhood, and (3) whether a homicide had been recorded by the police as having occurred in the neighbourhood during that year (1995)., “Collective efficacy” obviously does not stand alone.  It turns out to be negatively related to some other factors.  Such factors included the concentration, within the community, of “disadvantaged”  people (the unemployed, those below the poverty line, single-parent families, etc.).  In addition, “collective efficacy” was lower in neighbourhoods that had higher proportions of those born outside the country and higher levels of “residential instability” (e.g., where people have moved a lot).  These relationships make sense for obvious reasons: communities where there may be a language barrier, or where people have not lived in the neighbourhood for long may “impede the capacity of residents to realize common values and achieve informal social controls.”, Findings.  Above and beyond the other factors,  “collective efficacy” (neighbourhood informal social control and cohesion) was a predictor of perceived neighbourhood violence, whether or not respondents had been the victim of violence, and whether a homicide had occurred in the neighbourhood., Conclusion. “Collective efficacy” (or neighbourhood informal social control and cohesion) is, in part, shaped by social and economic factors.  However, given its apparent independent impact on all three measures of violence, it appears that one way to address problems of crime is to consider how neighbourhoods themselves can be strengthened., Reference: Sampson, Robert J., Stephen W.

"Completing a victim impact statement does not make victims more satisfied with the criminal justice system. Those victims who expected the victim impact statement to have an effect, but did not believe it had, were particularly dissatisfied with the sentence.  Dissatisfaction with the sentence was the main determinant of dissatisfaction with the criminal justice system as a whole.",", Background. It is often presumed that allowing victim impact statements will ensure that victims are more satisfied with the criminal justice system because they are no longer legally excluded.  On the other hand, some have argued that giving victims an opportunity to express their views may create the expectation that their advice will be followed.  If their advice is then not followed, it may lead to increased disillusionment with the system., This paper.  Cases with an identifiable individual victim were chosen from the South Australian higher courts.  Some had filed a victim impact statement, some had not.  A survey questionnaire was sent to them by the Director of the Office of Crime Statistics in the Attorney General’s office., Findings.  Not surprisingly, most victims (96%) said that they wanted their victim impact statements used in sentencing, and most (71%) indicated that they expected it to have an impact on the sentence.  Fewer than half (46%), however, thought it had affected the sentence.  The net result was that for 34% of the victims, their expectation that they would have an impact was, in their view, unfulfilled.  Most importantly, there was no significant difference between those who had filled out a victim impact statement and those who had not, in the mean satisfaction rating of  the way in which the criminal justice system had handled their case., Satisfaction with the sentence was the main determinant of their overall satisfaction with the criminal justice system.  Satisfaction with the sentence was not significantly affected by whether or not the victim had filled out a victim impact statement.  However, those victims who expected the victim impact statement to have an impact on the sentence but believed it had not had such an impact (i.e.,  those with unfulfilled expectations) were  particularly dissatisfied with the sentence.  And,  of course, dissatisfaction with the sentence was the main determinant of dissatisfaction with the criminal justice system as a whole., Conclusion.  Some might believe that regardless of whether victim impact statements are helpful to the court, they may help demonstrate to the victim that the system is responsive to their concerns.  This does not seem to be the case.  The paper’s authors suggest that “if the victim impact statement practice is continued, efforts to prevent raised expectations, which result in a decrease in satisfaction with justice need to be taken” (p. 56).  The authors also noted that “although the victims wanted more and longer prison sentences than were actually imposed..., they also desired more orders of restitution, community service and license revocations than the court provided.... It suggests that other, more constructive outcomes such as restitution and compensation... or community service... are of considerable importance to the victims” (p. 56-7)., Reference: Erez, Edna, Leigh Roeger, and Frank Morgan (1997).  Victim harm, impact statements and victim satisfaction with justice: An Australian experience.

So-called “law and order” politicians may want prisons to be “a strict tough environment without creature comforts” but American prison wardens disagree. For the most part -- but with some notable exceptions --  they do not want normal prison programs and services reduced.,", Background.  Part of the “tough on crime” movement is to be “tough on prisoners.”   Some may talk about prisons as if they are country clubs, and suggest that prisons should provide only the basic necessities of life. Some state legislatures have passed laws restricting prisoner’s access to various programs., This study and its findings.   State prison wardens in the U.S. were surveyed. The main part of the survey included a list of 36 prison programs and services.  The wardens were asked whether each should be reduced or eliminated. Most wardens described their political philosophy as either “middle of the road” (53%) or conservative (39%); few (8%) were happy with the label “liberal”.  In ranking the various goals of prison, incapacitation and deterrence were placed above rehabilitation (defined as “to reform offenders so that they will return to society in a constructive rather than destructive way”).  However, retribution (defined as “to pay offenders back for the harm they have caused society”) was ranked lowest.  Wardens who were most opposed to the reduction of prison programs were also most likely to rank rehabilitation as one of the most important goals of their institution.  In contrast, those most in favour of eliminating prison programs were most likely to favour retribution., Those amenities that fewer than a quarter of state prison wardens wished to eliminate included:, The programs the majority wanted to eliminate (in addition to the exceptions noted above) were of two types: ones that were unusual for these prisons (e.g., cosmetic surgery or dentistry, air conditioning, conjugal visits) or which appear to cause problems for them (e.g., state funded legal services, tobacco smoking, non-regulation clothing)., Only 1% of the wardens indicated that the restrictions that have taken place in their prisons were initiated by the wardens themselves.  Part of the reason for this may be that most of the programs that are under fire for making prisons “too easy” are important time fillers for prisoners.  As these authors point out, “the problem in prison is one of excess time and few constructive activities in which to engage....” (Page 38)., Conclusion. The move to restrict programs and amenities within prisons (in the U.S.) does not come from the wardens, but does tend to be supported most by the wardens who favour “paying back offenders for the harm they have caused” over “reforming offenders so that they return to society and live constructive lives” as the primary goal of corrections.  One wonders whether those  in Canada who espouse differing views on this subject are similarly divided about what “corrections” should be all about., Reference: Johnson, W.

"The three strikes law in California was passed even though it was known by legislative committees to be seriously flawed, and even though it was known to imply heavy financial costs, and even though other “tougher” but more rational approaches were available.  The political and criminological lessons from California’s experience should be learned by all.",", Background.  The “three strikes” legislation in California is not unique.  And few jurisdictions (in North America, at least) are likely to be immune to the pressures which led to its passage. This paper chronicles the political history of California’s legislation, the changes in penal theory that enabled it to become law, and the claims that were made.   Rather than try to summarize the paper, a list of points with page references are provided., Conclusion:   The California three strikes legislation provides us with a case history of what can happen when electoral politics -- and to some extent rushed legislation -- takes precedence over rational evaluation of complex questions. Most sentencing systems punish repeat offenders more than first time offenders.  The difficulty is that this history illustrates that there are strong forces -- in the case of the three strikes legislation they included the prison guard’s association -- that coalesce in favour of legislation that cannot meet its stated goals but appears, on the surface, to provide quick and effective security., Reference: Vitiello, Michael (1997).

"Homelessness for Canadian male youth leads to involvement in crime.  Economic situations and prospects are important, but it is also the way these conditions are interpreted and explained that determine the youth’s involvement in criminal behaviour.",", Background.   Concern about homelessness and youth unemployment is probably widespread,  and at times that concern includes the impact of these factors on crime.  There is much research on the relationship between unemployment and crime.  The findings are somewhat inconsistent in part because the focus has usually been on “objective” measures rather than on the interpretations that are placed on labour market experiences., This paper. In an attempt to understand crime committed by homeless male youth, this paper analyzed the results of interviews with 200 male “street” youth in Edmonton, Alberta.  All were under age 24 and were not attending school. They all spent a fair amount of time “hanging around” on the street.  Three quarters of them had “no fixed address” for the previous year.   Standard self-report crime measures were obtained.  In addition, questions were asked about the youths’ interpretation of their own joblessness -- in particular whether they attributed their situation to themselves or others (government, industry)., Findings. For property crime, those who rejected the view that success would be the result of hard work were more likely to report having committed property crime, and this was more strongly the case for those with less overall income.  The length of time they had been unemployed was not itself an important factor, but the long term unemployed “who blamed the economy, government and private industry for their unemployment were more likely to engage in property crime” (p. 423).  Low amounts of legal income also led to increased amounts of property crime., For violent crime,  those who had been unemployed the longest and who rejected the view that success would come from hard work were most likely to report being violent, as was minimal legal income., As the authors conclude, “In addition to objective labour market and material factors, street youths’ perceptions of, and emotional reactions to, their labour market conditions help explain a range of offences.  Youths who reject the dominant meritocratic ideology are more likely to access illegitimate means to obtain monetary and material goods.”  They also point out that “long-term unemployment and sparse employment histories tend to undermine perceptions of equal opportunity and lead the youths to blame the government, private industry, and the economy for their condition. The combination of these attributions with extensive joblessness, and a poor employment record increases youths participation in crime.”   Thus it is “labour market conditions and the way in which they are reacted to that work individually and together to increase criminal behavior” (p. 425)., Conclusion.  The results suggest that the problem of unemployment with these youth is not so much that it will cause crime directly.  It is more that the experience of unemployment will, for some youth, create long term explanations for unemployment that are themselves criminogenic.  The authors note that “homelessness is extremely criminogenic, but it is the youth’s reactions to the conditions that leads to criminal behaviour”  (Page 425)., Reference.  Baron, Stephen W. and Timothy F.

The community corrections conundrum: those who appear to be most likely to “need” intensive supervision (in contrast to “normal” parole or probation supervision) are the very same people who are most likely to fail when released.  Intensive supervision of those in the community may turn out to be a complex way of setting people up to fail.,", Background.  It has been established in previous studies that intensive supervision of offenders who are in some kind of community program leads to more technical violations than “normal” release.  This is a non-trivial problem from the perspective of those advocating the use of  “intensive supervision” instead of imprisonment because the impact may be an increase in technical charges (e.g., for violation of a court order) and, as a result increased imprisonment., This study.  This study examined those who were given temporary release from prison in Vermont in preparation of release.  The groups who were examined were, in fact, a rather heterogeneous group including some violent offenders with serious treatment needs and some who had committed minor crimes and had little or no need for treatment. The study came about as a result of an administrative accident.  A new community program of intensely supervised house arrest had been set up by the state Department of Corrections but for various reasons,  very few people were assigned to it.  In order to use the additional staff sensibly, staff were allowed to supervise offenders on release prior to the end of their prison sentence.  The result was that a group of offenders -- more or less unselected -- were subject to intensive surveillance.  Because of this, more offenders were released early (administrators felt more secure than they had without this intensive supervision)., Findings.  Not surprisingly, more offenders under intensive supervision were revoked than had occurred in the past (under normal procedures) -- almost always because of rule violations (not new offences).   In fact, 34% had their release revoked -- 95% of them by corrections officers.  The reasons sounded predictable: substance use (almost always alcohol) (33%), escape or “out of place” (25%), new crime (6%) or because they were subject of a criminal investigation (11%), as well as some other reasons (25%)., Those revoked tended to be slightly younger, more likely to be seen as needing drug treatment, less likely to be needing treatment regarding sexual behaviour, and more likely to have unstable employment. Those with a current or past property felony or a misdemeanour assault were more likely to be revoked.  And those with longer records were more likely to be revoked.  Institutional misbehaviour (measured both as frequency and as seriousness) correlated with revocation., Conclusion.  “The typical candidate for intensive supervision is often precisely the type of offender who is most likely to fail in the community.  Moreover, the present culture of community supervision only exacerbates this problem by encouraging officers to [return those who violate conditions to jail]....   When we consider that intensive supervision programs largely select rule breakers who are supervised by rule enforcers, we might easily conclude that the system is programmed to fail” (Page 116)., Reference: Ryan, James E.  (1997) Who gets revoked: A comparison of intensive supervision successes and failures in Vermont.  Crime and Delinquency, 43 (1), 104-118., Back to top",https://crimsl.utoronto.ca/sites/crimsl.utoronto.ca/files/CrimHighlightsV1N2.pdf,https://www.crimsl.utoronto.ca/research-publications/faculty-publications/criminological-highlights-vol-1-no-2-%E2%80%93-november-1997,"Criminological Highlights Vol. 1, No. 2 – November 1997",Regular Issue,1997
"Leading American criminologists and American police chiefs agree: The death penalty does not significantly reduce the number of homicides.  Debates about the death penalty distract politicians from focusing on real solutions to crime problems, and politicians support the death penalty to show that they are “tough on crime”.",", Background.   Public opinion polls in the United States and in Canada typically show a fair amount of support for the death penalty.  In the U.S., according to a Gallup Poll in 1994, 80% supported the death penalty. Questions about support of the death penalty require an alternative choice in order to be meaningful.  In 1991 it was found that support for capital punishment dropped from 76% to 53% when people were given a choice between capital punishment and life in prison without parole (p. 3).   Obviously support for capital punishment exists for a number of reasons.  The two reasons most often expressed are that it is appropriate for murder,  given the nature of the crime, and that it will deter other potential murderers.  Belief in deterrence turns out to be important for many people:  a 1991 U.S. Gallup poll found that support for capital punishment dropped from 76% to 52% when people were asked “if they would support the death penalty if new evidence proved that the death penalty does not act as a deterrent to murder” (p. 4)., This study.  Since there is some disagreement about how experts view the death penalty, the authors of this paper decided to compare two groups: eminent American criminologists and police chiefs and country sheriffs from all parts of the U.S.  The police and sheriff study comes from 386 randomly selected chiefs and sheriffs conducted in 1995 by other researchers as part of another study.   The criminologists consists of all of the living presidents and past-presidents of three professional and academic criminological organizations (the American Society of Criminology, the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences, and the Law and Society Association). Ninety-six percent returned the completed questionnaire., Findings.  The police chiefs and criminology presidents were presented with three statements and asked whether each was accurate:, Obviously police chiefs are not quite as certain as criminology presidents that the death penalty is ineffective as a deterrent and supported largely for political purposes.  Nevertheless, the vast majority do take this position., Conclusion.  If expert views of capital punishment are important, then it is useful to know that there is consensus about the ineffectiveness of the death penalty among elite criminologists.  And it is interesting that the majority of  U.S. police chiefs agree with the academics.  One suspects that many other criminologists, not just the presidents of organizations would support the view that there are more important crime and criminal justice issues to spend one’s time on than capital punishment., Reference.  Radelet, Michael L. and Ronald L Akers.
